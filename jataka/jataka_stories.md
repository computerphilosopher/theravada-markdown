A monkey outwits a crocodile in Ja 57, above. The following variant, from Russia (Moscow district) may be of interest. It was given me by Mr I. Nestor Schnurmann, who heard it from his nurse (about 1860). Once upon a time, the king of the Fishes was wanting in wisdom. His advisers told him that once he could get the heart of the fox, he would become wise. So he sent a deputation, consisting of the great magnates of the sea, whales and others. âOur king wants your advice on some state affairs.â The fox, flattered, consented. A whale took him on his back. On the way the waves beat upon him; at last he asked what they really wanted. They said, what their king really wanted was to eat his heart, by which he hoped to become clever. He said, âWhy didnât you tell me that before? I would gladly sacrifice my life for such a worthy object. But we foxes always leave our hearts at home. Take me back and Iâll fetch it. Otherwise Iâm sure your king will be angry.â So they took him back. As soon as he got near the shore, he leaped on land, and cried âAh you fools! Have you ever heard of an animal not carrying his heart with him?â and ran off.

# Ja 001 1 Apaá¹á¹akajÄtaka This JÄtaka is quoted in the MilindapaÃ±ho, p. 289 of Rhys Davidsâ translation in Vol. 35 of Sacred Books of the East.
The Birth Story about What Is Unquestionable (1s)

## Alternative Titles
No alternative titles available.

## Analysis
In the present 500 friends of AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika convert to Buddhism, but later fall away. The Buddha reproves them for failing in their refuge, and tells a story of a wise and a foolish merchant in the past. The foolish one listened to Yakkhas who led him astray, and he lost all his men and merchandise; the wise one safely guided his caravan across the desert.


The Bodhisatta = the wise caravan leader (paá¹á¸itasatthavÄhaputta),

the Buddhaâs disciples = the wise caravan leaderâs followers (paá¹á¸itasatthavÄhaputtaparisa),

Devadatta = the foolish caravan leader (bÄlasatthavÄhaputta),

Devadattaâs followers = his followers.

## Full Story
This 
The Birth Story of the Present usually begins by quoting, as a catchword, the first words of the subsequent 
gÄthÄ
 [this one however, omits to do that.]
 discourse 
[1.1] {1.95}
 regarding Truth was delivered by the Fortunate One, while he was dwelling in the Great Monastery at Jetavana near SÄvatthi. But who, you ask, was it that provoked this tale?


Well, it was the Treasurerâs five hundred friends, disciples of the sectarians. 
Literally âsectariesâ; but usually translated âheretics,â a term which has come to have too theological a connotation to be applicable to philosophers. The six rivals with whom Gotama had chiefly to compete were PÅ«raá¹a Kassapa, Makkhali GosÄla, Ajita KesakambalÄ«, Pakudha KaccÄyana, SaÃ±jaya Belaá¹­á¹­hiputta, and Nigaá¹á¹­ha NÄthaputta (see, 
e.g.
, the 
SÄmaÃ±Ã±aphala Sutta
 in the 
DÄ«ghanikÄya
, Vol. 1. p. 47).


For one day AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika 
This is a surname [really an epithet], meaning literally âfeeder of the poor.â His ordinary name was Sudatta. See the account in the 
Vinaya
 (
Cullavagga
, vi. 4, 9) of how he bought from Prince Jeta the latterâs grove for as much money as would pave the ground, and how he built thereon the Great Monastery for the Buddha.
 the Treasurer took his friends the five hundred disciples of other schools, and went off with them to Jetavana, where also he had a great store brought of garlands, perfumes, and unguents, together with oil, honey, molasses, cloths, and cloaks. After due salutation to the TathÄgata, he made his offering to him of the garlands and the like, and handed over to the Saá¹gha of monks the medicinal oil and so forth together with the cloths; and, this done, he took his seat on one side eschewing the six faults in 
[1.2]
 sitting down. Likewise, those disciples of other schools saluted the Buddha, and took their seats close by the side of AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika â gazing upon the Teacherâs countenance, glorious as the full moon, upon his excellent presence endowed with the signs and marks of Buddhahood and encompassed to a fathomâs length with light, and upon the rich glory that marks a Buddha, a glory which issued as it were in paired garlands, pair upon pair.


Then, though in thunderous tones as of a young lion roaring in the Red Valley or as of a storm-cloud in the rainy season, bringing down as it were the Ganges of the Heavens 
i.e.
 the Milky Way.
 
{1.96}
 and seeming to weave a chaplet of jewels â yet in a voice of eightfold perfection, the charm of which ravished the ear, he preached to them the Dhamma in a discourse full of sweetness and bright with varied beauty.


They, after hearing the Teacherâs discourse, rose up with hearts converted, and with due salutation to the One with Ten Powers, burst asunder the other doctrines in which they had taken refuge, and betook themselves to the Buddha as their refuge. Thenceforth without ceasing they used to go with AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika, carrying in their hands perfumes and garlands and the like, to hear the Dhamma in the monastery; and they abounded in generosity, kept the Precepts, and kept the weekly Uposatha.


Now the Fortunate One went from SÄvatthi back to RÄjagaha again. As soon as the TathÄgata had gone, they burst asunder their new faith, and returning to the other doctrines as their refuge, reverted to their original state.


After some seven or eight monthsâ stay, the Fortunate One came back to Jetavana. Once again too did AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika come with those friends of his to the Teacher, make his salutation and offering of perfumes and the like, and take his seat on one side. And the friends also saluted the Fortunate One and took their seats in like manner. Then did AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika tell the Fortunate One how, when the TathÄgata had departed on his alms pilgrimage, his friends had forsaken their refuge for the old doctrines again, and had reverted to their original state.


Opening the lotus of his mouth, as though it were a casket of jewels, scented with scents divine and filled with divers perfumes by virtue of his having ever spoken aright throughout myriad aeons, the Fortunate One made his sweet voice come forth, as he enquired, âIs the report true that you, disciples, have forsaken the Three Refuges 
i.e.
 the Buddha, the Dhamma he preached, and the Saá¹gha he founded. 
Infra
 this triad is spoken of as the âThree Gems.â
 for the refuge of other doctrines?â


And when they, unable to conceal the fact, had confessed, saying: âIt is true, Fortunate One,â then said the Teacher, âDisciples, not between the bounds of hell 
Strictly speaking Buddhism knows no hells, only purgatories, which â though places of torment â are temporary and educational.
 below and the highest heaven above, not in all the infinite worlds that stretch right and left, is there the equal, much less the superior, of a Buddha in the excellences which spring from obeying the Precepts and from other virtuous conduct.â


Then he declared to them the excellences of the Three Jewels as they are revealed in the sacred texts, the following amongst the number, âOf all creatures, monks, whether footless and so on, of these the TathÄgata is the chief,â âWhatsoever riches there be in this or in other worlds and so on,â and, âVerily the chief of the faithful and so on.â Thence he went on to say, âNo disciples, male or female, who seek refuge in the Three Jewels that are endowed with such peerless excellences, are ever reborn into hell and the like states; but, released from all rebirth into states of suffering, they pass to the Realm of Devas and there receive great glory. Therefore, in forsaking such a refuge for that offered by other doctrines, you have gone astray.â 
[1.3]


And here the following sacred texts should be cited to make it clear that none who, to find release and the supreme good, have sought refuge in the Three Jewels, shall be reborn into states of suffering: 
{1.97}

âThose who have refuge in the Buddha found,

Shall not pass hence to states of suffering;

Straightway, when they shall quit their human frame,

A Deva form these faithful ones shall fill. 
The word 
Deva
, which I have retained in its PÄli form, means an âangel,â rather than a âgod,â in the godless creed of the Buddhist. See hereon Rhys Davids in his âBuddhist Suttas,â page 162.


Those who have refuge in the Dhamma found 
Dhp v. 188-192. [I have replaced Chalmersâ very partial translation of the next five verses with a complete one by Burlingame from his translation of the Dhp and its commentary.]

Shall not pass hence to states of suffering;

Straightway, when they shall quit their human frame,

A Deva form these faithful ones shall fill.


Those who have refuge in the Saá¹gha found

Shall not pass hence to states of suffering;

Straightway, when they shall quit their human frame,

A Deva form these faithful ones shall fill.


To many a refuge men go, to mountains and to forests,

To shrines and trees and groves, when terrified with fear.

Such is no sure refuge, such is no final refuge;

Not by resorting to such a refuge does a man obtain release from all suffering.


Whoever seeks refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saá¹gha,

Whoever, with clear understanding, beholds the Four Noble Truths,

Suffering, the Origin of Suffering, the Escape from Suffering,


And the Noble Eightfold Path of Escape from Suffering,

To this sure refuge, to this supreme refuge,

By resorting to this refuge, he obtains release from all suffering.â

But the Teacher did not end his teaching to them at this point; for he went on to say, âDisciples, meditation on the thought of the Buddha, meditation on the thought of the Dhamma, meditation on the thought of the Saá¹gha, this it is that gives entry to and fruition of the First, the Second, the Third, and the Fourth Paths to Bliss.â 
See note 2 on p. 8.
 And when he had preached the Dhamma to them in these and other ways, he said: âIn forsaking such a refuge as this, you have gone astray.â


And here the gift of the several paths to those who meditate on the thought of the Buddha and so forth, should be made clear by such discourses as the following, âOne thing there is, monks, which, if practised and developed, conduces to utter loathing of the worldâs vanities, to the cessation of passion, to the end of being, to peace, to deep knowledge, to Awakening, to NibbÄna. What is this one thing? The meditation on the thought of the Buddha.â


When he had thus exhorted the disciples, the Fortunate One said: âSo too in times past, disciples, the men who jumped to the fatuous conclusion that what was no refuge was a real refuge, fell a prey to Amanussas in a Yakkha-haunted wilderness and were utterly destroyed; while the men who clave to the absolute and indisputable truth, prospered in the self-same wilderness.â And when he had said this, he became silent.


Then, rising up from his seat and saluting the Fortunate One, the layman AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika burst into praises, and with clasped hands raised in reverence to his forehead, spoke thus, âIt is clear to us, sir, that in these present days these disciples were led by error into forsaking the supreme refuge. But the bygone destruction of those opinionated ones in the wilderness haunted by Amanussas, and the prospering of the men who clave to the truth, are hidden from us and known only to you. 
{1.98}
 May it please the Fortunate One, as though causing the full moon to rise in the sky, to make this thing clear to us.â
 [1.4]
 Then said the Fortunate One, âIt was solely to brush away the worldâs difficulties that by the display of the Ten Perfections 
i.e.
 generosity, virtue, renunciation, wisdom, effort, patience, truth, determination, loving-kindness, and equanimity. (See the 
CariyÄpiá¹­aka
, pp. 45-7 of the PÄli text edited by Dr Morris for the PÄli Text Society); see also 
JÄtaka
 No. 35 &c.
 through myriad aeons I won omniscience. Give ear and hearken, as closely as if you were filling a tube of gold with lionâs marrow.â


Having thus excited the Treasurerâs attention, he uncovered what rebirth had concealed from them, as though, after cleaving the storehouse of the snows, he were driving the full moon through the space between the worlds.

This story ended, the Teacher said: âThus it was, layman, that in times past the fatuous came to utter destruction, while those who clave to the truth, escaping from the Amanussasâ hands, reached their goal in safety and came back to their homes again.â And when he had thus linked the two stories together, he, as the Buddha, spoke the following verse for the purposes of this lesson on the Dhamma:

Some have an unquestionable basis, while the foolish speak of another way, the intelligent, understanding it, should take hold of the unquestionable. 
{1.105}

Thus did the Fortunate One teach this lesson respecting Dhamma. And he went on to say, âWhat is called walking by truth, not only bestows the three happy endowments, the six heavens of the realms of sense, and the endowments of the higher Realm of Brahma, but finally is the giver of Arahatship 
{1.106}
; while what is called walking by untruth entails rebirth in the four states of punishment or in the lowest families of mankind.â Further, the Teacher went on to expound in sixteen ways the Four Truths, 
These four cardinal truths of Buddhism are as follows: (i) individual existence entails pain; (ii) cravings cause the continuance of individual existence; (iii) with the disappearance of cravings, individual existence also would disappear; and (iv) cravings disappear by following the Noble Eightfold Path pointed out by the Buddha. (See hereon Rhys Davidsâ Hibbert Lecture for 1881.)
 at the close of which all those five hundred disciples were established in the Fruit of the First Path. 
The normal road to the Buddhist ideal after conversion is divided into four successive stages, called the 
cattÄro maggÄ
 or âfour paths.â The first of these is that trodden by the 
sotÄpanna
 (one âwho has entered the streamâ which flows down to the ocean of NibbÄna), who is assured of ultimately reaching his goal but has first to undergo seven more existences none of which can be in a state of suffering; the second path is that trodden by the 
sakadÄgÄmÄ«
, the disciple whose imperfections have been, so far eradicated that he has only to âreturnâ to a human-form once more before attaining NibbÄna; the third path is that of the 
anagÄmÄ«
, the disciple who will ânot returnâ to earth, but will attain the goal from a Brahma realm; whilst the fourth and last is Arahatship, which is NibbÄna. Each of these four stages is further subdivided into two sub-stages, the lower called âthe path,â and the higher âthe fruit.â (See 
MahÄparinibbÄnasutta
 [DN 16] and the commentary thereon of the 
Sumaá¹galavilÄsinÄ«
.)


Having delivered his lesson and his teaching, and having told the two stories and established the connection linking them together, the Teacher concluded by identifying the JÄtaka as follows, âDevadatta was the foolish young merchant of those days; his followers were the followers of that merchant; the followers of the Buddha were the followers of the wise merchant, who was myself.â

## Full Story
âUntiring.â
 This discourse was delivered by the Fortunate One while he was dwelling at SÄvatthi.


About whom, you ask? About a monk who gave up persevering.


Tradition says that, while the TathÄgata was dwelling at SÄvatthi, there came to Jetavana a scion of a SÄvatthi family, who, on hearing a discourse by the Teacher, realised that sensual desires breed suffering, and was admitted to the first stage of the Saá¹gha, then the higher ordination, and after five years, 
[The translator had a note here, full of misunderstandings, which also influenced his wrong interpretation of the text, which I have corrected above.]
 when he had learned two summaries and had trained himself in the methods of Insight, he obtained from the Teacher a theme for meditation which commended itself to him. Retiring to a forest, he passed there the rainy season; but for all his striving during the three months, he could not develop a glimmer or an inkling of Insight. So the thought came to him, âThe Teacher said there were four types of men, and I must belong to the lowest of all; in this birth, I think, there is neither Path nor Fruit for me. What good shall I do by living in the forest? I will go back to the Teacher, and live my life beholding the glories of the Buddhaâs presence and listening to his sweet teachings.â And back again to Jetavana he came.


Now his friends and intimates said: âSir, it was you who obtained from the Teacher a theme for meditation and departed to live the solitary life of a sage. Yet here you are back again, going about enjoying fellowship. Can it be that you have won the crown of the monksâ vocation and that you will never know rebirth?â âSirs, as I won neither Path nor Fruit, I felt myself doomed to futility, and so gave up persevering and came back.â âYou have done wrong, sir, in showing a faint heart when you had devoted yourself to the Dhamma of the dauntless Teacher. 
{1.107}
 Come, let us bring you to the TathÄgataâs notice.â And they took him with them to the Teacher.
 [1.10]


When the Teacher became aware of their coming, he said: âMonks, you bring with you this monk against his will. What has he done?â âSir, after devoting himself to so absolutely true a Dhamma, this monk has given up persevering in the solitary life of a sage, and has come back.â


Then said the Teacher to him, âIs it true, as they say, that you, monk, have given up persevering?â âIt is true, Fortunate One.â âBut how comes it that, after devoting yourself to such a Dhamma, you, monk, should be the one to show yourself not a man desiring little, contented, solitary, and determined, but a man lacking perseverance? Was it not you who were so stout-hearted in bygone days? Was it not by you single-handed, thanks to your perseverance, that in a sandy desert the men and the oxen belonging to a caravan of five hundred carts got water and were cheered? And how is it that, now, you are giving in?â These words sufficed to give heart to that monk.


Hearing this talk, the monks asked the Fortunate One, saying: âSir, the present faintheartedness of this monk is clear to us; but hidden from us is the knowledge of how, by the perseverance of this single man, the men and oxen got water in a sandy desert and were cheered. This is known only to you who are omniscient; pray tell us about it.â


âHearken, then, monks,â said the Fortunate One; and, having excited their attention, he made clear the thing that rebirth had concealed from them.

When the Supreme Buddha had delivered this discourse, he, after Fully Awakening, uttered this verse:




1. AkilÄsuno, vaá¹á¹upathe khaá¹antÄ,

Udaá¹gaá¹e tattha papaá¹ avinduá¹,

Evaá¹ munÄ« viriyabalÅ«papanno,

AkilÄsu vinde hadayassa santin-ti.






Untiring, digging in a sandy place, in the open, they found drinking water, so the sage, endowed with strength of effort, untiring, finds peace right here in his heart. 
{1.110}






toggle word commentary






In this connection, 
untiring
 means not being lazy, having made an effort.


The sandy place
 is said to be sandy, having sand; on a sandy path is the meaning.


Digging
 means digging the ground.


In the open â¦
 in a place where people wander about, on an open piece of land, this is the meaning.


There
 means there on a sandy road.


They found water
 means they obtained water. Because water is in a drinkable state 
drinking water
 is said. Or, a lot of water is 
drinking water
, a great deal of water is the meaning. 
This sounds odd, but it probably means that when there is a lot of water, as in a large river or lake, it will be relatively clean, and therefore drinkable. Whereas a small puddle of water may be muddy and undrinkable. 


So
 is used to indicate the simile.


The sage
, sageness is said to be knowledge, or a certain sagacity of body and so on, 
The three sagacities are sagacity of body, speech and mind. 
 the person who is endowed with that is said to be 
a sage
.


These: a sage with a home, a sage without a home, a sage in training, a sage beyond training, a sage who is an Independent Buddha, a Sage of Sages, these are the various kinds.


In this connection, a sage with a home means a householder who has attained fruition, one who knows the dispensation.


A sage without a home means such a one who has gone forth.


A sage in training means in one of the seven trainings. 
I.e. one who has attained Path or Fruit as a Stream-Enterer, a Once-Returner, a Non-Returner, as one who has the Path to Worthiness (
Arahatta
).  


A sage beyond training is one who has destroyed the pollutants. 
i.e. one who has Fruit of Worthiness (
Arahatta
). 


A sage who is an Independent Buddha means an Independent Sambuddha.


A Sage of Sages means a Perfect Sambuddha.


But in this meaning, because of being a benefactor of all he is reckoned a sage, when endowed with wisdom he is a 
sage
, so it should be seen.


Endowed with strength of effort
 means endowed with effort and strength of body and the strength of knowledge.


Untiring
 means not being lazy, thinking:


Willingly, let only skin, tendons and bones remain, let the flesh and blood in the body dry up completely. 
This is a versification of a phrase said many times in the discourses, where it appears in this prose phrase: 
kÄmaá¹ taco ca nhÄru ca aá¹­á¹­hi ca avasissatu, sarÄ«re upassussatu maá¹salohitaá¹
. See MN 70 KÄ«á¹­Ägirisutta, 
passim
. 


so one who is said to be endowed with the four factors, 
Presumably referring to the four factors of being 
tapassÄ«, lÅ«kha, jegucchÄ«
 and 
pavivitta
 (ascetic, coarse, scrupulous and secluded), see MahÄsÄ«hanÄdasutta (MN 12), and 
passim
.
 who is endowed with effort, is not lazy.


Finds peace right here in his heart
 means by causing a coolness of mind, of the heart-material, 
peace
 comes to be reckoned, what is reckoned as the absorptions, insight, super knowledges, the Path to knowledge of Arahatta, the noble Dhamma is found, is received, this is the meaning.


Therefore the Fortunate One said:


The lazy one suffers, monastics, 
SN 2.22 Dutiyadasabalasutta.
 being full of unskilful wrong thoughts, bringing to ruin his greatest good. One with effort aroused lives happily, monastics, secluded from unskilful wrong thoughts, fulfilling his greatest good. The highest good, monastics, is not attained by the weak.


Thus in many discourses it is explained in detail that the lazy one has a life of suffering, and that the one with effort aroused has a life of happiness is explained.


But here the one with effort aroused, free from clinging, having insight, whose happy life would be attained by strength of effort, is being shown:


âSo the sage, endowed with strength of effort, untiring, finds peace right here) in his heart,â
 is said.


This is what is said: Just as tradesmen who are 
untiring, digging in a sandy place
, obtain water, so in this dispensation, being 
untiring
, the wise monastic who exerts himself obtains peace in his heart, which consists of the absorptions and so on.


âYou, monk, previously, just for the purpose of gaining water, made an effort, but now in such a dispensation that leads out through giving path and fruit, why would you give up effort?â




This discourse ended, he preached the Four Truths, at the close whereof the fainthearted monk was established in the highest fruit of all, which is Arahatship. Having told these two stories, the Teacher established the connection linking them both together, and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThis fainthearted monk of today was in those days the serving lad who, persevering, broke the rock and gave water to all the people; the Buddhaâs followers were the rest of the people of the caravan; and I myself was their leader.â

Untiring, digging in a sandy place, in the open, they found drinking water, so the sage, endowed with strength of effort, untiring, finds peace right here in his heart.

## Analysis
In the present a monk is about to give up striving. The Buddha tells a story of two merchants, one of whom attempts to cheat a poor family out of its riches, while the other paid a decent price for their golden bowl. 
[The moral, it seems, doesnât quite fit, as the foolish merchant didnât give up, but was simply too greedy to take immediate advantage of the situation.] 


The Bodhisatta = the wise merchant (paá¹á¸itavÄá¹ija),

Devadatta = the foolish merchant (bÄlavÄá¹ija).

## Full Story
âIf here you miss being certain.â
 
[1.12]
 This lesson too was taught by the Fortunate One while at SÄvatthi, also about a monk who gave up persevering.


For, when the man was brought by the monks exactly as in the foregoing case, the Teacher said: âYou, monk, who after devoting yourself to this glorious dispensation which bestows Path and Fruit, 
{1.111}
 are giving up persevering, will suffer long, like the hawker of Seri who lost a golden bowl worth a hundred thousand pieces.â


The monks asked the Fortunate One to explain this to them. The Fortunate One made clear this thing concealed from them by rebirth.

When the Supreme Buddha had ended this lesson, he, after Fully Awakening, uttered this verse:

If here you miss being certain of results in the True Dhamma, for a long time you will suffer, like the merchant in SerivÄ.

After having thus delivered his discourse in such a way as to lead up to Arahatship, the Teacher expounded the Four Truths, at the close whereof the fainthearted monk was established in that highest fruit of all, which is Arahatship. And, after telling the two stories, the Teacher made the connection linking them both together, and identified the JÄtaka by saying in conclusion, âIn those days Devadatta was the foolish hawker; and I myself was the wise and good hawker.â

In the present the story is told of MahÄpanthaka and his brother, Cullapanthaka. The former, gaining faith, attained easily, while the latter struggled till he was directly guided by the Buddha himself. The Buddha then tells a story showing how, in a previous life, Cullapanthaka had taken his advice and become rich beyond measure.


The Bodhisatta = the wealthy man Cullaka (Cullakaseá¹­á¹­hi),

Cullapanthaka = his little pupil (cullantevÄsika).

## Full Story
âEven with little.â
 
{1.114}
 This story was told by the Teacher about the elder named Cullapanthaka, while in JÄ«vakaâs Mango-grove 
JÄ«vaka, a prominent lay-follower of the Buddha, was physician to the Magadha king Seniya BimbisÄra. See, for his history, the account in the 
Vinaya
 (
MahÄvagga
 viii. 1).
 near RÄjagaha. And here an account of Cullapanthakaâs birth must be given. Tradition tells us that the daughter of a rich merchantâs family in RÄjagaha actually stooped to intimacy with a slave. Becoming alarmed lest her misconduct should get known, she said to the slave, âWe canât live on here; for if my mother and father come to know of this wrong of ours, they will tear us limb from limb. Let us go and live afar off.â So with their belongings in their hands they stole together out by the hardly-opened door, and fled away, they cared not whither, to find a shelter beyond the ken of her family. Then they went and lived together in a certain place, with the result that she conceived. And when her full time was nearly come, she told her husband and said: âIf I am taken in labour away from kith and kin, that will be a trouble to both of us. So let us go home.â 
[It was expected that the wife would return to her parents to give birth in those days, as we witness MahÄmÄyÄ trying to do, before the birth of Siddhattha.]


First he 
[1.15]
 agreed to start today, and then he put it off till the morrow; and so he let the days slip by, till she thought to herself, âThis fool is so conscious of his great offence that he dares not go. Oneâs parents are oneâs best friends; so whether he goes or stays, I must go.â So, when he went out, she put all her household matters in order and set off home, telling her next-door neighbour where she was going. Returning home, and not finding his wife, but discovering from the neighbours that she had started off from home, he hurried after her and came up with her on the road; and then and there she was taken in labour.


âWhatâs this, my dear?â said he.


âI have given birth to a son, my husband,â said she.


Accordingly, as the very thing had now happened which was the only reason for the journey, they both agreed that it was no good going on now, and so turned back again. And as their child had been born by the way, they called him âPanthaka.â
 {1.115}


Not long after, she was with child again, and everything fell out as before. And as this second child too was born by the way, they called him âPanthakaâ too, distinguishing the elder as MahÄpanthaka and the younger as Cullapanthaka. Then, with both their children, they again went back to their own home.


Now, as they were living there, their way-child heard other boys talking of their uncles and grandfathers and grandmothers; so he asked his mother whether he hadnât got relations like the other boys. âOh yes, my dear,â said his mother, âbut they donât live here. Your grandfather is a wealthy merchant in the city of RÄjagaha, and you have plenty of relations there.â âWhy donât we go there, mother?â She told the boy the reason why they stayed away; but, as the children kept on speaking about these relations, she said to her husband, âThe children are always plaguing me. Are my parents going to eat us at sight? Come, let us show the children their grandfatherâs family.â âWell, I donât mind taking them there; but I really could not face your parents.â âAll right, so long as, some way or other, the children come to see their grandfatherâs family,â said she.


So those two took their children and coming in due course to RÄjagaha put up in a public rest-house by the city gate. Then, taking with them the two children, the woman caused their coming to be made known to her parents. The latter, on hearing the message, returned this answer, âTrue, it is strange to be without children unless one has renounced the world in quest of Arahatship. Still, so great is the guilt of the pair towards us that they may not stand in our sight. Here is a sum of money for them: let them take this and retire to live where they will. But the children they may send here.â Then the merchantâs daughter took the money so sent her, and dispatched the children by the messengers. So the children grew up in their grandfatherâs house â Cullapanthaka being of tender years, while MahÄpanthaka used to go with his grandfather to hear the One with Ten Powers preach the Dhamma. And by constant hearing of the Dhamma from the Teacherâs own lips, the ladâs heart yearned to renounce the world for the life of a monk.


âWith your permission,â said he to his grandfather, âI should like to join the Saá¹gha.â âWhat do I hear?â cried the old man. âWhy, it would give me greater joy to see you join the Saá¹gha than to see the whole world join. Become a monk, if you feel able.â And he took him to the Teacher.


âWell, merchant,â said the Teacher, âhave you brought your boy with you?â âYes sir, this is my grandson, who wishes to join your Saá¹gha.â 
{1.116}
 Then the Teacher sent for a monk, and told him to admit the lad to the Saá¹gha; and the monk repeated the Formula of the Perishable Body 
Buddhism teaches the impermanence of things, and chief of the trains of thought for realising this doctrine is the meditation on the body and its 32 parts (see 
SuttanipÄta
 1.11, and the 12th 
JÄtaka
 
infra
). At the present day every novice in Ceylon, when invested with the yellow robe of the Saá¹gha, repeats the verses which enumerate the 32 impurities.
 and 
[1.16]
 admitted the lad as a novice. When the latter had learned by heart many words of the Buddha, and was old enough, he was admitted as a full monk. He now gave himself up to earnest thought till he became an Arahat; and as he passed his days in the enjoyment of Absorption and the paths, he thought whether he could not impart the like happiness to Cullapanthaka. So he went to his grandfather the merchant, and said: âGreat merchant, with your consent, I will admit Cullapanthaka to the Saá¹gha.â âPray do so, venerable sir,â was the reply.


Then the elder admitted the lad Cullapanthaka and established him in the Ten Precepts. But Cullapanthaka proved a dullard: with four monthsâ study he failed to get by heart this single verse:

âLo! Like a fragrant lotus at the dawn

Of day, full-blown, with virgin wealth of scent,

Behold the Buddhaâs glory shining forth,

As in the vaulted heaven beams the sun!â

For, we are told, in the Buddhahood of Kassapa this Cullapanthaka, having himself attained to knowledge as a monk, laughed to scorn a dull monk who was learning a passage by heart. His scorn so confused the dull monk, that the latter could not learn or recite the passage. And now, in consequence, on joining the Saá¹gha he himself proved a dullard. Each new line he learned drove the last out of his memory; and four months slipped away while he was struggling with this single verse. Said his elder brother to him, âPanthaka, you are not equal to receiving this dispensation. In four whole months you have been unable to learn a single verse. How then can you hope to crown your vocation with supreme success? Leave the monastery.â But, though thus expelled by his brother, Cullapanthaka was so attached to the Buddhaâs dispensation that he did not want to become a layman.


Now at that time MahÄpanthaka was acting as steward. And JÄ«vaka KomÄrabhacca, going to his mango-grove with a large present of perfumes and flowers for the Teacher, had presented his offering and listened to a discourse; then, rising from his seat and bowing to the One with Ten Powers, he went up to MahÄpanthaka and asked, âHow many monks are there, venerable sir, with the Teacher?â âJust 500, sir.â âWill you bring the 500 monks, with the Buddha at their head, to take their meal at my house tomorrow?â âLay disciple, one of them named Cullapanthaka is a dullard and makes no progress in the Faith,â said the elder, âI accept the invitation for everyone but him.â
 {1.117}


Hearing this, Cullapanthaka thought to himself, âIn accepting the invitation for all these monks, the elder carefully accepts so as to exclude me. This proves that my brotherâs affection for me is dead. What have I to do with this dispensation? I will become a layman and live in the exercise of generosity and other good works of a lay person.â And on the morrow early he went forth, avowedly to become a layman again.


Now at the first break of day, as he was surveying the world, the Teacher became aware of this; and going forth even earlier than Cullapanthaka, he paced to and fro by the porch on Cullapanthakaâs road. As the latter came out of the house, he observed the Teacher, and with a salutation went up to him. âWhither away at this hour, Cullapanthaka?â said the Teacher.


âMy brother has expelled me from the Saá¹gha, sir; and I am going to wander forth.â


âCullapanthaka, as it was under me that you took the vows, why did you not, when expelled by your brother, come to me? Come, what have you to do with a laymanâs life? You shall stay with me.â So saying, he took Cullapanthaka and seated him at the door of his own perfumed chamber. Then giving him a perfectly clean cloth which he had made by his Supernormal Powers, the Teacher said: âFace towards the east, and as you handle this cloth, repeat these words â âRemoval of Impurity; Removal of Impurity.â â Then at the time appointed the Teacher, attended by the Saá¹gha, went to JÄ«vakaâs house and sat down on the seat set for him.
 [1.17]


Now Cullapanthaka, with his gaze fixed on the sun, sat handling the cloth and repeating the words, âRemoval of Impurity; Removal of Impurity.â And as he kept handling the piece of cloth, it grew soiled. Then he thought: âJust now this piece of cloth was quite clean; but I have destroyed its original state and made it dirty. Impermanent indeed are all compounded things! And even as he realised Death and Decay, he won the Arahatâs Awakening. Knowing that Cullapanthakaâs mind had won Awakening, the Teacher sent forth an apparition and in this semblance of himself appeared before him, as if seated in front of him and saying: âHeed it not, Cullapanthaka, that this mere piece of cloth has become dirty and stained with impurity; within you are the impurities of lust and other evil things. Remove them.â And the apparition uttered these verses:

âImpurity in lust consists, not dirt;

And lust we term the real impurity.

Yea, monks, whoso drives it from his breast,

They live in the stainless dispensation. 
{1.118}


Impurity in wrath consists, not dirt;

And wrath we term the real impurity.

Yea, monks, whoso drives it from his breast,

They live in the stainless dispensation.


Delusion is impurity, not dirt;

We term delusion real impurity.

Yea, monks, whoso drives it from his breast,

They live in the stainless dispensation.â 
[These verses seem to be first quoted in the 
MahÄniddesa
 and 
Cullaniddesa
, and then frequently throughout the commentarial system.]

At the close of these verses Cullapanthaka attained to Arahatship with the four analytic knowledges, 
These four branches were (i) understanding of the sense of the sacred books, (ii) understanding of their ethical truth, (iii) ability to justify an interpretation grammatically, logically & so on, and (iv) the power of public exposition.
 whereby he straightaway came to have analytic knowledge of all the sacred texts.


Tradition has it that, in ages past, when he was a king and was making a solemn procession round his city, he wiped the sweat from his brow with a spotless cloth which he was wearing; and the cloth was stained. He thought: âIt is this body of mine which has destroyed the original purity and whiteness of the cloth, and dirtied it. Impermanent indeed are all composite things.â Thus he grasped the idea of impermanence; and hence it came to pass that it was the removal of impurity which worked his emancipation.


Meantime, JÄ«vaka KomÄrabhacca offered the Water of Donation; 
When a gift was made, the donor poured water over the hand of the donee. The gift that was here made by JÄ«vaka was the food bestowed on the monastics, as the 
MilindapaÃ±ha
 explains (p. 118) in its version of this story.
 but the One with Ten Powers put his hand over the vessel, saying: âAre there no monks, JÄ«vaka, in the monastery?â


Said MahÄpanthaka, âThere are no monks there, venerable sir.â âOh yes, there are, JÄ«vaka,â said the Teacher. âHi, there!â said JÄ«vaka to a servant, âjust you go and see whether or not there are any monks in the monastery.â


At that moment Cullapanthaka, conscious as he was that his brother was declaring there were no monks in the monastery, determined to show him there were, and so filled the whole mango-grove with nothing but monks. Some were making robes, others dyeing, while others again were repeating the sacred texts: each of a thousand monks he made unlike all the others. Finding this host of monks in the monastery, the man returned and said that the whole mango-grove was full of monks.


But as regards the elder up in the monastery â

âPanthaka, a thousand-fold self-multiplied,

Sat on, till bidden, in that pleasant grove.â 
[1.18]

âNow go back,â said the Teacher to the man, âand say âThe Teacher sends for him whose name is Cullapanthaka.â â


But when the man went and delivered his message, a thousand mouths answered, âI am Cullapanthaka! I am Cullapanthaka!â


Back came the man with the report, âThey all say they are âCullapanthaka,â venerable sir.â


âWell now go back,â said the Teacher, âand take by the hand the first one of them who says he is Cullapanthaka, 
{1.119}
 and the others will all vanish.â The man did as he was bidden, and straightaway the thousand monks vanished from sight. The elder came back with the man.


When the meal was over, the Teacher said: âJÄ«vaka, take Cullapanthakaâs bowl; he will return thanks.â JÄ«vaka did so. Then like a young lion roaring defiance, the elder ranged over the whole of the sacred texts through in his address of thanks. Lastly, the Teacher rose from his seat and attended by the Saá¹gha returned to the monastery, and there, after the assignment of tasks by the Saá¹gha, he rose from his seat and, standing in the doorway of his perfumed chamber, delivered a Sugataâs discourse to the Saá¹gha. Ending with a theme which he gave out for meditation, and dismissing the Saá¹gha, he retired into his perfumed chamber, and lay down lion-like on his right side to rest.


At evening, the orange-robed monks assembled together from all sides in the Dhamma Hall and sang the Teacherâs praises, even as though they were spreading a curtain of orange cloth round him as they sat.


âMonks,â it was said: âMahÄpanthaka failed to recognise the bent of Cullapanthaka, and expelled him from the monastery as a dullard who could not even learn a single verse in four whole months. But the All-Knowing Buddha by his supremacy in the Dhamma bestowed on him Arahatship with all its supernatural knowledge, even while a single meal was in progress. And by that knowledge he grasped the whole of the sacred texts. Oh! How great is a Buddhaâs power!â


Now the Fortunate One, knowing full well the talk that was going on in the Dhamma Hall, thought it good to go there. So, rising from his Buddha-couch, he donned his two orange robes, girded himself as with lightning, arrayed himself in his upper robe, the ample robe of a Buddha, and came forth to the Dhamma Hall with the infinite grace of a Buddha, moving with the royal gait of an elephant in the plenitude of his vigour. Ascending the glorious Buddha-throne set in the midst of the resplendent hall, he seated himself upon the middle of the throne emitting those six-coloured rays which mark a Buddha â like the newly-arisen sun, when from the peaks of the Yugandhara Mountains he illumines the depths of the ocean. Immediately the Buddha came into the Hall, the Saá¹gha broke off their talk and were silent. Gazing round on the company with gentle loving-kindness, the Teacher thought within himself, âThis company is perfect! Not a man is guilty of moving a hand or foot improperly; not a sound, not a cough or sneeze is to he heard! In their reverence and awe of the majesty and glory of the Buddha, not a man would dare to speak before I did, even if I sat here in silence all my life long. But it is my part to begin; and I will open the conversation.â Then in his sweet divine tones he addressed the monks and said, 
{1.120}
 âWhat, pray, is theme of this conclave? And what was the talk which was broken off?â


âSir,â they said, âit was no profitless theme, but your own praises that we were telling here in a meeting.â


And when they had told him word for word what they had been saying, the Teacher said: âMonks, through me Cullapanthaka has just now risen to great things in the Dhamma; in times past it was to great things in the way of wealth that he rose â but equally through me.â


The monks asked the Teacher to explain this; and the Fortunate One made clear in these words a thing which succeeding existences had hidden from them: 
[1.19]

His lesson ended, the Supreme Buddha, after Fully Awakening, repeated this verse:

Even with little, an intelligent, skilled person, by means of an offering, raises himself up, like a small fire that has been fanned, is raised up.

Also the Fortunate One said: âIt is through me, monks, that Cullapanthaka has just now risen to great things in the Faith, as in times past to great things in the way of wealth.â His lesson thus finished, the Teacher made the connection between the two stories he had told and identified the JÄtaka in these concluding words, âCullapanthaka was in those days the pupil of Cullakaseá¹­á¹­hi, and I myself the Lord High Treasurer.â

âWhat value does a measure of rice have?â
 
[1.21]
 This was told by the Teacher, while at Jetavana, about the elder UdÄyi, called the Dullard.


At that time the venerable Dabba, the Mallian, was steward to the Saá¹gha. 
See 
Vinaya
, Vol. iii. p. 158.
 When in the early morning Dabba was allotting the checks for rice, sometimes it was choice rice and sometimes it was an inferior quality which fell to the share of the elder UdÄyi. On days when he received the inferior quality, he used to make a commotion in the check-room, by demanding, âIs Dabba the only one who knows how to give out checks? Donât we know?â One day when he was making a commotion, they handed him the check-basket, saying: âHere! You give the checks out yourself today!â Thenceforth, it was UdÄyi who gave out the checks to the Saá¹gha. But, in his distribution, he could not tell the best from the inferior rice; nor did he know what seniority

 was entitled to the best rice and what to the inferior. So too, when he was making out the roster, he had not an idea of the seniority of the monks thereon. Consequently, when the monks took up their places, he made a mark on the ground or on the wall to show that one detachment stood here, and another there. Next day there were fewer monks of one grade and more of another in the check-room; where there were fewer, the mark was too low down; where the number was greater, it was too high up. But UdÄyi, quite ignorant of detachments, gave out the checks simply according to his old marks.


Hence, the monks said to him, âFriend UdÄyi, the mark is too high up or too low down; the best rice is for those of such and such a seniority, and the inferior quality for such and such others.â But he put them back with the argument, âIf this mark is where it is, what are you standing here for? Why am I to trust you? Itâs my mark I trust.â


Then, the boys and novices 
{1.124}
 thrust him from the check-room, crying, âFriend UdÄyi the Dullard, when you give out the checks, the monks are docked of what they ought to get; youâre not fit to give them out; get you gone from here.â Hereupon, a great uproar arose in the check-room.


Hearing the noise, the Teacher asked the elder Änanda, saying: âÄnanda, there is a great uproar in the check-room. What is the noise about?â


The elder explained it all to the TathÄgata. âÄnanda,â said he, âthis is not the only time when UdÄyi by his stupidity has robbed others of their profit; he did just the same thing in bygone times too.â


The elder asked the Fortunate One for an explanation, and the Fortunate One made clear what had been concealed by rebirth.

What value does a measure of rice have? Do you speak of the price of horses, king? Benares, on the inside and outside, he values it at a measure of rice!

His lesson ended and the two stories told, the Teacher made the connection linking both together, and identified the JÄtaka by saying in conclusion, âUdÄyi the Dullard was the stupid rustic valuer of those days, and I myself the wise valuer.â

## Full Story
âEndowed with conscience and concern.â
 This story was told by the Fortunate One while at Jetavana, about a wealthy monk.


Tradition tells us that, on the death of his wife, a householder of SÄvatthi joined the Saá¹gha. When he was joining, he caused to be built for himself a chamber to live in, a room for the fire, and a store-room; and not till he had stocked his store-room with ghee, rice, and the like, did he finally join. Even after he had become a monk, he used to send for his servants and make them cook him what he liked to eat. He was richly provided with the requisites, 
i.e. an alms-bowl, three cloths, a girdle, a razor, a needle and a water-strainer.
 having an entire change of clothing for night and another for day; and he dwelt aloof on the outskirts of the monastery.
 [1.24]


One day when he had taken out his cloths and bedding and had spread them out to dry in his chamber, a number of monks from the country, who were on a pilgrimage from monastery to monastery, 
I take this to be the meaning of 
senÄsanacÄrikÄ
, in contradistinction to the ordinary 
cÄrikÄ
 in which the destination was uncertain and in which alms were received from the laity.
 came in their journeying to his cell and found all these belongings.


âWhose are these?â they asked. âMine, sirs,â he replied. âWhat, sir?â they cried, âthis upper-cloth and that as well; this under-robe as well as that; and that bedding too, is it all yours?â âYes, nobodyâs but mine.â âSir,â they said, âthe Fortunate One has only sanctioned three cloths; and yet, though the Buddha, to whose dispensation you have devoted yourself, is so simple in his wants, you forsooth have amassed all this stock of requisites. Come! We must take you before the One with Ten Powers.â And, so saying, they went off with him to the Teacher.


Becoming aware of their presence, the Teacher said, 
{1.127}
 âWherefore is it, monks, that you have brought this monk against his will?â âSir, this monk is well-off and has quite a stock of requisites.â âIs it true, monk, as they say, that you are so well-off?â âYes, Fortunate One.â âBut why, monk, have you amassed these belongings? Do not I extol the virtues of wanting little, contentment, and so forth, solitude, and determined resolve?â


Angered by the Teacherâs words, he cried, âThen Iâll go about like this!â And, flinging off his outer clothing, he stood in their midst clad only in his waist-cloth.


Then, as a moral support to him, the Teacher said: âWas it not you, monk, who in bygone days were a seeker after the shamefacedness that fears wrong, and even when you were a Water Rakkhasa lived for twelve years seeking after that shamefacedness? How then comes it that, after vowing to follow the weighty dispensation of the Buddha, you have flung off your outer robes and stand here devoid of shame?â


At the Teacherâs word, his sense of shame was restored; he donned his robes again, and, saluting the Teacher, seated himself at the side.


The monks having asked the Fortunate One to explain to them the matter he had mentioned, the Fortunate One made clear what had been concealed from them by rebirth.

Endowed with conscience and concern, having an unsullied nature, those virtuous and good people in the world are said to have Deva-nature. 
{1.132}

His lesson ended, the Teacher preached the Truths, at the close whereof that monk won the Fruit of the First Path. And the All-knowing Buddha, having told the two stories, made the connection linking the two together, and identified the JÄtaka, by saying: âThe well-to-do monk was the Water Rakkhasa of those days; Änanda was SÅ«riyakumÄra, SÄriputta was CandakumÄra, and I myself the eldest brother, prince Mahiá¹sÄsa.â

âI am your son, great king.â
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana about the story of VÄsabhakhattiyÄ, which will be found in the Twelfth Book in the BhaddasÄlajÄtaka [Ja 465]. Tradition tells us that she was the daughter of MahÄnÄma Sakka by a slave girl named NÄgamuá¹á¸Ä, and that she afterwards became the consort of the king of Kosala. She conceived a son by the king; but the king, coming to know of her servile origin, degraded her from her rank, and also degraded her son Viá¸Å«á¸abha. Mother and son never came outside the palace.


Hearing of this, the Teacher at early dawn came to the palace attended by five hundred monks, 
{1.134}
 and, sitting down on the seat prepared for him, said: âSire, where is VÄsabhakhattiyÄ?â


Then the king told him what had happened.


âSire, whose daughter is VÄsabhakhattiyÄ?â âMahÄnÄmaâs daughter, sir.â âWhen she came away, to whom did she come as wife?â âTo me, sir.â âSire, she is a kingâs daughter; to a king she is wed; and to a king she bore her

The king asked the Fortunate One to explain this. The Fortunate One made clear what had been concealed from him by rebirth.

I am your son, great king, you must support me, leader of men, the king supports others, so why not his own son?

His lesson to the king of Kosala ended, and his two stories told, the Teacher made the connection linking them both together, and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âMahÄmÄyÄ was the mother of those days, king Suddhodana was the father, and I myself king Kaá¹­á¹­havÄhana.â

## Full Story
âBy proceeding steadily.â
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana about a monk who gave up persevering. In this JÄtaka both the Story of the Present and the Story of the Past will be given in the Eleventh Book in connection with the Saá¹varajÄtaka [Ja 462]; 
[In that 
JÄtaka
 the prince is called Saá¹vara. Here I include the story but modify the name to match the hero in this story.]
 the incidents are the same both for that JÄtaka and for this, but the verses are different.

This, we learn, was a young man of family, who lived in SÄvatthi. Having heard the Teacherâs discoursing, he renounced the world. Fulfilling the tasks imposed by his teachers and preceptors, he learned by heart both the PÄtimokkhas. 
[It means the rules for both monks and nuns.]


When five years were past, he said: âWhen I have been instructed in the mode of attaining Absorption, I will go dwell in the forest.â Then he took leave of his teachers and preceptors, and proceeded to a frontier village in the kingdom of Kosala. The people were pleased with his behaviour, and he made a hut of leaves and there was attended to.


Entering upon the rainy season, zealous, eager, striving in strenuous endeavour he strove after Absorption for the space of three months: but of this not a trace could he produce. Then he thought: âVerily I am the most devoted to worldly conditions among the four classes of men taught by the Teacher! What have I to do with living in the forest?â Then he said to himself, âI will return to Jetavana, and there in beholding the beauty of the TathÄgata, and hearing his discourse sweet as honey, I will pass my days.â So he relaxed his striving; and setting forth he came in course of time to Jetavana. His preceptors and teachers, his friends and acquaintances asked him the cause of his coming. He informed them, and they reproved him for it, asking him why he had done so.


Then they led him into the Teacherâs presence. âWhy, monks,â said the Teacher, âdo you lead here a monk against his will?â They replied, âThis monk has come here because he has relaxed his striving.â âIs this true, as they tell me?â asked the Teacher. âYes, sir,â said the man. Said the Teacher, âWhy have you ceased to strive, monk? For a weak and slothful man there is in this dispensation no high fruition, no becoming an Arahat: they only who make strenuous effort accomplish this. In days long gone by you were full of strength, easy to teach: and in this way, though the youngest of all the hundred sons of the king of Benares, by holding fast to the admonition of wise men you obtained the white umbrella.â So saying, he told a story of the past.

By proceeding steadily the one who desires the fruit succeeds, I have the fruit of the spiritual life, know this, GÄmaá¹i. 
{1.137}

His lesson ended, the Teacher preached the Truths, at the close whereof the faint-hearted monk became an Arahat. Having told the two stories, the Teacher showed the connection linking them both together and identified the JÄtaka.

## Full Story
âThese greying hairs growing on my head.â
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana about the Great Renunciation, which has already been related in the NidÄnakathÄ. 
See p. 61 et seq. of Vol. i. of FausbÃ¶llâs text for this account of how Prince Siddhattha, the future Buddha, renounced the world for the Truth. [NidÄnakathÄ p. 61-65. I give an abbreviated version of it here.]

...the future Buddha, making light of the kingdom of the world, thus within his reach â casting it away as one would saliva â left the city with great honour on the full-moon day of ÄsÄá¸·ha, when the moon was in the UttarÄsÄá¸·ha lunar mansion (i.e. on the Full Moon day in July)...


For then, they say, Devas in front of him carried sixty thousand torches, and behind him too, and on his right hand, and on his left...


Advancing in this pomp and glory, the Bodhisatta, in that one night, passed beyond three kingdoms, and arrived, at the end of thirty leagues, at the bank of the river called AnomÄ...


Now the Bodhisatta, stopping at the river side, asked Channa, âWhat is this river called?â


âIts name, my lord, is AnomÄ.â


âAnd so also our renunciation of the world shall be called AnomÄ (Illustrious),â said he; and signalling to his horse, by pressing it with his heel, the horse sprang over the river, five or six hundred yards in breadth, and stood on the opposite bank.


The Bodhisatta, getting down from the horseâs back, stood on the sandy beach, extending there like a sheet of silver, and said to Channa, âGood Channa, do you now go back, taking my ornaments and Kanthaka. I am going to become an ascetic.â


âBut I also, my lord, will become an ascetic.â


âYou cannot be allowed to renounce the world, you must go back,â he said. Three times he refused this request of Channaâs; and he delivered over to him both the ornaments and Kanthaka.


Then he thought: âThese locks of mine are not suited for a mendicant. Now it is not right for any one else to cut the hair of a future Buddha, so I will cut them off myself with my sword.â Then, taking his sword in his right hand, and holding the plaited tresses, together with the diadem on them, with his left, he cut them off. So his hair was thus reduced to two inches in length, and curling from the right, it lay close to his head. It remained that length as long as he lived, and the beard the same. There was no need at all to shave either hair or beard any more.


The Bodhisatta, saying to himself, âIf I am to become a Buddha, let it stand in the air; if not, let it fall to the ground;â threw the hair and diadem together as he held them towards the sky...


Again the Bodhisatta thought: âThis my raiment of Benares muslin is not suitable for a mendicant.â Now the Deva Ghaá¹­ikÄra, who had formerly been his friend in the time of Kassapa, the One with Ten Powers, was led by his friendship, which had not grown old in that long interval, to think, âToday my friend is accomplishing the Great Renunciation, I will go and provide him with the requisites of a mendicant.â

273. âThe three robes, and the alms bowl,

Razor, needle, and girdle,

And a water strainer â these eight

Are the wealth of the monk devout.â

Taking these eight requisites of a mendicant, he gave them to him. The Bodhisatta dressed himself in the outward signs of an Arahat, and adopted the sacred garb of Renunciation; and he enjoined upon Channa to go and, in his name, assure his parents of his safety. And Channa did homage to the Bodhisatta reverently, and departed.

On this occasion the monks sat praising the Renunciation of the One with Ten Powers. Entering the Dhamma Hall and seating himself on the Buddha-seat, the Teacher thus addressed the monks, âWhat is your theme, monks, as you sit here in a meeting?â âIt is naught else, sir, than the praise of your own Renunciation.â âMonks,â rejoined the Teacher, ânot only in these latter days has the TathÄgata

 made a Renunciation; in bygone days too he similarly renounced the world.â The monks asked the Fortunate One for an explanation of this. The Fortunate One made clear what had been concealed from them by rebirth.
 [1.31]

These greying hairs growing on my head carry off my youthful life, divine messengers manifest, it is time for me to go forth. 
{1.139}

After repeating his statement that he had similarly renounced the world in bygone days, the Teacher at the end of his lesson preached the Four Truths. Some entered the First Path, some the Second, and some the Third. Having told the two stories, the Teacher showed the connection between them and identified the JÄtaka, by saying: âIn those days Änanda was the barber, RÄhula the son, and I myself king MakhÄdeva.â

 {1.140}
 This story was told by the Teacher while in the AnÅ«piya Mango-grove near the town of AnÅ«piya, about the elder Bhaddiya (the Happy), who joined the Saá¹gha in the company of the six young nobles with whom was UpÄli. 
cf. Oldenbergâs 
Vinaya
, Vol. ii, pp. 180-4 (translated at p. 232 of Vol. xx. of the 
Sacred Books of the East
), for an account of the conversion of the six SÄkyan princes and the barber UpÄli.
 Of these the elders Bhaddiya, Kimbila, Bhagu, and UpÄli attained to Arahatship; the elder Änanda entered the First Path; the elder Anuruddha gained all-seeing vision; and Devadatta obtained the power of Absorption. The story of the six young nobles, up to the events at AnÅ«piya, will be related in the Khaá¹á¸ahÄlajÄtaka [Ja 542].


The venerable Bhaddiya, who used in the days of his royalty to guard himself as though he were appointed his own tutelary deity, bethought him of the state of fear in which he then lived when he was being guarded by numerous guards and when he used to toss about even on his royal couch in his private apartments high up in the palace; and with this he compared the absence of fear in which, now that he was an Arahat, he roamed here and there in forests and desert places. And at the thought he burst into this exalted utterance, âOh, happiness! Oh, happiness!â
 [1.33]


This the monks reported to the Fortunate One, saying: âThe venerable Bhaddiya is declaring the bliss he has won.â


âMonks,â said the Fortunate One, âthis is not the first time that Bhaddiyaâs life has been happy; his life was no less happy in bygone days.â


The monks asked the Fortunate One to explain this. The Fortunate One made clear what had been concealed from them by rebirth.

He who others do not guard, also he who does not guard others, lives easily, king, not having desire for sensual pleasures. 
{1.142}

His lesson ended, and the two stories told, the Teacher showed the connection linking them both together, and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThe elder Bhaddiya was the disciple of those days, and I myself the teacher of the company of ascetics.â

## Full Story
âThe virtuous one will prosper.â
 This story was told by the Teacher in the Bamboo Grove near RÄjagaha about Devadatta. The story of Devadatta 
See 
Cullavagga
, vii. 1 â 
et seq
. The âFive Pointsâ of Devadatta are there given (vii. 3. 14) as follows: âThe monks shall live all their life long in the forest, subsist solely on doles collected out of doors, dress solely in rags picked out of dust-heaps, dwell under trees and never under a roof, never eat fish or flesh.â These five points were all more rigid in their asceticism than the Buddhaâs rule, and were formulated by Devadatta in order to outbid his cousin and master.
 will be related, up to the date of the employment of assassins, in the Khaá¹á¸ahÄlajÄtaka [Ja 542]; up to the date of his dismissal from the office of Treasurer, in the Cullahaá¹sajÄtaka [Ja 533]; and, up to the date of his being swallowed up by the earth, in the Sixteenth Book in the SamuddavÄá¹ijajÄtaka [Ja 466].


For, on the occasion now in question, Devadatta, through failing to carry the Five Points which he had pressed for, had made a schism in the Saá¹gha and had gone off with five hundred monks to dwell at GayÄsÄ«sa. Now, these monks came to a riper knowledge; and the Teacher, knowing this, called the 
[1.35]
 two chief disciples 
The two chief disciples, of whom only one is named in the text, were SÄriputta (surnamed âthe Captain of the Dhammaâ) and MoggallÄna, two brahmin friends, originally followers of a wandering ascetic, whose conversion to Buddhism is related in the 
MahÄvagga
, i. 23. Unlike this 
JÄtaka
, the 
Vinaya
 account (
Cullavagga
, vii. 4) of the re-conversion of the backsliders gives a share of the credit to MoggallÄna.
 and said: âSÄriputta, your five hundred pupils who were perverted by Devadattaâs teaching and went off with him, have now come to a riper knowledge. Go there with a number of the monks, preach the Dhamma to them, enlighten these wanderers respecting the Paths and the Fruits, and bring them back with you.â


They went there, preached the Dhamma, enlightened them respecting the Paths and the Fruits, and next day 
{1.143}
 at dawn came back again with those monks to the Bamboo Grove. And while SÄriputta was standing there after saluting the Fortunate One on his return, the monks spoke thus to him in praise of the elder SÄriputta, âSir, very bright was the glory of our elder brother, the Captain of the Dhamma, as he returned with a following of five hundred monks; whereas Devadatta has lost all his following.â


âThis is not the only time, monks, when glory has been SÄriputtaâs on his return with a following of his kinsfolk; like glory was his too in bygone days. So too this is not the only time when Devadatta has lost his following; he lost it also in bygone days.â


The monks asked the Fortunate One to explain this to them. The Fortunate One made clear what had been concealed by rebirth.

The virtuous one will prosper, he whose way of life is friendly, look at Lakkhaá¹a approaching, surrounded by his relatives, then look at this KÄá¸·a, who has completely lost his relatives. 
{1.145}

At the close of his lesson, when the Teacher had repeated that SÄriputtaâs glory and Devadattaâs loss had both had a parallel in bygone days, he showed the connection linking the two stories together and identified the JÄtaka, by saying: âDevadatta was the KÄá¸·a of those days; his followers were KÄá¸·aâs following; SÄriputta was the Lakkhaá¹a of those days, and his following the Buddhaâs followers; RÄhulaâs mother was the mother of those days; and I myself was the father.â

## Analysis
In the present the Buddha defends a nun who was found to be pregnant as it happened before her ordination. She later has a child, who becomes a famous monk in the dispensation. The Buddha then tells a story of two herds of deer in previous times, and how the king of one condemned a pregnant doe to die for the kingâs lunch; while the other king, he stepped in to take her place. The king of Benares, impressed with his compassion, decided to free all animals in his kingdom.

## Full Story
âAssociate with Nigrodha.â
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana about the mother of the elder named prince Kassapa. The daughter, we learn, of a wealthy merchant of RÄjagaha was deeply rooted in goodness and scorned all temporal things; she had reached her final existence, and within her breast, like a lamp in a pitcher, glowed her sure hope of winning 
[1.37]
 Arahatship. As soon as she reached knowledge of herself, she took no joy in a worldly life but yearned to renounce the world. With this aim, she said to her mother and father, âMy dear parents, my heart takes no joy in a worldly life; fain would I embrace the dispensation which leads to safety of the Buddha. Allow me to take the vows.â


âWhat, my dear? Ours is a very wealthy family, and you are our only daughter. You cannot take the vows.â


Having failed to win her parentsâ consent, though she asked them again and again, she thought to herself, âBe it so then; when I am married into another family, I will gain my husbandâs consent and take the vows.â And when, being grown up, she entered another family, she proved a devoted wife and lived a life of goodness and virtue 
Or, perhaps, âwas beautiful.â
 in her new home. Now it came to pass that she conceived, though she knew it not.


There was a festival proclaimed in that city, 
{1.146}
 and everybody kept holiday, the city being decked like a city of the gods. But she, even at the height of the festival, neither anointed herself nor put on any finery, going about in her every-day attire. So her husband said to her, âMy dear wife, everybody is holiday-making; but you do not put on your finery.â


âMy lord and master,â she replied, âthe body is filled with two-and-thirty component parts. Wherefore should it be adorned? This bodily frame is not fashioned after a Deva or a Brahma; it is not made of gold, jewels, or yellow sandalwood; it takes not its birth from the womb of lotus-flowers, white or red or blue; it is not filled with any immortal balsam. Nay, it is bred of corruption, and born of mortal parents; the qualities that mark it are the wearing and wasting away, the decay and destruction of the merely transient; it is fated to swell a graveyard, and is devoted to sensual desires; it is the source of sorrow, and the occasion of lamentation; it is the abode of all diseases, and the repository of the workings of Karma. Foul within â it is always excreting. Yea, as all the world can see, its end is death, passing to the charnel-house, there to be the dwelling-place of worms.

Connected by bones and sinews, smeared with skin and flesh, the body is covered with the tegument, it is not seen for what it really is.


Filled with intestines, filled with stomach, having liver, bladder, heart, lungs, kidneys, and spleen, mucus, saliva, sweat and fat, blood, sinovial fluid, bile and sweat.


Furthermore, from the nine openings flow excrements on all sides, eye-excrement from the eyes, ear-excrement from the ears, mucus from the nose, and sometimes one vomits from the mouth, one throws up bile and phlegm, from the body flow sweat and dirt.


Furthermore, the hollow of the head is filled with the brain. The fool regards this as beautiful, being surrounded by ignorance (Snp. 196-201).


There is endless danger in the body, it is like a poisonous tree, the abode of all illnesses, a complete heap of suffering (Tha-ap. 55).


If from this body the inside would be exposed, one would need to take a stick to ward off the crows and dogs.


The impure body smells bad, like a cesspit, a toilet, the body, that fools take delight in, is condemned by those having insight.


Covered with moist flesh, having nine openings, a great wound, it flows with stinking excrements on all sides (Vsm. 1.122).
 {1.147}

What should I achieve, my bridegroom, by tricking out this body? Would not its adornment be like decorating the outside of a bed pan?â


âMy dear wife,â rejoined the young merchant, âif you regard this body as so sinful, why donât you become a nun?â


âIf I am accepted, my husband, I will take the vows this very day.â âVery good,â said he, âI will get you admitted to the Saá¹gha.â And after he had shown lavish bounty and hospitality to the Saá¹gha, he escorted her with a large following to the nunnery and had her admitted a nun â but of the following of Devadatta. Great was her joy at the fulfilment of her desire to become a nun.


As her time drew near, the nuns, noticing the change in her person, the swelling in her hands and feet and her increased size, said: âLady, you seem about to become a mother; what does it mean?â


âI cannot tell, ladies; I only know I have led a virtuous life.â


So the nuns brought her before Devadatta, saying: âLord, this young gentle-woman, who was admitted a nun with the reluctant consent of her husband, has now proved to be with child; but whether this dates from before her admission to the Saá¹gha or not, we cannot say. What are we to do now?â


Not being a Buddha, and not having any patience, loving-kindness or sympathy, Devadatta thought thus, âIt will be a damaging report to get abroad that one of my nuns is with child, and that I condone the offence. My course is clear â I must expel this woman from the Saá¹gha.â Without any enquiry, starting forward as if to thrust aside a mass of stone, he said: âAway, and expel this woman!â


Receiving this answer, they arose and with reverent salutation withdrew to their own nunnery. But the girl said to those nuns, âLadies, Devadatta the elder is not the Buddha. My vows were taken not under Devadatta, but under 
[1.38]
 the Buddha, the foremost in the world. Rob me not of the vocation I won so hardly; but take me before the Teacher at Jetavana.â So they set out with her for Jetavana, and journeying over the forty-five leagues there from RÄjagaha, came in due course to their destination, where with reverent salutation to the Teacher, they laid the matter before him.


Thought the Teacher, âAlbeit the child was conceived while she was still of the laity, yet it will give the heretics an occasion to say that the ascetic Gotama 
{1.148}
 has taken a nun expelled by Devadatta. Therefore, to cut short such talk, this case must be heard in the presence of the king and his court.â So on the morrow he sent for Pasenadi king of Kosala, the elder and the younger AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika, the lady VisÄkhÄ the great lay-disciple, and other well-known personages; and in the evening when the four classes of the faithful were all assembled â monks, nuns, and lay-disciples, both male and female â he said to the elder UpÄli, âGo, and clear up this matter of the young nun in the presence of the four classes of my disciples.â


âIt shall be done, venerable sir,â said the elder, and forth to the assembly he went and there, seating himself in his place, he called up VisÄkhÄ the lay-disciple in sight of the king, and placed the conduct of the enquiry in her hands, saying: âFirst ascertain the precise day of the precise month on which this girl joined the Saá¹gha, VisÄkhÄ; and thence compute whether she conceived before or since that date.â Accordingly the lady had a curtain put up as a screen, behind which she retired with the girl. Looking at the hands, the feet, the navel, at the very belly of the damsel 
[For reasons I do not understand this sentence was printed in Latin in the original: 
Spectatis manibus, pedibus, umbilico, ipso ventre puellÃ¦
.]
 the lady found, on comparing the days and months, that the conception had taken place before the girl had become a nun. This she reported to the elder, who proclaimed the nun innocent before all the assembly. And she, now that her innocence was established, reverently saluted the Saá¹gha and the Teacher, and with the nuns returned to her own nunnery.


When her time was come, she bore the son strong in spirit, for whom she had prayed at the feet of the Buddha Padumuttara ages ago. One day, when the king was passing by the nunnery, he heard the cry of an infant and asked his courtiers what it meant. They, knowing the facts, told his majesty that the cry came from the child to which the young nun had given birth. âSirs,â said the king, âthe care of children is a clog on nuns in their ascetic life; let us take charge of him.â So the infant was handed over by the kingâs command to the ladies of his family, and brought up as a prince. When the day came for him to be named, he was called Kassapa, but was known as prince Kassapa [KassapakumÄra] because he was brought up like a prince.


At the age of seven he was admitted a novice under the Teacher, and a full monk when he was old enough. As time went on, he waxed famous among the expounders of the Dhamma. So the Teacher gave him precedence, saying: âMonks, the first in eloquence among my disciples is prince Kassapa.â Afterwards, by virtue of the VammÄ«kasutta, 
[MN 23.]
 he became an Arahat. So too his mother, the nun, grew to clear insight and won the Supreme Fruit. Prince Kassapa the elder shone in the dispensation of the Buddha 
{1.149}
 even as the full-moon in the mid-heaven.


Now one day in the afternoon when the TathÄgata on return from his alms-round had addressed the monks, he passed into his perfumed chamber. At the close of his address the monks spent the daytime either in their night-quarters or in their day-quarters till it was evening, when they assembled in the Dhamma Hall and spoke as follows, âMonks, Devadatta, because he was not a Buddha and because he had no patience, loving-kindness or sympathy, was nigh being the ruin of the elder prince Kassapa and his venerable mother. But the Supreme Buddha, being the Lord of Dhamma and being perfect in patience, loving-kindness and sympathy, has provided their foundation.â And as they sat there telling the praises of the Buddha, he entered the hall with all the grace of a Buddha, and asked, as he took his seat, what they were talking of as they sat together. âOf your own virtues, sir,â they said, and told him all.
 [1.39]


âThis is not the first time, monks,â said he, âthat the TathÄgata has proved to be a foundation and refuge of these two: he was the same to them in the past also.â


Then, on the monks asking him to explain this to them, he revealed what rebirth had hidden from them.

Associate with Nigrodha, associate not with SÄkha, better is death with Nigrodha, than is having life with SÄkha.

At the close of this lesson, when the Teacher had repeated that, as now, so in bygone days also he had been the support of the pair, he preached the Four Truths. He then showed the connection, linking together the two stories he had told, and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âDevadatta was the deer called SÄkha of 
[1.42]
 those days, and his followers were that deerâs herd; the nun was the doe, and prince Kassapa was her offspring; Änanda was the king; and I myself was the deer king Nigrodha.â

## Full Story
âCursed be the dart, the barb.â
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana about the temptation caused to monks by the wives of their mundane life. This will be related in the IndriyajÄtaka [Ja 423] in the Eighth Book.

The story is that a young man of good family at SÄvatthi heard the Teacherâs preaching, and thinking it impossible to lead a holy life, perfectly complete and pure, as a householder, he determined to become an ascetic in the dispensation which leads to safety and so make an end of misery. So he gave up his house and property to his wife and children, and asked the Teacher to ordain him. The Teacher did so. As he was the junior in his going about for alms with his teachers and instructors, and as the monks were many, he got no chair either in laymenâs houses or in the refectory, but only a stool or a bench at the end of the novices, his food was tossed him hastily on a ladle, he got gruel made of broken lumps of rice, solid food stale or decaying, or sprouts dried and burnt; and this was not enough to keep him alive. He took what he had got to the wife he had left: she took his bowl, saluted him, emptied it and gave him instead well-cooked gruel and rice with sauce and curry.


The monk was captivated by the love of such flavours and could not leave his wife. She thought she would test his affection. One day she had a countryman cleansed with white clay and set down in her house with some others of his people whom she had sent for, and she gave them something to eat and drink. They sat eating and enjoying it. At the house-door she had some bullocks bound to wheels and a cart set ready. She herself sat in a back room cooking cakes. Her husband came and stood at the door. Seeing him, one old servant told his mistress that there was an elder at the door. âSalute him and bid him pass on.â


But though he did so repeatedly, he saw the monk remaining there and told his mistress. She came, and lifting up the curtain to see, she cried, âThis is the father of my sons.â She came out and saluted him: taking his bowl and making him enter she gave him food: when he had eaten she saluted again and said: âSir, you are a saint now: we have been staying in this house all this time; but there can be no proper householderâs life without a master, so we will take another house and go far into the country: be zealous in your good works, and forgive me if I am doing wrong.â For a time her husband was as if his heart would break. Then he said: âI cannot leave you, do not go, I will come back to my worldly life; send a laymanâs garment to such and such a place, I will give up my bowl and robes and come back to you.â She agreed. The monk went to his monastery, and giving up his bowl and robes to his teachers and instructors he explained, in answer to their questions, that he could not leave his wife and was going back to worldly life.






Said the Fortunate One to the monk, âMonk, it was because of this very woman that in bygone days you met your death and were roasted over glowing embers.â The monks asked the Fortunate One to explain this. The Fortunate One made clear what had been concealed from them by rebirth.

(Henceforth we shall omit the words respecting the monkâs request for an explanation and the making clear what had been concealed by rebirth; and we shall only say, âTold this story of the past.â When only this is said, all the rest is to be supplied and repeated as above â the request, the simile of setting free the moon from the clouds, and the making clear what had been concealed by rebirth.)



Cursed be the dart, the barb, that strongly pierces into a person, cursed be the country where women are the advisors of the king, blameable are those beings who come under the sway of women.

His lesson ended, the Teacher preached the Four Truths, at the close whereof the love-sick monk was established in the Fruit of the First Path. Having told the two stories, the Teacher showed the connection linking the two together, and identified the JÄtaka.


(Henceforward, we shall omit the words âHaving told the two stories,â and simply say âshowed the connection...â the words omitted are to be supplied as before.)


âIn those days,â said the Teacher, âthe love-sick monk was the mountain-stag; his mundane wife was the young doe, and I was myself the DevatÄ who preached the Dhamma showing the defilement of passion.â

âIt seems that there is nothing worse than tastes.â
 
[1.44]
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about the elder Tissa, called Cullapiá¹á¸apÄtika [the younger alms gatherer]. Tradition says that, while the Teacher was dwelling at the Bamboo Grove near RÄjagaha, the scion of a wealthy house, prince Tissa by name, coming one day to the Bamboo Grove and there hearing a discourse from the Teacher, wished to join the Saá¹gha, but, being refused because his parents would not give their consent, obtained their consent by following Raá¹­á¹­hapÄlaâs 
See 
Raá¹­á¹­hapÄlasutta

R.A.S. Journal
, 1847. See also

 example and refusing food for seven days, and finally took the vows with the Teacher.


About a fortnight after admitting this young man, the Teacher went from the Bamboo Grove to Jetavana, where the young nobleman undertook the thirteen ascetic practices 
These are meritorious ascetic practices for quelling the passions, of which the third is an undertaking to eat no food except alms received direct from the giver in the monkâs alms-bowl. Hence âticket-foodâ (see 
JÄtaka
 No. 5) was also inadmissible.
 and passed his time in going his round for alms from house to house, omitting none. Under the name of the elder Cullapiá¹á¸apÄtika Tissa, he became as bright and shining a light in the Buddhaâs dispensation as the moon in the vault of heaven.


A festival having been proclaimed at this time at RÄjagaha, the elderâs mother and father laid in a silver casket the trinkets he used to wear as a layman, and took it to heart, bewailing thus, âAt other festivals our son used to wear this or that finery as he kept the festival; and he, our only son, has been taken away by the ascetic Gotama to the town of SÄvatthi. Where is our son sitting now or standing?â Now a slave girl who came to the house, noticed the lady of the house weeping, and asked her why she was weeping; and the lady told her all.


âWhat, madam, was your son fond of?â âOf such and such a thing,â replied the lady. âWell, if you will give me authority in this house, Iâll fetch your son back.â âVery good,â said the lady in assent, and gave the girl her expenses and dispatched her with a large following, saying: âGo, and manage to fetch my son back.â


So away the girl rode in a palanquin to SÄvatthi, where she took up her residence in the street which the elder used to frequent for alms. 
{1.157}
 Surrounding herself with servants of her own, and never allowing the elder to see his fatherâs people about, she watched the moment when the elder entered the street and at once bestowed on him an alms of food and drink. And when she had bound him in the bonds of the craving to taste, she got him eventually to seat himself in the house, till she knew that her gifts of food as alms had put him in her power. Then she feigned sickness and lay down in an inner chamber.


In the due course of his round for alms at the proper time, the elder came to the door of her house; and her people took the elderâs bowl and made him sit down in the house.


When he had seated himself, he said: âWhere is the lay-sister?â âSheâs ill, sir; she would be glad to see you.â


Bound as he was by the bonds of the craving to taste, he broke his vow and obligation, and went to where the woman was lying.
 [1.45]


Then she told him the reason of her coming, and so wrought on him that, all because of his being hound by the bonds of the craving to taste, she made him forsake the Saá¹gha; when he was in her power, she put him in the palanquin and came back with a large following to RÄjagaha again. All this was noised abroad.


Sitting in the Dhamma Hall, the monks discussed the matter, saying: âSirs, it is reported that a slave girl has bound in the bonds of the craving of taste, and has carried off, the elder Tissa Cullapiá¹á¸apÄtika.â Entering the Hall the Teacher sat down on his jewelled seat, and said: âWhat, monks, is the subject of discussion in this conclave?â They told him the incident.


âMonks,â said he, âthis is not the first time that, in bondage to the craving of taste, he has fallen into her power; in bygone days too he fell into her power in like manner.â And so saying, he told this story of the past.

It seems that there is nothing worse than tastes, amongst those in homes, or acquaintances. The wind-deer, who depended on his home, was brought under SaÃ±jayaâs control by taste.

When the Teacher had ended his lesson, and had repeated what he had said as to that monkâs having fallen into that womanâs power in bygone days as well as in the present time, he showed the connection and identified the JÄtaka, by saying: âIn those days this slave girl was SaÃ±jaya, Cullapiá¹á¸apÄtika was the wind-antelope, and I myself was the king of Benares.â

âIt is true, Fortunate One,â was the reply.


âSo too in bygone days,â said the Teacher, âyou were unruly and would not heed the admonition of the wise and good â with the result that you were caught in a trap and met your death.â And so saying, he told this story of the past.

## Full Story
âThe deer in three postures.â
 This story was told by the Teacher while dwelling at the Badarika monastery in KosambÄ«, about the elder RÄhula whose heart was set on observing the rules of the Saá¹gha.


Once when the Teacher was dwelling in the AggÄá¸·ava Temple nearby the town of Äá¸·avi, many female lay-disciples and nuns used to flock there to hear the Dhamma preached. The preaching was in the daytime, but as time 
[1.48]
 wore on, the women did not attend, and there were only monks and men disciples present. Then the preaching took place in the evening; and at the close the elder monks retired each to his own chamber. But the younger ones with the lay-disciples lay down to rest in the Attendance Hall. When they fell asleep, loud was the snoring and snorting and gnashing of teeth as they lay. 
{1.161}
 After a short slumber some got up, and reported to the Fortunate One the impropriety which they had witnessed. Said he, âIf a monk sleeps in the company of novices, it is a PÄcittiya offence (requiring confession).â And after delivering this precept he went away to KosambÄ«.


Thereon the monks said to the venerable RÄhula, âSir, the Fortunate One has laid down this precept, and now you will please find quarters of your own.â Now, before this, the monks, out of respect for the father and because of the anxious desire of the son to observe the rules of the Saá¹gha, had welcomed the youth as if the place were his; they had fitted up a little bed for him, and had given him a cloth to make a pillow with. But on the day of our story they would not even give him house-room, so fearful were they of transgressing.


The excellent RÄhula went neither to the One with Ten Powers as being his father, nor to SÄriputta, Captain of the Dhamma, as being his preceptor, nor to the Great MoggallÄna as being his teacher, nor to the elder Änanda as being his uncle; but betook himself to the One with Ten Powersâ outhouse and took up his abode there as though in a heavenly mansion. Now in the One with Ten Powersâ outhouse the door is always closely shut: the levelled floor is of perfumed earth; flowers and garlands are festooned round the walls; and all night long a lamp burns there. But it was not this splendour which prompted RÄhula to take up his residence here. Nay, it was simply because the monks had told him to find quarters for himself, and because he reverenced instruction and yearned to observe the rules of the Saá¹gha. Indeed, from time to time the monks, to test him, when they saw him coming from quite a distance, used to throw down a hand-broom or a little dust-sweepings, and then ask who had thrown it down, after RÄhula had come in. âWell, RÄhula came that way,â would be the remark, but never did the future elder say he knew nothing about it. On the contrary, he used to remove the litter and humbly ask pardon of the monk, nor go away till he was assured that he was pardoned; so anxious was he to observe the rules. And it was solely this anxiety which made him take up his dwelling in the outhouse.


Now, though day had not yet dawned, the Teacher halted at the door of the outhouse and coughed, âAhem.â âAhem,â responded the venerable RÄhula. âWho is there?â said the Buddha. âIt is I, RÄhula,â was the reply; and out came the young man and bowed low. âWhy have you been sleeping here, RÄhula?â âBecause I had nowhere to go to. Up till now, sir, the monks have been very kind to me; but such is their present fear of erring 
{1.162}
 that they wonât give me shelter any more. Consequently, I took up my abode here, because I thought it a spot where I should not come into contact with anybody else.â


Then thought the Teacher to himself, âIf they treat even RÄhula like this, what will they not do to other youths whom they admit to the Saá¹gha?â And his heart was moved within him for the Dhamma. So, at an early hour he had the monks assembled, and questioned the Captain of the Dhamma thus, âI suppose you at all events, SÄriputta, know where RÄhula is now quartered?â


âNo, sir, I do not.â


âSÄriputta, RÄhula was living this day in the outhouse. SÄriputta, if you treat RÄhula like this, what will be your treatment of other youths who go forth in this dispensation? Such treatment will not retain those who join us. In future, keep your novices in your own quarters for a day or two, and only on the third day let them lodge out, taking care to acquaint yourself with their lodging.â With this rider, the Teacher laid down the precept.


Gathering together in the Dhamma Hall, the monks spoke of the goodness of RÄhula. âSee, sirs, how anxious was RÄhula to observe the rules. When told to find his own lodging, he did not say, âI am the son of the One with Ten Powers; what have you to do with quarters? You turn out!â No; not a single monk did he oust, but quartered himself in the outhouse.â
 [1.49]
 As they were talking thus, the Teacher came to the Hall and took his seat on his throne of state, saying: âWhat is the subject of your talk, monks?â âSir,â was the reply, âwe were talking of the anxiety of RÄhula to keep the rules, nothing else.â Then said the Teacher, âThis anxiety RÄhula has shown not only now, but also in the past, when he had been born an animal.â And so saying, he told this story of the past.

The deer in three postures, with many tricks, using eight hoofs, and drinking at midnight, breathing through just one nostril on the ground, my nephew beats the hunter in six ways. 
{1.164}

After repeating what he had said as to RÄhulaâs having shown no less anxiety in time past to keep rules than in the present, the Teacher made the connection and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âRÄhula was the young stag of those days, Uppalavaá¹á¹Ä his mother, and I the stag his uncle.â

âWhether in the dark or bright fortnight.â
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana about two monks who had joined the Saá¹gha in their old age. Tradition says 
{1.165}
 that they were living in a forest-dwelling in the Kosala country, and that one was named the elder KÄá¸·a [Dark] and the other the elder Juá¹ha [Light]. Now one day Juá¹ha said to KÄá¸·a, âSir, at what time does what is called cold appear?â âIt appears in the dark half of the month.â And one day KÄá¸·a said to Juá¹ha, âSir, at what time does what is called cold appear?â âIt appears in the light half of the month.â


As the pair of them together could not solve the question, they went to the Teacher and with due salutation asked, saying: âSir, at what time does what is called cold appear?â


After the Teacher had heard what they had to say, he said: âMonks, in bygone days also, I answered for you this very same question; but your previous existences have become confused in your minds.â 
The compound 
bhavasaá¹khepagatattÄ

 And so saying, he told this story of the past.
 [1.51]

Whether in the dark or bright fortnight, whenever the wind does blow, because the cold is caused by the wind, both are undefeated here.

When the Teacher had ended his lesson in support of what he had said as to his having answered the same question in bygone days, he preached the Four Truths, at the close whereof both of the elders won the Fruit of the First Path. The Teacher showed the connection and identified the JÄtaka, by saying: âKÄá¸·a was the tiger of those days, Juá¹ha the lion, and I myself the ascetic who answered the question.â

 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana about Feasts for the Dead. For at this time the folk were putting to death goats, sheep, and other animals, and offering them up as what is called a Feast for the Dead, for the sake of their departed kinsmen. Finding them thus engaged, the monks asked the Teacher, saying: âJust now, sir, the folk are taking the lives of many living creatures and offering them up as what is called a Feast for the Dead. Can it be, sir, that there is any good in this?â


âNo, monksâ replied the Teacher, ânot even when life is taken with the object of providing a Feast for the Dead, does any good arise therefrom. In bygone days the wise, preaching the Dhamma from mid-air, and showing the evil consequences of the practice, made the whole continent renounce it. But now, when their previous existences have become confused in their minds, the practice has sprung up afresh.â And, so saying, he told this story of the past.

If beings knew thus: this leads to a rebirth full of suffering, no one would kill living beings, for the slayer of beings grieves.

His lesson ended, the Teacher showed the connection, and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âIn those days I was the Tree DevatÄ.â

When the monks became aware of this, they asked the Fortunate One, saying: âCan there be any good in this, sir?â


The Fortunate One told this story of the past.

If you would be released after dying, know that releasing surely binds you, for the wise do not release in this way, such release is only a foolâs bondage.

âMonks,â said the Teacher, âsuch was my ordinance in times gone by.â And, so saying, he told this story of the past.

Seeing footsteps that didnât cross, seeing footsteps that descended, we will drink the water with reeds, but you will surely not kill me.

For once when the monks were gathered together in the Dhamma Hall, they sat talking reproachfully of Devadatta, saying: âSirs, with a view to destroy the TathÄgata, Devadatta hired bowmen, hurled down a rock, and let loose the elephant DhanapÄlaka; in every way he goes about to slay the One with Ten Powers.â 
See

 Entering and seating himself on the seat prepared for him, the Teacher asked, saying: âSirs, what is theme you are discussing here in a meeting?â âSir,â was the reply, âwe were discussing the wickedness of Devadatta, saying that he was always going about to slay you.â Said the Teacher, âIt is not only in these present days, monks, that Devadatta goes about seeking to slay me; he went about with the like intent in bygone days also â but was unable to slay me.â And so saying, he told this story of the past.

For the antelope knows who it is drops fruit from the Sepaá¹á¹i, I will go to another Sepaá¹á¹i, I do not like your fruit.

In the present the Buddha reconciles the king of Kosala to his queen, and then tells this story about a king who condemned all dogs to die for destroying the straps of his carriages. The Bodhisatta, as a leader of the dogs, showed the king that not all dogs were guilty, and thereby earned them a reprieve.


The Bodhisatta = the wise dog (kukkurapaá¹á¸ita),

Änanda = the king (of Benares) (rÄjÄ),

the Buddhaâs disciples = the rest of the cast (avasesÄ parisÄ).

## Full Story
âThose hounds.â
 
 {1.175}
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about acting for the good of kinsfolk, as will be related in the Twelfth Book in the BhaddasÄlajÄtaka [Ja 465].

Tradition tells us that she was the daughter of MahÄnÄma Sakka by a slave girl named NÄgamuá¹á¸Ä, and that she afterwards became the consort of the king of Kosala. She conceived a son by the king; but the king, coming to know of her servile origin, degraded her from her rank, and also degraded her son Viá¸Å«á¸abha. Mother and son never came outside the palace.


Hearing of this, the Teacher at early dawn came to the palace attended by five hundred monks, and, sitting down on the seat prepared for him, said: âSire, where is VÄsabhakhattiyÄ?â


Then the king told him what had happened.


âSire, whose daughter is VÄsabhakhattiyÄ?â âMahÄnÄmaâs daughter, sir.â âWhen she came away, to whom did she come as wife?â âTo me, sir.â âSire, she is a kingâs daughter; to a king she is wed; and to a king she bore her son. Wherefore is that son not in authority over the realm which owns his fatherâs sway? In bygone days, a monarch who had a son by a casual faggot-gatherer gave that son his sovereignty.â

It was to drive home that lesson that he told this story of the past.

Those hounds reared by the royal family, well-bred and endowed with good looks and strength, these are not slaughtered, but we are slaughtered, this is not just, only the weak are killed.

When the Teacher had ended this lesson, and had said: âNot only now, monks, does the TathÄgata do what profits his kindred; in former times also he did the like,â he showed the connection, and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âÄnanda was the king of those days, the Buddhaâs followers were the others, and I myself was the dog.â

## Full Story
âIn different places.â
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about an ex-goldsmith, who had become a monk and was co-resident with (SÄriputta) the Captain of the Dhamma.


Now, it is only a Buddha who has knowledge of the hearts and can read the thoughts of men; and therefore through lack of this power, the Captain of the Dhamma had so little knowledge of the heart and thoughts of his co-resident, as to prescribe impurity as theme for meditation. This was no good to that monk. The reason why it was no good to him was that, according to tradition, he had invariably been born, throughout five hundred successive births, as a goldsmith; and, consequently, the cumulative effect of seeing absolutely pure gold for so long a time had made theme of impurity useless. He spent four months without being able to get so much as the first inkling of the idea. Finding himself unable to confer Arahatship on his co-resident, the Captain of the Dhamma thought to himself, âThis must certainly be one whom none but a Buddha can convert; I will take him to the TathÄgata.â So at early dawn he came with the monk to the Teacher.


âWhat can it be, SÄriputta,â said the Teacher, âthat has brought you here with this monk?â âSir, I gave him a theme for meditation, and after four months he has not attained to so much as the first inkling of the idea; so I brought him to you, thinking that here was one whom none but a Buddha can convert.â âWhat meditation, SÄriputta, did you prescribe for him?â âThe meditation on impurity, Fortunate One.â âSÄriputta, it is not yours to have knowledge of the hearts and to read the thoughts of men. Depart now alone, and in the evening come back to fetch your co-resident.â


After thus dismissing the elder, the Teacher had that monk clad in a nice under-robe and a robe, kept him constantly at his side when he went into town for alms, and saw that he received choice food of all kinds. Returning to the monastery once more, surrounded by the monks, the Teacher retired during the daytime 
{1.183}
 to his perfumed chamber, and at evening, as he walked about the monastery with that monk by his side, he made a pond appear and in it a great clump of lotuses out of which grew a great lotus-flower. âSit here, monk,â he said, âand gaze at this flower.â And, leaving the monk seated thus, he retired to his perfumed chamber.


That monk gazed and gazed at that flower. The Fortunate One made it decay. As the monk looked at it, the flower in its decay faded; the Petals 
[1.65]
 fell off, beginning at the rim, till in a little while all were gone; then the stamens fell away, and only the pericarp was left. As he looked, that monk thought within himself, âEven now, this lotus-flower was lovely and fair; yet its colour is departed, and only the pericarp is left standing. Decay has come upon this beautiful lotus; what may not befall my body? Transitory are all compounded things!â And with the thought he won Insight.


Knowing that the monkâs mind had risen to Insight, the Teacher, seated as he was in his perfumed chamber, emitted a radiant semblance of himself, and uttered this verse:

âPluck out self-love, as with the hand you pluck

The autumn water-lily. Set your heart

On naught but this, the perfect Path of Peace,

And that NibbÄna which the Buddha taught.â

At the close of this verse, that monk became an Arahat. At the thought that he would never be born again, never be troubled with existence in any shape hereafter, he burst into a exalted utterance beginning with these verses:

âHe who has lived his life, whose thought is ripe;

He who, from all defilements purged and free,

Wears his last body; he whose life is pure,

Whose subject senses own him sovereign lord;


He, like the moon that wins her way at last

From RÄhuâs jaws, 
RÄhu was a kind of Asura who was thought to cause eclipses by temporarily swallowing the sun and moon.
 has won supreme release.


The foulness which enveloped me, which wrought

Delusionâs utter darkness, I dispelled;

â As, tricked with thousand rays, the beaming sun

Illumines heaven with a flood of light.â

After this and renewed exalted utterance, he went to the Fortunate One and saluted him. The elder, too, came, and after due salutation to the Teacher, went away with his co-resident.


When news of all this spread among the monks, 
{1.184}
 they gathered together in the Dhamma Hall and there sat praising the virtues of the One with Ten Powers, and saying: âSirs, through not knowing the hearts and thoughts of men, the elder SÄriputta was ignorant of his co-residentâs disposition. But the Teacher knew, and in a single day bestowed on him Arahatship together with analytic knowledges. Oh, how great are the marvellous powers of a Buddha!â Entering and taking the seat set ready for him, the Teacher asked, saying: âWhat is theme of your discourse here in a meeting, monks?â âNaught else, Fortunate One, than this â that you alone had knowledge of the heart, and could read the thoughts, of the co-resident of the Captain of the Dhamma.â âThis is no marvel, monks; that I, as Buddha, should now know that monkâs disposition. Even in bygone days I knew it equally well.â And, so saying, he told this story of the past.

In different places let the horse drink, driver, for one sitting too long, eâen milk-rice is torment.

When the Teacher had ended his lesson and had repeated what he had said as to his knowledge, in the past as well as the present, of that monkâs disposition, he showed the connection, and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThis monk was the state-charger of those days; Änanda was the king and I myself the wise minister.â

## Full Story
âConsidering the former thievesâ word.â
 
[1.67]
 This story was told by the Teacher while at the Bamboo Grove, about Devadatta, who, having secured the adherence of prince AjÄtasattu, had attained both gain and honour. Prince AjÄtasattu had a monastery built for Devadatta at GayÄsÄ«sa, and every day brought to him 
{1.186}
 five hundred pots of perfumed three-year-old rice flavoured with all the choicest flavourings. All this gain and honour brought Devadatta a great following, with whom Devadatta lived on, without ever stirring out of his monastery.


At that time there were living in RÄjagaha two friends, of whom one had taken the vows under the Teacher, while the other had taken them under Devadatta. And these continued to see one another, either casually or by visiting the monasteries. Now one day the disciple of Devadatta said to the other, âSir, why do you daily go round for alms with the sweat streaming off you? Devadatta sits quietly at GayÄsÄ«sa and feeds on the best of fare, flavoured with all the choicest flavourings. Thereâs no way like his. Why create misery for yourself? Why should it not be a good thing for you to come the first thing in the morning to the monastery at GayÄsÄ«sa and there drink our rice-gruel with a relish after it, try our eighteen kinds of solid victuals, and enjoy our excellent soft food, flavoured with all the choicest flavourings?â


Being pressed time after time to accept the invitation, the other began to want to go, and thenceforth used to go to GayÄsÄ«sa and there eat and eat, not forgetting however to return to the Bamboo Grove at the proper hour. Nevertheless he could not keep it secret always; and in a little while it came out that he used to go off to GayÄsÄ«sa and there regale himself with the food provided for Devadatta. Accordingly, his friends asked him, saying: âIs it true, as they say, that you regale yourself on the food provided for Devadatta?â âWho said that?â said he. âSo-and-so said it.â âIt is true, sirs, that I go to GayÄsÄ«sa and eat there. But it is not Devadatta who gives me food; others do that.â âSir, Devadatta is the foe of the Buddhas; in his wickedness, he has secured the adherence of AjÄtasattu and by unrighteousness got gain and honour for himself. Yet you who have taken the vows according to this dispensation which leads to safety, eat the food which Devadatta gets by unrighteousness. Come, let us bring you before the Teacher.â


And, taking with them the monk, they went to the Dhamma Hall. When the Teacher became aware of their presence, he said: âMonks, are you bringing this monk here against his will?â âYes, sir, this monk, after taking the vows under you, eats the food which Devadatta gets by unrighteousness.â âIs it true, as they say, that you eat the food which Devadatta gets by unrighteousness?â âIt was not Devadatta, sir, that gave it me, but others.â âRaise no quibbles here, monk,â said the Teacher. âDevadatta is a man of bad conduct and bad principle. Oh, how could you, who have taken the vows in the Buddhaâs dispensation, eat Devadattaâs food, while living in the Teacherâs presence? But you have always been prone to being led away, and have followed in turn every one you meet.â And, so saying, he told this story of the past.
 [1.68]

Considering the former thievesâ word, Mahiá¸·Ämukha roamed round lashing out, considering the word of the restrained, the elephant supreme was established in all virtues.

Said the Teacher, âIn the past, too, you followed everyone you met, monk; hearing burglars talk, you followed what they said; and hearing the wise and good talk, you followed what they said.â His lesson ended, he showed the connection, and identified the JÄtaka, by saying: âThe traitorous monk was MahilÄmukha of those days, Änanda the king, and I myself the minister.â

âNo morsel is sufficient to receive.â
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a lay-disciple and an aged elder. 
{1.189}


Tradition says that there were in SÄvatthi two friends, of whom one joined the Saá¹gha but used to go every day to the otherâs house, where his friend used to give him alms food and make a meal himself, and then accompany him back to the monastery, where he sat talking all the livelong day till the sun went down, when he went back to town. And his friend the monk used to escort him on his homeward way, going as far as the city-gates before turning back.


The intimacy of these two became known among the monks, who were sitting one day in the Dhamma Hall, talking about the intimacy which existed between the pair, when the Teacher, entering the Hall, asked what was the subject of their talk; and the monks told him. âNot only now, monks, are these two intimate with one another,â said the Teacher, âthey were intimate in bygone days as well.â And, so saying, he told this story of the past.

No morsel is sufficient to receive, no rice, and no grass, and no rubbing down, I think through seeing him regularly, the elephant had affection for the dog.

Thus the Teacher ended his lesson to show that the two were intimate in bygone days as well as at that date. This done, he unfolded the Four Truths. (This unfolding of the Four Truths forms part of all the other JÄtakas; but we shall only mention it where it is expressly mentioned that it was blessed unto fruit.) Then he showed the connection, and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThe lay-disciple was the dog of those days, the aged elder was the elephant, and I myself the wise minister.â

[1.71]
 
{1.191}
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about the bitter words spoken by the group of six. 
The âsixâ were notorious monks who are always mentioned as defying the rules of the Saá¹gha.
 For, in those days the group of six, when they disagreed with respectable monks, used to taunt, revile and jeer them, and load them with the ten kinds of abuse. This the monks reported to the Fortunate One, who sent for the group of six and asked whether this charge was true. On their admitting its truth, he rebuked them, saying: âMonks, hard words gall even animals: in bygone days an animal made a man who had used harsh language to him lose a thousand pieces.â And, so saying, he told this story of the past.

Thus laying down, by way of rebuke to the Six, the rule 
[Now recorded as PÄcittiya 2 in the 
BhikkhupÄtimokkha
.]
 that hard words please no one, the Teacher, after Fully Awakening, uttered this verse:

You should surely speak pleasantly, and speak nothing unpleasantly, for the one who spoke pleasantly he pulled a very heavy load, because of that he received wealth and satisfaction, it is said.

When he had thus ended his lesson as to speaking only words of kindness, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka by saying: âÄnanda was the brahmin of those days, and I myself NandivisÄla.â

âHowever onerous the load.â
 
[1.73]
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about the Double Miracle, which, together with the Descent from Heaven, will be related in the Thirteenth Book, in the SarabhamigajÄtaka [Ja 483].

The Teacher, for the confounding of the schismatics having performed a twofold miracle passing marvellous among his disciples, caused faith to spring up in multitudes, then arose and, sitting in the Buddhaâs seat, declared the Dhamma. Twenty crores of beings drank of the waters of life. Then, meditating to see whither it was that former Buddhas went when they had done a miracle, and perceiving that it was to the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, up he rose from the Buddhaâs seat, the right foot he placed on the top of Mount Yugandhara, and with his left strode to the peak of Sineru, he began the season of rains under the great Coral Tree, seated upon the yellow-stone throne; for the space of three months he discoursed upon the Abhidhamma to the gods.

After he had performed the Double Miracle and had made a stay in Heaven, the All-knowing Buddha descended at the city of Saá¹kassa on the day of the Great PavÄraá¹Ä 
The festival at the end of the rainy season (
MahÄvagga
 iv. 1).
 Festival, and thence passed with a large following to Jetavana.


Gathering together in the Dhamma Hall, the monks sat praising the virtues of the Teacher, saying: âSirs, peerless is the TathÄgata; none may bear the yoke borne by the TathÄgata. The six teachers, though they protested so often that they, and they only, would perform miracles, yet not a single miracle did they work. O! How peerless is the Teacher!â Entering the Hall and asking theme which the monks were discussing in a meeting, 
{1.194}
 the Teacher was informed that their theme was none other than his own virtues. âMonks,â said the Teacher, âwho shall now bear the yoke borne by me? Even in bygone days, when I came to life as an animal, I was unmatched.â And, so saying, he told this story of the past.

When he had ended this lesson to show that the Buddha was unmatched in the past as then, he showed the connection by uttering, after Fully Awakening, this verse: 
{1.196}

However onerous the load, however deep the pathway is, at that time they harness Kaá¹ha, and he carries away the load.

After his lesson to show that only KÄá¸·aka could draw the load, he showed the connection, and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âUppalavaá¹á¹Ä was the old woman of those days, and I myself AyyakÄ KÄá¸·aka.â

I will use her as bait for a fish, and make one of those SÄkiyan ascetics come back to the world, and live upon him.â


At the time there was a young man of good birth living in SÄvatthi, who had given his heart to the dispensation and went forth. But from the time when he had received full ordination he had lost all desire for learning, and lived devoted to the adornment of his person.


The lay sister used to prepare in her house rice gruel, and other food hard or soft, and standing at the door, as the monks walked along the streets, looked out for someone who could be tempted by the craving for delicacies. Streaming by went a crowd of monks who upheld the Three Baskets, including the Abhidhamma and the Vinaya; but among them she saw none ready to rise to her bait. Among the figures with bowl and robe, preachers of the Dhamma with honey-sweet voice, moving like fleecy scud before the wind, she saw not one.


But at last she perceived a man approaching, the outer corners of his eyes anointed, hair hanging down, wearing an under-robe of fine cloth, and an outer robe shaken and cleansed, bearing a bowl coloured like some precious gem, and a sunshade after his own heart, a man who let his senses have their own way, his body much bronzed. âHere is a man I can catch!â thought she; and greeting him, she took his bowl, and invited him into the house. She found him a seat, and provided rice gruel and all the rest; then after the meal, begged him to make that house his resort in future. So he used to visit the house after that, and in course of time became intimate.


One day, the lay sister said in his hearing, âIn this household we are happy enough, only I have no son or son-in-law capable of keeping it up.â The man heard it, and wondering what reason she could have for so saying, in a little while he was as it were pierced to the heart. She said to her daughter, âTempt this man, and get him into your power.â So the girl after that time decked herself and adorned herself, and tempted him with all womenâs tricks and wiles. Then the man, being young and under the power of passion, thought in his heart, âI cannot now hold on to the Buddhaâs dispensation,â and he went to the monastery, and laying down bowl and robe, said to his spiritual teachers, âI am discontented.â


Then they conducted him to the Teacher, and said: âSir, this monk is discontented.â

Then the Teacher asked that monk, saying: âIs it true, monk, as they say, that you are overcome by passion?â âIt is true, sir,â was the reply. âMonk,â said the Teacher, âshe is your bane; even in bygone days, you met your end and were made into a relish for the company on her marriage-day.â And so saying, he told this story of the past.

Do not envy Munika,  he eats food ending in misery, being unconcerned eat your chaff, that is the mark of a long life.

When he had ended his lesson to the effect that the monk had thus in bygone days been brought to his doom by that young woman and had been made into a relish for the company, 
{1.198}
 he preached the Truths, at the close whereof the monk overcome by passion reached the First Path. Also the Teacher showed the connection and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThe monk overcome by passion was the pig Muá¹ika of those days, the young woman is the same in both cases, Änanda was Cullalohita, and I myself MahÄlohita.â

## Full Story
âMay nestlings.â
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a monk who drank water without straining it. 
As to the rules for filtering water, see 
Vinaya
 
Cullavagga
 v. 13.


Tradition says that two young monks who were friends went from SÄvatthi into the country, and took up their abode in a pleasant spot. After staying there as long as they wanted, they departed and set out for Jetavana in order to see the Perfect Buddha.
 [1.77]


One of them carried a strainer; the other had none; so both of them used the same strainer before drinking. One day they fell out. The owner of the strainer did not lend it to his companion, but strained and drank alone by himself.


As the other was not allowed the strainer, and as he could not endure his thirst, he drank water without straining it. In due course both reached Jetavana and with respectful salutation to the Teacher took their seats. After friendly words of greeting, he asked whence they had come.


âSir,â they said, âwe have been living in a hamlet in the Kosala country, whence we have come in order to see you.â âI trust you have arrived as good friends, as you started?â Said the monk without a strainer, âSir, he fell out with me on the road and would not lend me his strainer.â Said the other, âSir, he didnât strain his water, but â wittingly â drank it down with all the living things it contained.â âIs this report true, monk, that you wittingly drank off water with all the living things it contained?â âYes, sir, I did drink unstrained water,â was the reply. âMonk, the wise and good of bygone days, when flying on their route along the deep in the days of their sovereignty over the City of the Devas, thought scorn to slay living-creatures in order to secure power for themselves. Rather, they turned their chariot back, sacrificing great glory in order to save the lives of the young of the Garuá¸·as.â 
Garuá¸·as
 were winged creatures of a supernatural order, the inveterate foes of the 
NÄgas
, whose domain was the water. cf. (

 And, so saying, he told this story of the past.
 {1.199}

May nestlings amongst the silk-cotton trees avoid the chariot pole, MÄtali, we forsake our lives to the Asuras, gladly, let not the birds be without nests.

His lesson ended, the Teacher rebuked that monk in these words, âThus, monks, the wise and good of bygone days when they were rulers of the Devas, forbore, even at the sacrifice of their own lives, to be guilty of slaughter. And can you, who have devoted yourself to so saving a dispensation, drink unstrained water with all the living creatures it contains?â And he showed the connection and identified the JÄtaka, by saying: âÄnanda was then MÄtali the charioteer, and I was Sakka.â

In the present a rich man ordains in the Saá¹gha, and makes sure he has all provisions for his life. When taken to the Buddha because of his indulgence he flings off his clothes in protest, and later disrobes.

She chose a peacock, but when he danced for her, he exposed himself, and the king reprimanded him, and gave her to another.

## Full Story
âA pleasing voice.â
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a monk with many belongings. The incident is just the same as in the DevadhammajÄtaka [Ja 6] above.

Tradition tells us that, on the death of his wife, a householder of SÄvatthi joined the Saá¹gha. When he was joining, he caused to be built for himself a chamber to live in, a room for the fire, and a store-room; and not till he had stocked his store-room with ghee, rice, and the like, did he finally join. Even after he had become a monk, he used to send for his servants and make them cook him what he liked to eat. He was richly provided with the requisites â having an entire change of clothing for night and another for day; and he dwelt aloof on the outskirts of the monastery.


One day when he had taken out his cloths and bedding and had spread them out to dry in his chamber, a number of monks from the country, who were on a pilgrimage from monastery to monastery, came in their journeying to his cell and found all these belongings.


âWhose are these?â they asked. âMine, sirs,â he replied. âWhat, sir?â they cried, âthis upper-cloth and that as well; this under-robe as well as that; and that bedding too, is it all yours?â âYes, nobodyâs but mine.â âSir,â they said, âthe Fortunate One has only sanctioned three cloths; and yet, though the Buddha, to whose dispensation you have devoted yourself, is so simple in his wants, you forsooth have amassed all this stock of requisites. Come! We must take you before the One with Ten Powers.â And, so saying, they went off with him to the Teacher.


Becoming aware of their presence, the Teacher said: âWherefore is it, monks, that you have brought the monk against his will?â âSir, this monk is well-off and has quite a stock of requisites.â

âIs this report true, monk,â said the Teacher, âthat you have many belongings?â âYes, sir.â âWhy have you come to own so many belongings?â Without listening beyond this point, the monk tore off the whole of his raiment, and stood stark naked before the Teacher, crying, âIâll go about like this!â âOh, fie!â exclaimed every one. The man ran away, and reverted to the lower state of a layman.


Gathering together in the Dhamma Hall, the monks talked of his impropriety in behaving in that manner right before the Teacher. In came the Teacher and asked what was theme of discussion in the conclave. âSir,â was the answer, âwe were discussing the impropriety of that monk, and saying that in your presence and right before all the four classes of your followers 
i.e. Monk
s, nuns, lay-brothers, and lay-sisters.
 he had so far lost all sense of shame as to stand there stark naked as a village-urchin, and that, finding himself loathed by everyone, he relapsed to the lower state and lost the faith.â Said the Teacher, âMonks, this is not the only loss his shamelessness has caused him; for in bygone days he lost a jewel of a wife just as now he has lost the jewel of the dispensation.â And so saying, he told this story of the past. 
{1.207}

A pleasing voice and a brilliant back, a neck coloured like lapis lazuli. Tail-feathers a fathom in length: because of the dance, I donât give you our daughter.

âThus, monks,â said the Teacher, âthis is not the only time his breach of modesty has caused him loss; just as it has now caused him to lose the jewel of the dispensation, so in bygone days it lost him a jewel of a wife.â When he had ended this lesson, he showed the connection and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThe monk with the many belongings was the peacock of those days, and I myself the Royal Mallard.â

## Full Story
âJoyously.â
 
[1.85]
 This story was told by the Teacher while dwelling in the Banyan-grove near Kapilavatthu, about a squabble over a porterâs head-pad, as will be related in the Kuá¹ÄlajÄtaka [Ja 536].

This was a story told by the Teacher, while dwelling beside lake Kuá¹Äla, concerning five hundred monks who were overwhelmed with discontent. Here follows the story in due order. The SÄkiya and Koliya tribes had the river RohinÄ« which flows between the cities of Kapilavatthu and Koliya confined by a single dam and by means of it cultivated their crops. In the month Jeá¹­á¹­hamÅ«la when the crops began to flag and droop, the labourers from amongst the dwellers of both cities assembled together. Then the people of Koliya said: âShould this water be drawn off on both sides, it will not prove sufficient for both us and you. But our crops will thrive with a single watering; give us then the water.â The people of Kapilavatthu said: âWhen you have filled your garners with corn, we shall hardly have the courage to come with ruddy gold, emeralds and copper coins, and with baskets and sacks in our hands, to hang about your doors. Our crops too will thrive with a single watering; give us the water.â âWe will not give it,â they said. âNeither will we,â said the others.


As words thus ran high, one of them rose up and struck another a blow, and he in turn struck a third and thus it was that what with interchanging of blows and spitefully touching on the origin of their princely families they increased the tumult. The Koliya labourers said: âBe off with your people of Kapilavatthu, men who like dogs, jackals, and such like beasts, cohabited with their own sisters. What will their elephants and horses, their shields and spears avail against us?â The SÄkiya labourers replied, âNay, do you, wretched lepers, be off with your children, destitute and ill-conditioned fellows, who like brute beasts had their dwelling in a hollow jujube tree (koli). What shall their elephants and horses, their spears and shields avail against us?â


So they went and told the councillors appointed to such services and they reported it to the princes of their tribes. Then the SÄkiyas said: âWe will show them how strong and mighty are the men who cohabited with their sisters,â and they sallied forth, ready for the fray. And the Koliyas said: âWe will show them how strong and mighty are they who dwelt in the hollow of a jujube tree,â and they too sallied forth ready for the fight.


But other teachers tell the story thus, âWhen the female slaves of the SÄkiyas and Koliyas came to the river to fetch water, and throwing the coils of cloth that they carried on their heads upon the ground were seated and pleasantly conversing, a certain woman took anotherâs cloth, thinking it was her own; and when owing to this a quarrel arose, each claiming the coil of cloth as hers, gradually the people of the two cities, the serfs and the labourers, the attendants, headmen, councillors and viceroys, all of them sallied forth ready for battle.â

On this occasion, however, the Teacher spoke thus to his kinsfolk, âMy lords, strife among kinsfolk is unseemly. Yes, in bygone times, animals, who had defeated their enemies when they lived in concord, came to utter destruction when they fell out.â And at the request of his royal kinsfolk, he told this story of the past.

Joyously the birds fly away, carrying the net together, when they begin to quarrel, then they will come into my power.

âThus, sire,â said the Teacher, âsuch a thing as a quarrel among kinsfolk is unseemly; quarrelling leads only to destruction.â His lesson ended, he showed the connection, and identified the JÄtaka, by saying: âDevadatta was the foolish quail of those days, and I myself the wise and good quail.â

It was through her that in bygone times too you were meeting your end, when you were saved by me.â And so saying, he told this story of the past.

Itâs not the cold or heat for me, not the being caught in a net, but my lady  thinking of me: âHe went for joy to another.â

His lesson ended, the Teacher preached the Truths, at the close whereof the monk overcome by passion won the First Path. Also, the Teacher showed the connection and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThe former wife was the female fish of those days, the monk overcome by passion was the male fish, and I myself the family priest.â

## Full Story
âHaving wings that fly not.â
 This story was told by the Teacher, while on an alms pilgrimage through Magadha, about the going-out of a jungle fire. Once the Teacher, while on an alms pilgrimage through Magadha, went on his morning round for alms through a certain hamlet in that country; on his return, after his meal, he went out again followed by the company of the monks. Just then a great fire broke out. There were numbers of monks both in front of the Teacher and behind him. On came the fire, spreading far and wide, till all was one sheet of smoke and flame. Hereupon, some unconverted monks were seized with the fear of death. âLet us make a counter fire,â they cried, âand then the big fire will not sweep over the ground we have fired.â And, with this view, they set about kindling a fire with their tinder-sticks.


But others said: âWhat is this you do, monks? You are like such as mark not the moon in mid-heaven, or the sunâs orb rising with myriad rays from the east, or the sea on whose shores they stand, or Mount Sineru towering before their very eyes â when, as you journey along in the company of him who is peerless among Devas and men alike, you give not a thought to the Supreme Buddha, but cry out, âLet us make a fire!â You know not the might of a Buddha! Come, let us go to the Teacher.â Then, gathering together from front and rear alike, the monks in a body flocked round the One with Ten Powers. At a certain spot the Teacher halted, with this mighty assembly of the monks surrounding him. On rolled the flames, roaring as though to devour them. But when they approached the spot where the TathÄgata had taken his stand, they came no nearer than sixteen lengths, but there and then went out â even as a torch plunged into water. It had no power to spread over a space thirty-two lengths in diameter.
 [1.89]


The monks burst into praises of the Teacher, saying: âOh! How great are the virtues of a Buddha! For, even this fire, though lacking sense, could not sweep over the spot where a Buddha stood, but went out like a torch in water. Oh! How marvellous are the powers of a Buddha!â 
{1.213}


Hearing their words, the Teacher said: âIt is no present power of mine, monks, that makes this fire go out on reaching this spot of ground. It is the power of a former âAssertion of Truthâ of mine. For in this spot no fire will burn throughout the whole of this aeon, the miracle being one which endures for an aeon.â 
[See Ja 20 
Naá¸·apÄnajÄtaka
, in which this 
JÄtaka
 and wonder is mentioned.]


Then the elder Änanda folded a robe into four and spread it for the Teacher to sit on. The Teacher took his seat. Bowing to the TathÄgata as he sat cross-legged there, the monks too seated themselves around him. Then they asked him, saying: âOnly the present is known to us, sir; the past is hidden from us. Make it known to us.â And, at their request, he told this story of the past.

Having wings that fly not, having feet that run not, abandoned by parents: JÄtaveda, go back!

âThus, monks,â said the Teacher, âit is not my present power but the power of truth made when a young quail, that has made the flames pass over this spot in the jungle.â His lesson ended, he preached the Truths, at the close whereof some won the First, some the Second, some the Third Path, while others again became Arahats. Also, the Teacher showed the connection and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âMy present parents were the parents of those days, and I myself the king of the quails.â

âYou birds who depend.â
 
[1.91]
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a monk whose cell burnt down.


Tradition says that a monk, having been given a theme for meditation by the Teacher, went from Jetavana to the land of Kosala and there lived in a dwelling in a forest nearby a border-village. Now, during the very first month of his dwelling there, his cell burnt down. This he reported to the villagers, saying: âMy cell has been burnt down; I live in discomfort.â They said: âThe land is suffering from drought just now; weâll see to it when we have irrigated the fields.â When the irrigation was over, they said they must do their sowing first; when the sowing was done, they had the fences to put up; when the fences were put up; they had first to do the weeding and the reaping, and the threshing; till, what with one job and another which they kept mentioning, three whole months passed by.


After three months spent in the open air in discomfort, that monk had developed his theme for meditation, but could get no further. So, after the PavÄraá¹Ä festival which ends the Rainy Season, he went back again to the Teacher, and, with due salutation, took his seat aside. After kindly words of greeting, the Teacher said: âWell, monk, have you lived happily through the Rainy Season? Did your theme for meditation end in success?â The monk told him all that had happened, adding, âAs I had no lodging to suit me, my theme did not end in success.â


Said the Teacher, âIn bygone times, monk, even animals knew what suited them and what did not. How is it that you did not know?â And so saying, he told this story of the past. 
{1.216}

You birds who depend on this tree, beware, the fire has been set free,  birds! Resort to the quarters, danger arises from our refuge!

âThus, monks,â said the Teacher, âin bygone times even animals who were dwelling in the tree-top, knew what suited them and what did not. How is it that you did not know?â 
{1.217}
 His lesson ended, he preached the Truths, at the close whereof that monk won the Fruit of the First Path. Also, the Teacher showed the connection, and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThe Buddhaâs disciples were then the birds who hearkened to the Bodhisatta, and I myself was the wise and good bird.â

For, when AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika had built his monastery, and had sent word that it was finished, the Teacher left RÄjagaha and came to VesÄlÄ«, setting out again on his journey after stopping at the latter place during his pleasure. It was now that the disciples of the Six hurried on ahead, and, before quarters could be taken for the elders, monopolized the whole of the available lodgings, which they distributed among their superiors, their teachers, and themselves. When the elders came up later, they could find no quarters at all for the night. Even SÄriputtaâs disciples, for all their searching, could not find lodgings for the elder. Being without a lodging, the elder passed the night at the foot of a tree near the Teacherâs quarters, either walking up and down or sitting at the foot of a tree.


At early dawn the Teacher coughed as he came out. The elder coughed too. âWho is that?â asked the Teacher. âIt is I, SÄriputta, sir.â âWhat are you doing here at this hour, SÄriputta?â Then the elder told his story, at the close of which the Teacher thought: âEven now, while I am still alive, the monks lack courtesy and subordination; what will they not do when I am dead and gone?â And the thought filled him with anxiety for the Dhamma. As soon as day had come, he had the assembly of the monks called together, and asked them, saying: âIs it true, monks, as I hear, that the adherents of the Six went on ahead and kept the elders among the monks out of lodgings for the night?â âThat is so, Fortunate One,â was the reply. Thereupon, with a reproof to the adherents of the Six and as a lesson to all, he addressed the monks, and said: âTell me, who deserves the best lodging, the best water, and the best rice, monks?â
 [1.93]


Some answered, âHe who was a nobleman before he became a monk.â Others said: âHe who was originally a brahmin, or a man of means.â Others severally said: âThe man versed in the Regulations of the Saá¹gha; the man who can expound the Dhamma; the men who have won the first, second, third, or fourth stage of Absorption.â While others again said: âThe man in the First, Second, or Third path, or an Arahat; one who knows the Three Understandings; 
[I.e. one who can remember his former lives, has the divine eye, and understands the pollutants are destroyed. These three the Buddha gained on the night of his Awakening.]
 one who has the Six Higher Super Knowledges.â


After the monks had stated whom they severally thought worthiest of precedence in the matter of lodging and the like, the Teacher said, 
{1.218}
 âIn the dispensation which I teach, the standard by which precedence in the matter of lodging and the like is to be settled, is not noble birth, or having been a brahmin, or having been wealthy before entry into the Saá¹gha; the standard is not familiarity with the Regulations of the Saá¹gha, with the Suttas, or with the Abhidhamma Books; 
i.e.
 the three divisions, or âthree baskets,â of the Buddhist scriptures.
 nor is it either the attainment of any of the four stages of Absorption, or the walking in any of the four paths of emancipation. Monks, in my dispensation it is seniority which claims respect of word and deed, salutation, and all due service; it is seniors who should enjoy the best lodging, the best water, and the best rice. This is the true standard, and therefore the senior monk ought to have these things. Yet, monks, here is SÄriputta, who is my chief disciple, who has set rolling the Wheel in line with Dhamma, and who deserves to have a lodging next after myself. And SÄriputta has spent this night without a lodging at the foot of a tree! If you lack respect and subordination even now, what will be your behaviour as time goes by?â


And for their further instruction he said: âIn times past, monks, even animals came to the conclusion that it was not proper for them to live without respect and subordination one to another, or without the ordering of their common life; even these animals decided to find out which among them was the senior, and then to show him all forms of reverence. So they looked into the matter, and having found out which of them was the senior, they showed him all forms of reverence, whereby they passed away at that lifeâs close to people heaven.â And so saying, he told this story of the past.

It was at the close of this lesson that the Teacher, after Fully Awakening, repeated this verse:

Those people who are skilled in Dhamma pay homage to an elder, praised in this life, in the next world they will go to a happy state. 
{1.220}

When the Teacher had finished speaking of the virtue of reverencing age, he made the connection and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âMoggallÄna was the elephant of those days, SÄriputta the monkey, and I myself the sage partridge.â

## Full Story
âThe clever cheat.â
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a tailoring monk.


Tradition says that at Jetavana dwelt a monk who was exceedingly skilful in all operations to be performed with a robe, such as cutting, joining, arranging, and stitching. Because of this skill, he used to fashion robes and so got the name of CÄ«varavaá¸á¸haka [The Robe-tailor]. What, you ask, did he do? Well, he exercised his craft on old bits of cloth and turned out a nice soft robe, which, after the dyeing was done, he would enhance in colour with a wash containing flour to make a dressing, and rub it with a shell, till he had made it quite smart and attractive. Then he would lay his handiwork aside.


Being ignorant of robe-making, monks used to come to him with brand-new cloth, saying: âWe donât know how to make robes; you make them for us.â


âSirs,â he would reply, âa robe takes a long time to make; but I have one which is just finished. You can take that, if you will leave these cloths in exchange.â And, so saying, he would take his out and show it them. And they, marking only its fine colour, and knowing nothing of what it was made of, thought it was a good strong one, and so handed over their brand-new cloth to the CÄ«varavaá¸á¸haka and went off with the robe he gave them. When it got dirty and was being washed in hot water, it revealed its real character, and the worn patches were visible here and there. Then the owners regretted their bargain. Everywhere that monk became well-known for deceiving in this way all who came to him.


Now, there was a robe-maker in a hamlet who used to deceive everybody just as the monk did at Jetavana. 
{1.221}
 This manâs friends among the monks said to him, âSir, they say that at Jetavana there is a robe-maker who deceives everybody just like you.â Then the thought struck him, âCome now, let me deceive that city man!â So he made out of rags a very fine robe, which he dyed a beautiful orange. This he put on and went to Jetavana. The moment the other saw it, he coveted it, and said to its owner, âSir, did you make that robe?â âYes, I did, sir,â was the reply. âLet me have that robe, sir; youâll get another in its place.â âBut, sir, we village monks find it hard to get the Requisites; if I give you this, what shall I have to wear myself?â âSir, I have some brand-new cloth at my lodging; take it and make yourself a robe.â âVenerable sir, herein have I shown my own handiwork; but, if you speak thus, what can I do? Take it.â And having deceived the other by exchanging the rag-robe for the new cloth, he went his way.


After wearing the botched robe in his turn, the Jetavana man was washing it not long afterwards in warm water, when he became aware that it was made out of rags; and he was put to shame. The whole of the Saá¹gha heard the news that the Jetavana man had been deceived by a robe-tailor from the country.
 [1.96]


Now, one day the monks were seated in the Dhamma Hall, discussing the news, when the Teacher entered and asked what they were discussing; and they told him all about it. Said the Teacher, âMonks, this is not the only occasion of the Jetavana robe-makerâs deceiving tricks; in bygone times also he did just the same, and, as he has been deceived now by the man from the country, so was he too in bygone times.â And so saying, he told this story of the past.

The clever cheat cannot attain final happiness through cheating, the clever cheat gets a like return, just like the crane with the crab. 
[1.98]
 
{1.224}

âMonks,â said the Teacher, âthis is not the first time this fellow has been deceived by the robe-maker from the country; in the past he was deceived in just the same manner.â His lesson ended, he showed the connection, and identified the JÄtaka, by saying: âThe Jetavana robe-maker was [the crane] of those days, the robe-maker from the country was the crab, and I myself the Tree DevatÄ.â

In the present a pupil of Elder SÄriputtaâs becomes puffed up when he goes into the countryside with him, but is docile again when back in Jetavana. When the Buddha hears of this he tells a story about a servant in olden times who was entrusted with the secret location of a treasure, and would become conceited when he was close to the spot. The treasureâs rightful heir regained his fortune by following the Bodhisattaâs advice.

## Full Story
âI know that the valuable stack.â
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a co-resident pupil of SÄriputta.


Tradition says that this monk was meek and docile, and was zealous in ministering to the elder. Now, on one occasion the elder departed with the leave of the Teacher, on an alms pilgrimage, and came to south Magadha. When he got there, that monk grew so proud that he would not do what the elder told him. Moreover, if he was addressed with, âSir, do this,â he quarrelled with the elder. The elder could not make out what possessed him.


After making his pilgrimage in those parts, he came back again to Jetavana. The moment he got back to the monastery at Jetavana, the monk became again what he had always been.


The elder told this to the TathÄgata, saying: âSir, a co-resident of mine is in one place like a slave bought for a hundred pieces, and in another so proud-stomached that an order to do anything makes him quarrel.â


Said the Teacher, âThis is not the first time, SÄriputta, that he has shown this disposition; in the past too, if he went to one place, he was like a slave bought for a hundred pieces, while, if he went to another place, he would become quarrelsome and contentious.â And, so saying, by request of the elder, he told this story of the past.

I know that the valuable stack, the fatherâs valuable array, is where the slave-born servant Nandaka stands and loudly curses!

Said the Teacher, âIn the past too this man was similarly disposed.â His lesson ended, he showed the connection, and identified the JÄtaka, by saying, SÄriputtaâs co-resident was the Nanda of those days, and I the wise and good householder,â

âGladly will I fall head-first.â
 
 [1.100]
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika.


For AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika, who had lavished fifty-four crores on the dispensation of the Buddha over the monastery alone, and who valued naught else save only the Three Jewels, used to go every day while the Teacher was at Jetavana to attend the Great Services â once at daybreak, once after breakfast, and once in the evening. There were intermediate services too; but he never went empty-handed, for fear the novices and lads should look to see what he had brought with him. When he went in the early morning, 
{1.227}
 he used to have rice-gruel taken up; after breakfast, ghee, butter, honey, molasses, and the like; and in the evening, he brought perfumes, garlands and cloths. So much did he expend day after day, that his expense knew no bounds. Moreover, many traders borrowed money from him on their bonds â to the amount of eighteen crores; and the great merchant never called the money in. Furthermore, another eighteen crores of the family property, which were buried in the riverbank, were washed out to sea, when the bank was swept away by a storm; and down rolled the brazen pots, with fastenings and seals unbroken, to the bottom of the ocean. In his house, too, there was always rice standing ready for 500 monks â so that the merchantâs house was to the Saá¹gha like a pool dug where four roads meet, yes, like mother and father was he to them. Therefore, even the Supreme Buddha used to go to his house, and the Eighty Chief Elders too; and the number of other monks passing in and out was beyond measure.


Now his house was seven stories high and had seven portals; and over the fourth gateway dwelt a DevatÄ who was a heretic. When the Supreme Buddha came into the house, she could not stay in her abode on high, but came down with her children to the ground-floor; and she had to do the same whenever the Eighty Chief Elders or the other elders came in and out. Thought she, âSo long as the ascetic Gotama and his disciples keep coming into this house I can have no peace here; I canât be eternally coming downstairs to the ground floor. I must contrive to stop them from coming any more to this house.â So one day, when the business manager had retired to rest, she appeared before him in visible shape.


âWho is that?â said he. âIt is I,â was the reply, âthe DevatÄ who lives over the fourth gateway.â âWhat brings you here?â âYou donât see what the merchant is doing. Heedless of his own future, he is drawing upon his resources, only to enrich the ascetic Gotama. He engages in no commerce; he undertakes no business. Advise the merchant to attend to his business, and arrange that the ascetic Gotama with his disciples shall come no more into the house.â


Then said he, âFoolish DevatÄ, if the merchant does spend his money, he spends it on the dispensation of the Buddha, which leads to safety. Even if he were to seize me by the hair and sell me for a slave, I will say nothing. Begone!â


Another day, she went to the merchantâs eldest son and gave him the same advice. And he flouted her in just the same manner. But to the merchant himself she did not so much as dare to speak on the matter.


Now by dint of unending munificence 
{1.228}
 and of doing no business, the merchantâs incomings diminished and his estate grew less and less; so that he sank by degrees into poverty, and his table, his dress, and his bed and food were no longer what they had once been. Yet, in spite of his altered circumstances, 
[1.101]
 he continued to entertain the Saá¹gha, though he was no longer able to feast them. So one day when he had made his bow and taken his seat, the Teacher said to him, âHouseholder, are gifts being given at your house?â âYes, sir,â said he, âbut thereâs only a little sour husk-porridge, left over from yesterday.â âBe not distressed, householder, at the thought that you can only offer what is unpalatable. If the heart be good, the food given to Buddhas, Paccekabuddhas, 
All Buddhas have attained to complete illumination; but a Paccekabuddha keeps his knowledge to himself and, unlike a âPerfect Buddha,â does not preach the saving truth to his fellowmen.
 and their disciples, cannot but be good too. And why? Because of the greatness of the fruit thereof. For he who can make his heart acceptable cannot give an unacceptable gift â as is to be testified by the following passage:

âFor, if the heart have faith, no gift is small

To Buddhas or to their disciples true.


âTis said no service can be reckoned small

Thatâs paid to Buddhas, lords of great renown.


Mark well what fruit rewarded that poor gift

Of pottage â dried-up, sour, and lacking salt.â 
The first two lines are from the 
VimÄnavatthu
, page 44.

Also, he said this further thing, âHouseholder, in giving this unpalatable gift, you are giving it to those who have entered on the Noble Eightfold Path. Whereas I, when in VelÄmaâs time I stirred up all JambudÄ«pa by giving the seven things of price, and in my largesse poured them forth as though I had made into one mighty stream the five great rivers â I yet found none who had reached the Three Refuges or kept the Five Precepts; for rare are those who are worthy of offerings. Therefore, let not your heart be troubled by the thought that your gift is unpalatable.â And so saying, he repeated the VelÄmakasutta [AN 9.20]. 
[Otherwise known as 
VelÄmasutta
, AN 9.20, it is one of the suttas that record a 
JÄtaka
 unknown to this collection.]


Now that DevatÄ who had not dared to speak to the merchant in the days of his magnificence, thought that now he was poor he would hearken to her, and so, entering his chamber at dead of night she appeared before him in visible shape, standing in mid-air. âWhoâs that?â said the merchant, when he became aware of her presence. âI am the DevatÄ, great merchant, who dwells over the fourth gateway.â âWhat brings you here?â âTo give you counsel.â âProceed, then.â âGreat merchant, you take no thought for your own future or for your own children. You have expended vast sums on the dispensation of the ascetic Gotama; in fact, by long-continued 
{1.229}
 expenditure and by not undertaking new business you have been brought by the ascetic Gotama to poverty. But even in your poverty you do not shake off the ascetic Gotama! The ascetics are in and out of your house this very day just the same! What they have had of you cannot be recovered. That may be taken for certain. But henceforth donât you go yourself to the ascetic Gotama and donât let his disciples set foot inside your house. Do not even turn to look at the ascetic Gotama but attend to your trade and traffic in order to restore the family estate.â Then he said to her, âWas this the counsel you wanted to give me?â âYes, it was.â


Said the merchant, âThe One with Ten Powers has made me proof against a hundred, a thousand, yes against a hundred thousand DevatÄs such as you are! My faith is strong and steadfast as Mount Sineru! My substance has been expended on the dispensation that leads to safety. Wicked are your words; it is a blow aimed at the dispensation of the Buddhas by you, you wicked and impudent wretch. I cannot live under the same roof with you; be off at once from my house and seek shelter elsewhere!â


Hearing these words of that converted man and elect disciple, she could not stay, but repairing to her dwelling, took her 
[1.102]
 children by the hand and went forth. But though she went, she was minded, if she could not find herself a lodging elsewhere, to appease the merchant and return to dwell in his house; and in this mind she went to the tutelary Devaputta of the city and with due salutation stood before him. Being asked what had brought her there, she said: âMy lord, I have been speaking imprudently to AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika, and he in his anger has turned me out of my home. Take me to him and make it up between us, so that he may let me live there again.â âBut what was it you said to the merchant?â âI told him for the future not to support the Buddha and the Saá¹gha, and not to let the ascetic Gotama set foot again in his house. This is what I said, my lord.â âWicked were your words; it was a blow aimed at the dispensation. I cannot take you with me to the merchant.â Meeting with no support from him, she went to the Four Great Kings of the world. And being repulsed by them in the same manner, she went on to Sakka, King of Devas, and told him her story, beseeching him still more earnestly, as follows, âDeva, finding no shelter, I wander about homeless, leading my children by the hand. Grant me of your majesty some place wherein to dwell.â


And he too said to her, âYou have done wickedly; it was a blow aimed at the Conquerorâs dispensation. I cannot speak to the merchant on your behalf. But I can tell you one way 
{1.230}
 whereby the merchant may be led to pardon you.â âPray tell me, Deva.â âMen have had eighteen crores of the merchant on bonds. Take the semblance of his agent, and without telling anybody repair to their houses with the bonds, in the company of some young Yakkhas. Stand in the middle of their houses with the bond in one hand and a receipt in the other, and terrify them with your Yakkha power, saying, âHereâs your acknowledgment of the debt. Our merchant did not move in the matter while he was affluent; but now he is poor, and you must pay up the money you owe.â By your Yakkha power obtain all those eighteen crores of gold and fill the merchantâs empty treasuries. He had another treasure buried in the banks of the river AciravatÄ«, but when the bank was washed away, the treasure was swept into the sea. Get that back also by your supernatural power and store it in his treasuries. Further, there is another sum of eighteen crores lying unowned in such and such a place. Bring that too and pour the money into his empty treasuries. When you have atoned by the recovery of these fifty-four crores, ask the merchant to forgive you.â âVery good, Deva,â said she. And she set to work obediently, and did just as she had been bidden. When she had recovered all the money, she went into the merchantâs chamber at dead of night and appeared before him in visible shape standing in the air.


The merchant asking who was there, she replied, âIt is I, great merchant, the blind and foolish DevatÄ who lived over your fourth gateway. In the greatness of my infatuate folly I knew not the virtues of a Buddha, and so came to say what I said to you some days ago. Pardon me my fault! At the instance of Sakka, King of Devas, I have made atonement by recovering the eighteen crores owing to you, the eighteen crores which had been washed down into the sea, and another eighteen crores which were lying unowned in such and such a place â making fifty-four crores in all, which I have poured into your empty treasure-chambers. The sum you expended on the monastery at Jetavana is now made up again. While I have nowhere to dwell, I am in misery. Bear not in mind what I did in my ignorant folly, great merchant, but pardon me.â


AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika, hearing what she said, thought to himself, âShe is a DevatÄ, and she says she has atoned, and confesses her fault. The Teacher shall consider this and make his virtues known to her. I will take her before the Supreme Buddha.â So he said: âMy good DevatÄ, if you want me to pardon you, ask me in the presence of the master.â âVery good,â said she, âI will. Take me along with you to the Teacher.â âCertainly,â said he. And early in the morning, when night was just passing away, he took her with him to the Teacher, and told the TathÄgata all that she had done.


Hearing this, the Teacher said: âYou see, householder, how the defiled man regards defilement 
{1.231}
 as excellent before it ripens to its fruit. But when it has ripened, then he sees defilements to be defiled. Likewise the good man looks on his goodness 
[1.103]
 as wrong before it ripens to its fruit; but when it ripens, he sees it to be goodness.â And so saying, he repeated these two verses from the Dhammapada [119-120]:

âThe defiled man thinks his deed is good,

So long as wrong has ripened not to fruit.

But when his wrong at last to ripeness grows,

The defiled man sees âIt was wrong I wrought.â


The good man thinks his goodness is but wrong,

So long as it has ripened not to fruit.

But when his goodness unto ripeness grows,

The good man sees that âIt was good I wrought.â â

At the close of these verses that DevatÄ was established in the Fruit of the First Path. She fell at the wheel-marked feet of the Teacher, crying, âStained as I was with passion, depraved by defilements, misled by delusion, and blinded by ignorance, I spoke wickedly because I knew not your virtues. Pardon me!â Then she received pardon from the Teacher and from the great merchant.


At this time AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika sang his own praises in the Teacherâs presence, saying: âSir, though this DevatÄ did her best to stop me from giving support to the Buddha and his following, she could not succeed; and though she tried to stop me from giving gifts, yet I gave them still! Was not this goodness on my part?â


Said the Teacher, âYou, householder, are a converted man and an elect disciple; your faith is firm and your vision is purified. No marvel then that you were not stopped by this impotent DevatÄ. The marvel was that the wise and good of a bygone day, when a Buddha had not appeared, and when knowledge had not ripened to its full fruit, should from the heart of a lotus-flower have given gifts, although MÄra, lord of the Sensual Worlds, appeared in mid-heaven, shouting, âIf you give gifts, you shall be roasted in this hell,â and showing them therewithal a pit eighty cubits deep, filled with red-hot embers.â And so saying, at the request of AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika, he told this story of the past.

Gladly will I fall head-first, or fall head over heels into hell, but I will not do anything ignoble, come, accept this rice.

Said the Teacher, âIt was no marvel, layman, that you, with your discernment of the truth, were not overcome now by the DevatÄ; the real marvel was what the wise and good did in bygone days.â His lesson ended, the Teacher showed the connection, and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThe Paccekabuddha of those days passed away, never to be born again. I was myself the Treasurer of Benares who, defeating MÄra, and standing in the heart of the lotus, placed alms in the bowl of the Paccekabuddha.â

 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana about the elder Losakatissa.


âWho,â you ask, âwas this elder Losakatissa?â Well; his father was a fisherman in Kosala, and he was the bane of his family; and, when a monk, never had anything given to him. His previous existence ended, he had been conceived by a certain fishermanâs wife in a fishing-village of a thousand families in Kosala. And on the day he was conceived all those thousand families, net in hand, went fishing in river and pool but failed to catch one single fish; and 
[1.106]
 the like bad fortune dogged them from that day forward. Also, before his birth, the village was destroyed seven times by fire, and visited seven times by the kingâs vengeance. So in time it came to pass that the people fell into a wretched plight.


Reflecting that such had not been their lot in former days, but that now they were going to rack and ruin, they concluded that there must be some breeder of misfortune among them, and resolved to divide into two bands. This they did; and there were then two bands of five hundred families each. Thence-forward, ruin dogged the band which included the parents of the future Losaka, while the other five hundred families throve apace. So the former resolved to go on halving their numbers, and did so, until this one family was parted from all the rest. Then they knew that the breeder of misfortune was in that family, and with blows drove them away. 
{1.235}


With difficulty could his mother get a livelihood; but, when her time was come, she gave birth to her son in a certain place. (He that is born into his last existence cannot be killed. For like a lamp within a jar, even so securely within his breast burns the flame of his destiny to become an Arahat.) The mother took care of the child till he could run about, and when he could run about then she put a potsherd in his hands, and, bidding him go into a house to beg, ran away. Thenceforward, the solitary child used to beg his food thereabouts and sleep where he could. He was unwashed and unkempt, and made a living after the fashion of a mud-eating Yakkha. 
On the authority of Elder SubhÅ«ti, 
paá¹supisÄcakÄ
 are said to form the fourth class of 
Petas
 (
pretas
) or âghostsâ (who were cursed at once with cavernous maws and with mouths no bigger than a needleâs eye, so that their voracity was never satisfied even in their customary coprophagic state). But neither Hardyâs 
Manual of Buddhism
 (p. 58) nor the 
Milinda
 (p. 294) mentions 
paá¹supisÄcakÄ
 as one of the four classes of 
Petas
.
 When he was seven years old, he was picking up and eating, like a crow, lump by lump, any rice he could find outside a house door where they flung away the rinsings of the rice-pots.


SÄriputta, Captain of the Dhamma, going into SÄvatthi on his round for alms, noticed the child, and, wondering what village the hapless creature came from, was filled with love for him and called out, âCome here.â The child came, bowed to the elder, and stood before him. Then said SÄriputta, âWhat village do you belong to, and where are your parents?â


âI am destitute, sir,â said the child, âfor my parents said they were tired out, and so forsook me, and went away.â


âWould you like to become a monk?â âIndeed I should, sir; but who would receive a poor wretch like me into the Saá¹gha?â âI will.â âThen, pray let me become a monk.â


The elder gave the child a meal and took him to the monastery, washed him with his own hands, and admitted him a novice first and a full monk afterwards, when he was old enough. In his old age he was known as elder Losakatissa; he was always unlucky,

 and but little was given to him. The story goes that, no matter how lavish the generosity, he never got enough to eat, but only just enough to keep himself alive. A single ladle of rice seemed to fill his alms-bowl to the brim, so that the charitable thought his bowl was full and bestowed the rest of their rice on the next. When rice was being put into his bowl, it is said that the rice in the giverâs dish used to vanish away. And so with every kind of food. Even when, as time went by, he had developed Discernment and so won the highest fruit which is Arahatship, he still got but little.


In the fullness of time, when the materials which determined his separate existence 
As protoplasm is âthe physical basis of life,â so

 are its moral basis according to Buddhist ideas. This

 were outworn, the day came for him to pass away. And the captain 
[1.107]
 of the Dhamma, as he meditated, had knowledge of this, and thought to himself, âLosakatissa will pass away today; and today at any rate I will see that he has enough to eat.â So he took the elder and came to SÄvatthi for alms. But, because Losaka was with him, it was all in vain that SÄriputta held out his hand for alms in populous SÄvatthi; not so much as a reverential bow was vouchsafed him. So he bade the elder go back and seat himself in the sitting-hall of the monastery, and collected food which he sent with a message 
{1.236}
 that it was to be given to Losaka. Those to whom he gave it took the food and went their way, but, forgetting all about Losaka, ate it themselves. So when SÄriputta rose up, and was entering the monastery, Losaka came to him and saluted him. SÄriputta stopped, and turning round said: âWell, did you get the food, monk?â


âI shall, no doubt, get it in good time,â said the elder. SÄriputta was greatly troubled, and looked to see what hour it was. But noon was passed. 
i.e.
 no more rice could be eaten that day. If a shadow of a fingerâs breadth is cast by an upright stick, a strict monk will not eat rice and like foods.
 âStay here, monk,â said SÄriputta, âand do not move,â and he made Losakatissa sit down in the sitting-hall, and set out for the palace of the king of Kosala. The king bade his bowl be taken, and saying that it was past noon and therefore not the time to eat rice, ordered his bowl to be filled with the four sweet kinds of food. 
Honey, ghee, butter, and sugar.
 With this he returned, and stood before him, bowl in hand, bidding the sage eat. But the elder was ashamed, because of the reverence he had towards Elder SÄriputta, and would not eat. âCome, monk Tissa,â said SÄriputta, â âtis I must stand with the bowl; sit you down and eat. If the bowl left my hand, everything in it would vanish away.â


So the venerable elder Losakatissa ate the sweets, while the exalted Captain of the Dhamma stood holding the bowl; and thanks to the latterâs merits and efficacy the food did not vanish. So the elder Losakatissa ate as much as he wanted and was satisfied, and that self-same day passed away by that death whereby existence ceases for ever.


The Supreme Buddha stood by, and saw the body burned; and they built a shrine for the collected ashes.


Seated in a meeting in the Dhamma Hall, the monks said: âMonks, Losaka was unlucky, and little was given to him. How came he with his unluck and his neediness to win the glory of Arahatship?â Entering the Hall, the Teacher asked what they were talking about; and they told him. âMonks,â said he, âthis monkâs own actions were the cause both of his receiving so little, and of his becoming an Arahat. In bygone days he had prevented others from receiving, and that is why he received so little himself. But it was by his meditating on suffering, impermanence, and the absence of an abiding self in things, that he became an Arahat for himself.â And so saying, he told this story of the past.

He who does not take the advice of one who seeks his good, though taught by those concerned for his welfare, grieve like Mittaka holding onto the goatâs foot.

Said the Teacher, âThis Losaka was himself the cause both of his getting little and of his getting Arahatship.â His lesson ended, he showed the connection and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThe elder Losakatissa was the Mittavindaka of those days, and I the Teacher of world-wide fame.â

## Analysis
In the present one monk is very greedy and goes from supporter to supporter collecting food. The Buddha tells how this monk was also greedy in a previous life when, as a crow, he deceived his friend the pigeon in order to get access to a kitchen, which he stole from. But there the cook caught and plucked him and left him to die.


The Bodhisatta = the pigeon (pÄrÄvata),

the greedy monk = the crow (kÄka).

âHe who does not take the advice.â
 
[1.112]
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a certain greedy monk. His greediness will be related in the Ninth Book in the KÄkajÄtaka [Ja 434]. 
[The story referred to is known as the Ja 434 
CakkavÄkajÄtaka
, a part of which I include here.]

He was, it was said, greedy after the Buddhist requisites and casting off all duties of master and pastor, entered SÄvatthi quite early, and after drinking excellent rice-gruel served with many a kind of solid food in the house of VisÄkhÄ, and after eating in the daytime various dainties, paddy, meat and boiled rice, not satisfied with this he went about thence to the house of Culla AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika, and the king of Kosala, and various others.

But on this occasion the monks told the Teacher, saying: âSir, this monk is greedy.â Said the Teacher, âIs it true 
{1.242}
 as they say, monk, that you are greedy?â âYes, sir,â was the reply. âSo too in bygone days, monk, you were greedy, and by reason of your greediness lost your life; also you caused the wise and good to lose their home.â And so saying he told this story of the past.

He who does not take the advice of one who seeks his good, though taught by those concerned for his welfare, like the one who heeded not the pigeonâs advice, he shall fall into the hands of his enemies.

Said the Teacher, âYou were greedy, monk, in bygone times, just as you are now; and all because of your greediness the wise and good of those days had to abandon their homes.â Having ended this lesson, the Teacher preached the Four Truths, at the close whereof that monk won the Fruit of the Second Path. Then the Teacher showed the connection and identified the JÄtaka as follows, âThe greedy monk was the crow of those times, and I the pigeon.â

{1.245}
 and, as the result of your refusal to follow the advice of the wise and good, you met your end by the bite of a snake.â And so saying, he told this story of the past.

He who does not take the advice of one who seeks his good, though taught by those concerned for his welfare, are in this way destroyed, like Veá¸·ukaâs father.

Said the Teacher, âMonk, this is not the first time you have shown yourself wilful; you were no less so in times gone by, and thereby met your death from a viperâs bite.â Having ended his lesson, the Teacher showed the connection and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âIn those days, this wilful monk was Veá¸·ukaâs father, my disciples were the band of disciples, and I myself their teacher.â

âBetter is a foe.â
 
[1.116]
 This story was told by the Teacher while on an alms pilgrimage in Magadha, about some stupid villagers in a certain hamlet. Tradition says that, after travelling from SÄvatthi to the kingdom of Magadha, the TathÄgata was on his rounds in that kingdom when he arrived at a certain hamlet, which was thronged with fools. In this hamlet these fools met together one day, and debated together, saying: âFriends, when we are at work in the jungle, the mosquitos devour us; and that hinders our work. Let us, arming ourselves with bows and weapons, go to war with the mosquitos and shoot them all to death.â So off to the jungle they went, and shouting, âShoot down the mosquitos,â shot and struck one another, till they were in a sad state and returned only to sink on the ground in or within the village or at its entrance.


Surrounded by the Saá¹gha of monks, the Teacher came in quest of alms to that village. The sensible minority among the inhabitants no sooner than they saw the Fortunate One, than they erected a pavilion at the entrance to their village and, after bestowing large alms on the 
{1.247}
 Saá¹gha with the Buddha at its head, bowed to the Teacher and seated themselves. Observing wounded men lying around on this side and on that, the Teacher asked those lay brothers, saying: âThere are numbers of handicapped men about; what has happened to them?â âSir,â was the reply, âthey went forth to war with the mosquitos, but only shot one another and so handicapped themselves.â Said the Teacher, âThis is not the first time that these foolish people have dealt out blows to themselves instead of to the mosquitos they meant to kill; in former times, also, there were those who, meaning to hit a mosquito, hit a fellow-creature instead.â And so saying, at those villagersâ request he told this story of the past.

Better is a foe endowed with wisdom than a friend who is lacking in wisdom, thinking: âI will kill a mosquito,â the foolish son split his fatherâs head open. 
{1.248}

âThus, lay brethren,â said the Teacher, âin bygone times also there were those who, seeking to hit a mosquito, struck down a fellow-creature.â This lesson ended, he showed the connection and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âIn those days I was myself the wise and good trader who departed after repeating the verse.â

 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a maid servant of the Lord High Treasurer, AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika. For he is said to have had a maid-servant named Rohiá¹Ä«, whose aged mother came to where the girl was pounding rice, and lay down. The flies came round the old woman and stung her as with a needle, so she cried to her daughter, âThe flies are stinging me, my dear; do drive them away.â âOh! Iâll drive them away, mother,â said the girl, lifting her pestle to the flies which had settled on her mother. Then, crying, âIâll kill them!â she smote her mother such a blow as to kill the old woman outright. Seeing what she had done the girl began to weep and cry, âOh! Mother, mother!â


The news was brought to the Lord High Treasurer, who, after having the body burnt, went his way to the monastery, and told the Teacher what had happened. âThis is not the first time, layman,â said the Teacher, âthat in Rohiá¹Ä«âs anxiety to kill the flies on her mother, she has struck her mother dead with a pestle; she did precisely the same in times past.â Then at AnÄthapiá¹á¸ikaâs request, he told this story of the past.

Worse than an intelligent foe is a fool who has compassion, look at that common girl Rohiá¹Ä«: killing her mother, she grieved.

âThis is not the first time, layman,â said the Teacher, âthat in Rohiá¹Ä«âs anxiety to kill flies she has killed her own mother instead.â This lesson ended, he showed the connection and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThe mother and daughter of today were also mother and daughter of those bygone times, and I myself the Lord High Treasurer.â

âNot with one skilled in harm.â
 This story was told by the Teacher in a certain hamlet of Kosala about one who spoiled a pleasure garden.


Tradition says that, in the course of an alms-journey among the people of Kosala, the Teacher came to a certain hamlet. A householder of the place invited the TathÄgata to take the midday meal at his house, and had his guest seated in the pleasure gardens, where he showed hospitality to the Saá¹gha with the Buddha at its head, and courteously gave them leave to stroll at will about his grounds. So the monks rose up and walked about the grounds with the gardener. Observing in their walk a bare space, they said to the gardener, âLay-disciple, elsewhere in the pleasure gardens there is abundant shade; but here thereâs neither tree nor shrub. How comes this?â


âSirs,â replied the man, âwhen these grounds were being laid out, a village lad, who was doing the watering, pulled up all the young trees hereabouts and then gave them much or little 
{1.250}
 water according to the size of their roots. So the young trees withered and died off; and that is why this space is bare.â


Drawing near to the Teacher, the monks told him this. âYes, monks,â said he, âthis is not the first time that village lad has spoiled a pleasure garden; he did precisely the same in bygone times also.â And so saying, he told this story of the past.

Not with one skilled in harm does the one who lives well find happiness, the unintelligent ruins what is good, like the monkey in the park.

Said the Teacher, âThis is not the first time, monks, that this village lad has spoiled pleasure gardens; he was just the same in bygone times also.â His lesson ended, he showed the connection and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThe village lad who spoiled this pleasure gardens was the king of the monkeys in those days, and I was myself the wise and good man.â

 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana about one who spoiled spirits. Tradition says that AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika had a friend who kept a tavern. This friend got ready a supply of strong spirits which he sold for gold and for silver, 
Apparently regarded as a cheating proceeding, as opposed to normal barter.
 and his tavern was crowded. He gave orders to his apprentice to sell for cash only, and went off himself to bathe.


This apprentice, while serving out the grog to his customers, observed them sending out for salt and jaggery and eating it as an appetizer. Thought he to himself, âThere canât be any salt in our liquor; Iâll put some in.â So he put a pound of salt in a bowl of grog, and served it out to the customers. And they no sooner took a mouthful, than they spat it out again, saying: âWhat have you been up to?â âI saw you sending for salt after drinking our liquor, so I mixed some salt in.â âAnd thatâs how youâve spoilt good liquor, you fool,â cried the customers, and with abuse they got up one after another and flung out of the tavern.


When the keeper of the tavern came home, and did not see 
{1.252}
 a single customer about, he asked where they had all got to. So the apprentice told him what had happened. Berating him for his folly, the man went off and told AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika. And the latter, thinking the story a good one to tell, repaired to Jetavana, where after due obeisance he told the Teacher all about it.


âThis is not the first time, layman,â said the Teacher, âthat this apprentice has spoiled spirits. He did just the same once before.â Then at AnÄthapiá¹á¸ikaâs request, he told this story of the past.

Not with one skilled in harm does the one who lives well find happiness, the unintelligent ruins what is good, just like Koá¹á¸aÃ±Ã±aâs liquor.

Said the Teacher, âLayman, this same person spoiled spirits in the past as now.â Then he showed the connection and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âHe who spoiled the spirits now was also the spoiler of the spirits in those bygone days, and I myself was then the Treasurer of Benares.â

 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana about a certain naked ascetic. Tradition says that a gentleman of the country near SÄvatthi asked in marriage for his son a young SÄvatthi lady of equal rank. Having fixed a day to come and fetch the bride, he subsequently consulted a naked ascetic who was intimate with his family, as to whether the stars were favourable for holding the festivities that day.


âHe didnât ask me in the first instance,â thought the indignant ascetic, âbut having already fixed the day, without consulting me, just makes an empty 
[1.125]
 reference to me now. Very good; Iâll teach him a lesson.â So he made answer that the stars were not favourable for that day; that the nuptials ought not to be celebrated that day; and that, if they were, great misfortune would come of it. And the country family in their faith in their ascetic did not go for the bride that day. Now the brideâs friends in the town had made all their preparations for celebrating the nuptials, and when they saw that the other side did not come, they said: âIt was they who fixed today, and yet they have not come; and we have gone to great expense about it all. Who are these people, forsooth? Let us marry the girl to someone else.â So they found another bridegroom and gave the girl to him in marriage with all the festivities they had already prepared.


Next day the country party came to fetch the bride. But the SÄvatthi people rated them as follows, âYou country folk are a bad lot; you fixed the day yourselves, and then insulted us by not coming. We have given the maiden to another.â The country party started a quarrel, but in the end went home the way they came.


Now the monks came to know how that naked ascetic had thwarted the festivity, and they began to talk the matter over in the Dhamma Hall. Entering the Hall, and learning on enquiry the subject of their conversation, the Teacher said: âMonks, this is not the first time that this same ascetic has thwarted the festivities of that family; out of pique with them, he did just the same thing once before.â And so saying, he told this story of the past.

While waiting on his lucky stars, benefit passes the fool by, benefit is benefitâs lucky star, what can the stars achieve?

Said the Teacher, âThis is not the first time, monks, that this naked ascetic has thwarted that familyâs festivities; he did just the same thing in bygone times also.â His lesson ended, he showed the connection and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThis ascetic 
{1.259}
 was also the ascetic of those days, and the families too were the same; I myself was the wise and good man who uttered the verse.â

âThe unintelligent.â
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about actions done for the worldâs good, as will be explained in the Twelfth Book in the MahÄkaá¹hajÄtaka [Ja 469].

One day, they say, the monks as they sat in the Dhamma Hall, were talking together. âSirs,â one would say, âthe Teacher, ever practising friendship towards the multitudes of the people, has forsaken an agreeable abode, and lives just for the good of the world. He has attained supreme wisdom, yet of his own accord takes bowl and robe, and goes on a journey of eighteen leagues or more. For the five elders he set rolling the Wheel of the Dhamma; on the fifth day of the half-month he recited the Anattalakkhaá¹a discourse, and made them Arahats; he went to Uruveá¸·a, and to the ascetics with matted hair he showed three and a half thousand miracles, and persuaded them to join the Saá¹gha; at GayÄsÄ«sa he taught the Discourse upon Fire, and made a thousand of these ascetics Arahats; to MahÄkassapa, when he had gone forward three miles to meet him, after three discourses he gave the higher ordination; all alone, after the noon-day meal, he went a journey of forty-five leagues, and then established in the Fruit of the Third Path Pukkusa (a youth of very good birth); to meet MahÄkappina he went forward a space of two thousand leagues, and made him an Arahat; alone, in the afternoon he went a journey of thirty leagues, and made that cruel and harsh man Aá¹gulimÄla an Arahat; thirty leagues also he traversed, and established Äá¸·avaka in the Fruit of the First Path, and saved the prince; in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three he dwelt three months, and taught Abhidhamma to eight hundred millions of deities; to the Brahma Realm he went, and destroyed the false Dhamma of Baka Brahma, and made ten thousand Brahmas Arahats; every year he goes on pilgrimage in three districts, and to such men as are capable of receiving, he gives the Refuges, the Precepts, and the Fruits of the different stages; he even acts for the good of NÄgas and Garuá¸·as and the like, in many ways.â


In such words they praised the goodness and worth of the One with Ten Powersâ life for the good of the world. The Teacher came in, and asked what they talked about as they sat there? They told him. âAnd no wonder, monks,â said he. âI who now in my perfect wisdom would live for the worldâs good, even I in the past, in the days of passion, lived for the good of the world.â So saying, he told a story of the past.

The unintelligent by the thousand begged me for sacrifice, now I will make a sacrifice of many unrighteous people. 
{1.261}

Said the Teacher, âThis is not the first time, monks, that the TathÄgata has acted for the worldâs good; he acted in like manner in bygone times as well.â His lesson ended, he showed the connection and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThe Buddhaâs disciples were the ministers of those days, and I myself was the king of Benares.â

âThe dishes are still full.â
 
[1.134]
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about some drugged liquor.


In the past the drunkards of SÄvatthi met to take counsel, saying: âWeâve not got the price of a drink left; how are we to get it?â âCheer up!â said one ruffian, âIâve a little plan.â âWhat may that be?â cried the others.


âItâs AnÄthapiá¹á¸ikaâs custom,â said the fellow, âto wear his rings and richest attire, when going to wait upon the king. Let us doctor some liquor with a stupefying drug and fit up a drinking-booth, in which we will all be sitting when AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika passes by. âCome and join us, Lord High Treasurer,â weâll cry, and ply him with our liquor till he loses his senses. Then let us relieve him of his rings and clothes, and get the price of a drink.â


His plan mightily pleased the other rogues, and was duly carried out. As AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika was returning, they went out to meet him and invited him 
{1.269}
 to come along with them; for they had got some rare liquor, and he must taste it before he went.


âWhat?â he thought, âshall a believer, who has found emancipation, touch strong drink? Howbeit, though I have no craving for it, yet will I expose these rogues.â So into their booth he went, where their proceedings soon showed him that their liquor was drugged; and he resolved to make the rascals take to their heels. So he roundly charged them with doctoring their liquor with a view to drugging strangers first and robbing then afterwards. âYou sit in the booth you have opened, and you praise up the liquor,â said he, âbut as for drinking it, not one of you ventures on that. If it is really undrugged, drink away at it yourselves.â This summary exposure made the gang take to their heels, and AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika went off home. Thinking he might as well tell the incident to the TathÄgata, he went to Jetavana and related the story.


âThis time, layman,â said the Teacher, âit is you whom these rogues have tried to trick; so too in the past they tried to trick the good and wise of those days.â So saying, at his hearerâs request, he told this story of the past.

The dishes are still full, while the talk is about something other, for this reason I know that this spirit cannot have excellence. 
{1.270}

His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThe rascals of today were also the rascals of those bygone days; and I myself was then Treasurer of Benares.â

âThis tree is not hard to climb up.â
 This was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a lay brother who was skilled in the knowledge of fruits. It appears that a certain householder of SÄvatthi had invited the Saá¹gha with the Buddha at their head, and had seated them in his pleasure gardens, where they were regaled with rice-gruel and cakes. Afterwards he bade his gardener go round with the monks and give mangoes and other kinds of fruits to the venerables. In obedience to orders, the man walked about the grounds with the monks, and could tell by a single glance up at the tree what fruit was green, what nearly ripe, and what quite ripe, and so on. And what he said was always found true. So the monks came to the TathÄgata and mentioned how expert the gardener was, and how, while himself standing on the ground, he could accurately tell the condition of the hanging fruit. âMonks,â said the Teacher, âthis gardener is not the only one who has had knowledge of fruits. A like knowledge was shown by the wise and good of former days also.â And so saying, he told this story of the past.

This tree is not hard to climb up, nor is it far from the village, for this reason I know that this tree does not have delicious fruit.

âThus, monks,â said the Teacher, âin bygone days the wise and good were experts in fruit.â His lesson ended, he showed the connection and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThe Buddhaâs followers were then the people of the caravan, and I myself was the caravan leader.â

Or perhaps

 and became a monk. His teachers and masters proceeded to instruct him in the whole of the Ten Precepts of Morality, one after the other, expounded to him the Short, the Medium, and the Long Moralities, 
These are translated in Rhys Davidsâ 
Buddhist Suttas
, pp. 189-200.
 set forth the morality which rests on self-restraint according to the PÄtimokkha,

 Vol. 13).
 the morality which rests on self-restraint as to the Senses, the morality which rests on a blameless walk of life, the morality which relates to the way a monk may use the Requisites. Thought the young beginner, âThere is a tremendous lot of this morality; and I shall undoubtedly fail to fulfil all I have vowed. Yet what is the good of being a monk at all, if one cannot keep the rules of morality? My best course is to go back to the world, take a wife and rear children, living a life of generosity and other good works.â So he told his superiors what he thought, saying that he proposed to return to the lower state of a layman, and wished to hand back his bowl and robes. âWell, if it be so with you,â they said, âat least take leave of the One with Ten Powers before you go,â and they brought the young man before the Teacher in the Dhamma Hall.


âWhy, monks,â said the Teacher, âare you bringing this monk to me against his will?â


âSir, he said that morality was more than he could observe, and wanted to give back his robes and bowl. So we took him and brought him to you.â


âBut why, monks,â asked the Teacher, âdid you burden him with so much? He can do what he can, but no more. Do not make this mistake again, and leave me to decide what should be done in the case.â


Then, turning to the young monk, the Teacher said: âCome, monk; what concern have you with morality in the mass? Do you think you could obey just three moral rules?â


âOh, yes, sir.â


âWell now, watch and guard the three avenues of the voice, the mind, and the body; do no evil whether in word, or thought, or act. Cease not to be a monk, but go hence and obey just these three rules.â


âYes, indeed, sir, I will keep them,â here exclaimed the glad young man, and back he went with his teachers again. And as he was keeping his three rules, he thought within himself, âI had the whole of morality told me by my instructors; but because they were not the Buddha, they could not make me grasp even this much. Whereas 
{1.277}
 the Fully Awakened One, by reason of his Buddhahood, and of his being the Lord of Dhamma, has expressed so much morality in only three rules concerning the avenues, and has made me understand it clearly. Verily, a very present help has the Teacher been to me.â And 
[1.141]
 he won Insight and in a few days attained Arahatship.


When this came to the ears of the monks, they spoke of it when met together in the Dhamma Hall, telling how the monk, who was going back to the world because he could not hope to fulfil morality, had been furnished by the Teacher with three rules embodying the whole of morality, and had been made to grasp those three rules, and so had been enabled by the Teacher to win Arahatship. How marvellous, they cried, was the Buddha. Entering the Hall at this point, and learning on enquiry the subject of their talk, the Teacher said: âMonks, even a heavy burden becomes light, if taken piecemeal; and thus the wise and good of past times, on finding a huge mass of gold too heavy to lift, first broke it up and then were enabled to bear their treasure away piece by piece.â So saying, he told this story of the past.

His lesson ended, the Teacher, after Fully Awakening, recited this verse: 
{1.278}

That person who has a cheerful heart, who is cheerful in his mind,  who cultivates wholesome thoughts, in order to attain safety, gradually arrives at the destruction of all of the fetters.

And when the Teacher had thus led his teaching up to Arahatship as its crowning point, he showed the connection and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âIn those days I myself was the man who got the nugget of gold.â

{1.285}
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a monk overcome by passion. The Birth Story of the Present will be related in the UmmadantijÄtaka [Ja 527].

The story tells that one day, as he was going his rounds in SÄvatthi for alms, he saw a woman of surpassing beauty, magnificently attired, and fell in love with her, and on returning home to his monastery he was unable to divert his thoughts from her. From that time, as it were, pierced with loveâs shafts and sick with desire he became as lean as a wild deer, with his veins standing out on his body, and as sallow as sallow could be. He no longer took delight in any one of the Four Postures, or found pleasure in his own thoughts, but giving up all the services due to a teacher he abandoned the use of instruction, inquiry and meditation.


His fellow-monks said: âSir, once you were calm in mind and serene of countenance, but now it is not so. What can be the cause?â they asked. âSirs,â he answered, âI have no pleasure in anything.â Then they bade him be happy, saying: âTo be born [in the time of] a Buddha is a hard matter: so also is the hearing of the True Dhamma, and the attaining to birth as a human being. But you have attained to this, and, yearning to put an end to sorrow, you left your weeping kinsfolk and becoming a believer adopted the ascetic life. Why then do you now fall under the sway of passion? These evil passions are common to all ignorant creatures, from live worms upwards, and such of these passions as are material in their origin, they too are insipid. Desires are full of sorrow and despair: misery in this case ever increases more and more. Desire is like a skeleton or a piece of meat. Desire is like a torch made of a wisp of hay or a light from embers. Desire vanishes like a dream or a loan, or the fruit of a tree. Desire is as biting as a sharp-pointed spear, or as a serpentâs head. But you, verily, after embracing such a Buddhaâs dispensation as this and becoming an ascetic, have now fallen under the sway of such harmful passions.â When by their admonitions they failed to make him grasp their teaching, they brought him before the Teacher in the Dhamma Hall. And when he said: âWhy, monks, have you brought this monk here against his will?â they answered, âThey tell us, he is discontent.â

But to this monk the Teacher said: âWomen, monk, are lustful, profligate, vile, and degraded. Why be overcome by passion for a vile woman?â And so saying, he told this story of the past.
 [1.148]

Those known as free, worldly women, there is no restriction for them, obsessed and arrogant, like a fire that feeds on everything. Having renounced them I go forth, nurturing solitude. 
{1.289}

âSo you see, monk,â said the Teacher, âhow lustful, vile, and how much woe women bring.â And after declaring the wickedness of women, he preached the Four Truths, at the close whereof that monk won the Fruit of the First Path. Lastly, the Teacher showed the connection and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âKÄpilÄnÄ« 
Her history is given in 
JRAS
 1893, page 786. [As KÄpilÄnÄ« was well-known for her celibacy and renunciation, it seems odd indeed that she should have been cast as the mother here.]

âWomen are angry, ungrateful.â
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about another monk overcome by passion. When on being questioned the monk confessed that he was overcome by passion, the Teacher said: âWomen are ingrates and treacherous; why are you overcome by passion because of them?â And he told this story of the past.
 [1.156]

After telling these two stories, the Teacher showed the connection, by reciting, after Fully Awakening, this verse:

Women are angry, ungrateful, slanderers, those who break up friends, live the spiritual life, monk, you should not give up happiness. 
{1.299}




toggle word commentary






In this connection, this is the substance of it: 
Monk
, these women are known as 
angry
, they are not able to restrain the anger that has arisen.


Ungrateful
, they do not acknowledge even great help.


Slanderers
, they speak saying something that is empty of affection.


Those who break up friends
, they break up friends, speaking in such a way as to break up friends, these are endowed with such bad thoughts.


This is why you, because of this, must 
live the spiritual life, monk
, therefore, abandoning sexual activity, through being established in purity, live what is called the spiritual life.


You should not give up happiness
, you, living the spiritual life, not giving up the happiness in the absorptions, paths and fruits, this is the happiness you should not give up, you will not be deprived of these happinesses, this is the meaning.


Na parihÄhisi
, not be deprived is also a reading, 
It is not clear where we could take the alternative reading offered. Does it mean instead of reading 
etasmÄ sukhÄ na parihÄyissasi
, we could read 
etasmÄ sukhÄ na parihÄhisi
? Or is to be applied to the verse, and instead of 
so sukhaá¹ na vihÄhasi
 we could read 
so sukhaá¹ na parihÄhisi
? 
PÄá¹­ha
 normally seems to apply to the canonical reading, but I am not sure here. 
 this is the meaning.

His lesson ended, the Teacher preached the Truths, at the close whereof the monk overcome by passion won the Fruit of the First Path. Also, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka by saying: âÄnanda was the robber-chief of those days, and I myself the Date Sage.â

## Full Story
âDo not rejoice, thinking: She desires me.â
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a lay brother. Tradition says that there dwelt at SÄvatthi a lay brother, who was established in the Three Jewels and the Five Precepts, a devout lover of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Saá¹gha. But his wife was a sinful and wicked woman. On days when she did wrong, she was as meek as a slave girl bought for a hundred pieces; while on days when she did not do 
[1.159]
 wrong, she played the lady, passionate and tyrannical. The husband could not make her out. She worried him so much that he did not go to wait on the Buddha.


One day he went with perfumes and flowers, and had taken his seat after due salutation, when the Teacher said to him, âPray how comes it, lay brother, that seven or eight days have gone by without your coming to wait upon the Buddha?â âMy wife, sir, is one day like a slave girl bought for a hundred pieces, while another day finds her like a passionate and tyrannical mistress. I cannot make her out; and it is because she has worried me so that I have not been to wait upon the Buddha.â


Now, when he heard these words, the Teacher said: âWhy, lay brother, you have already been told by the wise and good of bygone days that it is hard to understand the nature of women.â And he went on to add, âBut his previous existences have come to be confused in his mind, so that he cannot remember.â And so saying, he told this story of the past.

Do not rejoice, thinking: âShe desires me,â do not grieve, thinking: âShe doesnât desire me,â women are difficult to understand, they move around like a fish in water. 
[1.160]
 
{1.301}

His lesson ended, the Teacher preached the Truths, at the close whereof the lay brother won the Fruit of the First Path. Then the Teacher showed the connection and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThis husband and wife were also the husband and wife of those days, and I myself the teacher.â

âJust like rivers and highways.â
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about just such another lay brother as the last. This man, when on enquiry he assured himself of his wifeâs misconduct, came to words with her, with the result that he was so upset that for seven or eight days he failed in his attendance. One day he came to the monastery, made his bow to the TathÄgata and took his seat. Being asked why he had been absent for seven or eight days, he replied, âSir, my wife has committed adultery, and I have been so upset about her that I did not come.â


âLay brother,â said the Teacher, âlong ago the wise and good told you not to be angered at the naughtiness found in women, but to preserve your equanimity this, however, you have forgotten, because a multitude of rebirths has hidden it from you.â And so saying, he told â at that lay brotherâs request â this story of the past.

Just like rivers and highways, taverns, assembly halls and cisterns, so are women in the world â the wise do not get angry with them.

His lesson ended, the Teacher preached the Truths, at the close whereof the lay brother won the Fruit of the First Path. Also the Teacher showed the connection and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThis husband and wife were also the husband and wife of those days, and I myself the brahmin teacher.â

And how she cured him, so that he returned to the higher life.

## Full Story
âBefore, not having Mudulakkhaá¹Ä.â
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about sensual desire. Tradition says that a young gentleman of SÄvatthi, 
{1.303}
 on hearing the Dhamma preached by the Teacher, gave his heart to the dispensation. Renouncing the world for the monkâs life, he rose to walk in the Paths, to practise meditation, and never to slacken in his pondering over the meditation subject he had chosen. One day, while he was on his round for alms through SÄvatthi, he espied a woman in revealing clothes, and, for pleasureâs sake, broke through the higher morality and gazed upon her! Passion was stirred within him, he became even as a fig tree felled by the axe. From that day forth, under the sway of passion, the palate of his mind, as of his body, lost all its gust; like a brute beast, he took no joy in the dispensation, and suffered his nails and hair to grow long and his robes to grow foul.


When his friends among the monks became aware of his troubled state of mind, they said: âWhy, sir, is your moral state otherwise than it was?â âMy joy has gone,â said he. Then they took him to the Teacher, who asked them why they had brought that monk there against his will. âBecause, sir, his joy is gone,â âIs that true, monk?â âIt is, Fortunate One.â âWho has troubled you?â âSir, I was on my round for alms when, violating the higher morality, I gazed on a woman; and passion was stirred within me. Therefore am I 
[1.162]
 troubled.â Then said the Teacher, âIt is little marvel, monk, that when, violating morality, you were gazing for pleasureâs sake on an exceptional object, you were stirred by passion. Why, in bygone times, even those who had won the five Super Knowledges and the eight Attainments, those who by the power of Absorption had quelled their passions, whose hearts were purified and whose feet could walk the skies, yes even Bodhisattas, through gazing in violation of morality on an exceptional object, lost their Absorption, were stirred by passion, and came to great sorrow. Little recks the wind which could overturn Mount Sineru, of a bare hillock no bigger than an elephant; little recks a wind which could uproot a mighty Jambu tree, of a bush on the face of a cliff; and little recks a wind which could dry up a vast ocean, of a tiny pond. If passion could breed folly in the supremely-intelligent and pure-minded Bodhisattas, shall passion be abashed before you? Why, even purified beings are led astray by passion, and those advanced to the highest honour, come to shame.â And so saying, he told this story of the past.

Before, not having Mudulakkhaá¹Ä, I had but one desire, when I had gained her of wide eyes, desire after desire was born.

His lesson ended, the Teacher preached the Truths, at the close whereof that monk became an Arahat itself. Also the Teacher showed the connection and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âÄnanda was the king of those days, Uppalavaá¹á¹Ä was Mudulakkhaá¹Ä, and I the ascetic.â

âKing, I can bring a son to my lap.â
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a certain country-woman.


For it fell out once in Kosala that three men were ploughing on the outskirts of a certain forest, and that robbers plundered folk in that forest and made their escape. 
{1.307}
 The victims came, in the course of a fruitless search for the rascals, to where the three men were ploughing. âHere are the forest robbers, 
[1.165]
 disguised as husbandmen,â they cried, and hauled the trio off as prisoners to the king of Kosala. Now time after time there came to the kingâs palace a woman who with loud lamentations begged for âwherewith to be covered.â Hearing her cry, the king ordered a shift to be given her; but she refused it, saying this was not what she meant. So the kingâs servants came back to his majesty and said that what the woman wanted was not clothes but a husband. 
cf. â
femme couverte
.â
 Then the king had the woman brought into his presence and asked her whether she really did mean a husband.


âYes, sire,â she answered, âfor a husband is a womanâs real covering, and she that lacks a husband â even though she be clad in garments costing a thousand pieces â goes bare and naked indeed.â


(And to enforce this truth, the following discourse should be recited here:

âLike kingless kingdoms, like a stream run dry,

So bare and naked is a woman seen,

Who, having brothers ten, yet lacks a mate.â) 
[JA. 547, vs. 190.]

Pleased with the womanâs answer, the king asked what relation the three prisoners were to her. And she said that one was her husband, one her brother, and one her son. âWell, to mark my favour,â said the king, âI give you one of the three. Which will you take?â âSire,â was her answer, âif I live, I can get another husband and another son; but as my parents are dead, I can never get another brother. So give me my brother, sire.â Pleased with the woman, the king set all three men at liberty; and thus this one woman was the means of saving three persons from peril.


When the matter came to the knowledge of the Saá¹gha, they were lauding the woman in the Dhamma Hall, when the Teacher entered. Learning on enquiry what was the subject of their talk, he said: âThis is not the first time, monks, that this woman has saved those three from peril; she did the same in days gone by.â And, so saying, he told this story of the past.

King, I can bring a son to my lap, and a husband from the path, but I donât see the country from which I can bring back a brother.

âSo you see, monks,â said the Teacher, âthat this same woman once before saved these same three men from peril.â His lesson ended, he made the connection and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThe woman and the three men of today were also the woman and men of those bygone days; and I was then the king.â

âIn whom the mind is established.â
 This story was told by the Teacher, while at AÃ±janavana, about a certain brahmin. Tradition says that when the Fortunate One with his disciples was entering the city of SÄketa, an old brahmin of that place, who was going out, met him in the gateway. Falling at the One with Ten Powersâ feet, and clasping him by the ankles, the old man cried, âSon, is it not the duty of children to cherish the old age of their parents? 
{1.309}
 Why have you not let us see you all this long time? At last I have seen you; come, let your mother see you too.â So saying, he took the Teacher with him to his house; and there the Teacher sat upon the seat prepared for him, with his disciples around him. Then came the brahminâs wife, and she too fell at the feet of the Fortunate One, crying, âMy son, where have you been all this time? Is it not the duty of children to comfort their parents in their old age?â Hereon, she called to her sons and daughters that their brother was come, and made them salute the Buddha. And in their joy the aged pair showed great hospitality to their guests. After his meal, the Teacher recited to the old people the Sutta concerning old-age; 
[Snp 4.6 
JarÄsutta
].
 and, when he had ended, both husband and wife won fruition of the Second Path. Then rising up from his seat, the Teacher went back to AÃ±janavana.


Meeting together in the Dhamma Hall, the monks fell to talking about this thing. It was urged that the brahmin must have been well aware that Suddhodana was the father, and MahÄmÄyÄ the mother, of the Buddha; yet none the less, he and his wife had claimed the TathÄgata as their own son â and that with the Teacherâs assent. What could it all mean? Hearing their talk, the Teacher said: âMonks, the aged pair were right in claiming me as their son.â And so saying, he told this story of the past.

And therewithal, having told of these 3000 births, the Teacher, after Fully Awakening, recited this verse:

In whom the mind is established, in whom the heart has confidence, in that person unseen before, in him too he gladly trusts. 
{1.310}

His lesson ended, the Teacher showed the connection and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThis brahmin and his wife were the husband and wife in all those existences, and I the child.â

âCursed be that poison I emitted.â
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana about SÄriputta, the Captain of the Dhamma. Tradition says that in the days when the elder used to eat meal-cakes, folks came to the monastery with a quantity of such cakes for the Saá¹gha. After the monks had all eaten their fill, much remained over; and the givers said: âSirs, take some for those too who are away in the village.â


Just then a youth who was the elderâs co-resident, was away in the village. For him a portion was taken; but, as he did not return, and it was felt that it was getting very late, 
i.e.
 close on to mid-day, after which the food could not properly be eaten. See note, page 107.
 this portion was given to the elder. When this portion had been eaten by the elder, the youth came in. Accordingly, the elder explained the case to him, saying: âSir, I have eaten the cakes set apart for you.â âAh!â was the rejoinder, âwe have all of us got a sweet tooth.â The great elder was much troubled.


âFrom this day forward,â he exclaimed, âI vow never to eat meal-cakes again.â And from that day forward, so tradition says, the elder SÄriputta never touched meal-cakes again! This abstention became matter of common knowledge in the Saá¹gha, and the monks sat talking of it in the Dhamma Hall. Said the Teacher, âWhat are you talking of, monks, as you sit here?â When they had told him, he said: âMonks, when SÄriputta has once given anything up, he never goes back to it again, even though his life be at stake.â And so saying, he told this story of the past.

Cursed be that poison I emitted, even for the sake of life will I take back that vomit? Better is death for me than life.

## Full Story
âThat victory isnât a good victory.â
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about the elder named CittahatthasÄriputta. He is said to have been a youth of a good family in SÄvatthi; and one day, on his way home from ploughing, he turned in to the monastery. Here he received from the bowl of a certain elder some dainty fare, rich and sweet, which made him think to himself, âDay and night I am toiling away with my hands at divers tasks, yet never do I taste food 
[1.169]
 so sweet. I must become a monk myself!â So he joined the Saá¹gha, but after six weeksâ improper attention, fell under the dominion of sensual desires and off he went.


His belly again proving too much for him, 
{1.312}
 back he came to join the Saá¹gha once more, and studied the Abhidhamma. 
The third, and latest, of the 
Piá¹­akas
 â a systemisation the 
NikÄyas
 of the 
Suttapiá¹­aka
.
 In this way, six times he left and came back again; but when for the seventh time he became a monk, he mastered the whole seven books of the Abhidhamma, and by much chanting of the Dhamma he won insight and attained to Arahatship. Now his friends among the monks scoffed at him, saying: âCan it be, sir, that sensual desires have ceased to spring up within your heart?â


âSirs,â was the reply, âI have now got beyond mundane life henceforth.â


He having thus became an Arahat, talk thereof arose in the Dhamma Hall, as follows, âSirs, though all the while he was destined to all the glories of Arahatship, yet six times did CittahatthasÄriputta renounce the Saá¹gha; truly, very wrong is the unconverted state.â


Returning to the Hall, the Teacher asked what they were talking about. Being told, he said: âMonks, the worldlingâs heart is light and hard to curb; material things attract and hold it fast; when once it is so held fast, it cannot be released in a trice. Excellent is the mastery of such a heart; once mastered, it brings joy and happiness:

â âTis good to tame a wilful heart and frail,

By passion swayed. Once tamed, the heart brings bliss.â 
[Dhp 35.]

It was by reason of this wilful quality of the heart, however, that, for the sake of a pretty spade which they could not bring themselves to throw away, the wise and good of bygone days six times reverted to the world out of sheer cupidity; but on the seventh occasion they won Absorption and subdued their greed.â And so saying, he told this story of the past.

That victory isnât a good victory, that victory which can be undone, that victory is a good victory, that victory which canât be undone.
 
{1.314}

His lesson ended, he preached the Truths, at the close whereof some won the First, some the Second, and some the Third Path, while others again attained to Arahatship. Further, the Teacher showed the connection and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âÄnanda was the king of those days, the Buddhaâs followers were the followers, and I myself was KuddÄla.â

## Full Story
âOne who before had duties.â
 
[1.172]
 
{1.316}
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about the elder named Tissa the householderâs son. Tradition says that one day thirty young gentlemen of SÄvatthi, who were all friends of one another, took perfumes and flowers and robes, and set out with a large retinue to Jetavana, in order to hear the Teacher preach.


After arriving at Jetavana, they sat awhile in the several enclosures â in the enclosure of the Ironwood trees, in the enclosure of the SÄl trees, and so forth â till at evening the Teacher passed from his fragrant sweet-smelling perfumed chamber to the Dhamma Hall and took his seat on the gorgeous Buddha-seat. Then, with their following, these young men went to the Dhamma Hall, made an offering of perfumes and flowers, bowed down at his feet â those blessed feet that were glorious as full-blown lotus-flowers, and bore imprinted on the sole the Wheel â and, taking their seats, listened to the Dhamma. Then the thought came into their minds, âLet us take the vows, so far as we understand the Dhamma preached by the Teacher.â Accordingly, when the Fortunate One left the Hall, they approached him and with due obeisance asked to be admitted to the Saá¹gha; and the Teacher admitted them to the Saá¹gha.


Winning the favour of their teachers and preceptors they received full ordination, and after five yearsâ residence with their teachers and preceptors, by which time they had got by heart the two Abstracts, 
[i.e both PÄtimokkhas, or regulations for monks and nuns.]
 had come to know what was proper and what was improper, had learned the three modes of expressing thanks, and had stitched and dyed robes.


At this stage, wishing to embrace the ascetic life, they obtained the consent of their teachers and preceptors, and approached the TathÄgata. Bowing before him they took their seats, saying: âSir, we are troubled by the round of existence, dismayed by birth, decay, disease, and death; give us a meditation theme, by thinking on which we may get free from the elements which occasion existence.â The Teacher turned over in his mind the thirty-eight themes of meditation, and therefrom selected a suitable one, which he expounded to them. And then, after getting their meditation from the Teacher, they bowed and with a ceremonious farewell passed from his presence to their cells, and after gazing on their teachers and preceptors went forth with bowl and robe to embrace the ascetic life.


Now amongst them was a monk named the elder Kuá¹­umbikaputtatissa [Tissa the householderâs son], a weak and irresolute man, a slave to the pleasures of taste. Thought he to himself, âI shall never be able to live in the forest, to strive with strenuous effort, and subsist on doles of food. What is the good of my going? I will turn back.â And so he gave up, and after accompanying those monks some way he turned back.


As to the other monks, they came in the course of their alms pilgrimage through Kosala to a certain border-village, 
{1.317}
 nearby which in a wooded spot they kept the Rainy-season, and by three monthsâ striving and wrestling got the germ of Discernment and became an Arahat, making the earth shout for joy. At the end of the Rainy-season, after celebrating the Invitation festival, they set out thence to announce to the Teacher the Attainments they had won, and, coming in due course to Jetavana, laid aside their bowls and robes, paid a visit to their teachers and preceptors, and, being anxious to see the TathÄgata, went to him and with due obeisance took their seats. The Teacher greeted them kindly and they announced to the Fortunate One the Attainments they had won, receiving praise from him. Hearing the Teacher speaking in their praise, the elder Tissa the householderâs son was filled with a desire to live the life of a recluse all by himself. Likewise, those other monks asked and received the Teacherâs permission to return to dwell in that self-same spot in the forest. And with due obeisance they went to their cells.
 [1.173]


Now the elder Tissa the householderâs son that very night was inflated with a yearning to begin his austerities at once, and while practising with excessive zeal and ardour the methods of a recluse and sleeping in an upright posture by the side of his plank-bed, soon after the middle watch of the night, round he turned and down he fell, breaking his thigh-bone; and severe pains set in, so that the other monks had to nurse him and were debarred from leaving.


Accordingly, when they appeared at the hour for waiting on the Buddha, he asked them whether they had not yesterday asked his leave to start today.


âYes, sir, we did; but our friend the elder Tissa the Householderâs Son, while rehearsing the methods of a recluse with great vigour but out of season, dropped off to sleep and fell over, breaking his thigh; and that is why our departure has been thwarted.â âThis is not the first time, monks,â said the Teacher, âthat this manâs discontent has caused him to strive with unseasonable zeal, and thereby to delay your departure; he delayed your departure in the past also.â And hereupon, at their request, he told this story of the past.

One who before had duties, and later still desires to do them, like the one who broke off the Varuá¹a branch, regrets it later.

Said the Teacher, âThis is not the first time, monks, that this man has thwarted you; he did the like in the past also.â His lesson ended, he showed the connection and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThe monk who has broken his thigh was the young brahmin of those days who hurt his eye; the Buddhaâs followers were the rest of the young brahmins; and I myself was the brahmin their master.â

âWell done the numerous relatives.â
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a quarrel concerning water which had brought woe upon his kinsfolk. Knowing of this, he passed through the air, sat cross-legged above the river Rohiá¹Ä«, and emitted rays of darkness, startling his kinsfolk. Then descending from mid-air, he seated himself on the riverbank and told this story with reference to that quarrel. (Only a summary is given here; the full details will be related in the Kuá¹ÄlajÄtaka [Ja 536].) But on this occasion the Teacher addressed his kinsfolk, 
{1.328}
 saying: âIt is meet, sire, that kinsfolk should dwell together in concord and unity. For, when kinsfolk are at one, enemies find no opportunity. Not to speak of human beings, even sense-lacking trees ought to stand together. For in bygone days in the HimÄlayas a tempest struck a SÄl-forest; yet, because the trees, shrubs, bushes, and creepers of that forest were interlaced one with another, the tempest could not overthrow even a single tree but passed harmlessly over their heads. But alone in a courtyard stood a mighty tree; and though it had many stems and branches, yet, because it was not united with other trees, the tempest uprooted it and laid it low. Wherefore, it is meet that you too should dwell together in concord and unity.â And so saying, at their request he told this story of the past.
 [1.182]

Well done the numerous relatives, trees born in the wilderness, the wind carries off one alone, even the great lord of the wood.

And the Teacher went on to say, âThus, sire, reflect how meet it is that kinsfolk at any rate should be united, and lovingly dwell together in concord and unity.â His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThe Buddhaâs followers were the fairies of those days, and I myself the wise DevatÄ.â

## Full Story
âThunder, Pajjuna.â
 
[1.183]
 This story the Teacher told while at Jetavana, about the rain he caused to fall. For in those days, so it is said, there fell no rain in Kosala; the crops withered; and everywhere the ponds, tanks, and lakes dried up. Even the pool of Jetavana by the embattled gateway of Jetavana gave out; and the fish and turtles buried themselves in the mud. Then came the crows and hawks with their lance-like beaks, and busily picked them out writhing and wriggling, and devoured them.


As he marked how the fishes and the turtles were being destroyed, the Teacherâs heart was moved with compassion, and he exclaimed, âThis day 
{1.330}
 must I cause rain to fall.â So, when the night grew day, after attending to his bodily needs, he waited till it was the proper hour to go the round in quest of alms, and then, girt round by a host of the monks, and perfect with the perfection of a Buddha, he went into SÄvatthi for alms. On his way back to the monastery in the afternoon from his round for alms in SÄvatthi, he stopped upon the steps leading down to the tank of Jetavana, and thus addressed the elder Änanda, âBring me a bathing-dress, Änanda; for I would bathe in the tank of Jetavana.â âBut surely, sir,â replied the elder, âthe water is all dried up, and only mud is left.â âGreat is a Buddhaâs power, Änanda. Go, bring me the bathing-dress,â said the Teacher. So the elder went and brought the bathing-dress, which the Teacher donned, using one end to go round his waist, and covering his body up with the other. So clad, he took his stand upon the tank-steps, and exclaimed, âI would willingly bathe in the tank of Jetavana.â


That instant the yellow-stone throne of Sakka grew hot beneath him, and he sought to discover the cause. Realising what was the matter, he summoned the king of the Storm-Clouds, and said: âThe Teacher is standing on the steps of the tank of Jetavana, and wishes to bathe. Make haste and pour down rain in a single torrent over all the kingdom of Kosala.â Obedient to Sakkaâs command, the king of the Storm-Clouds clad himself in one cloud as an under garment, and another cloud as an outer garment, and chanting the rain-song, he darted forth eastward. And lo! he appeared in the east as a cloud of the size of a threshing-floor, which grew and grew till it was as big as a hundred, as a thousand, threshing-floors; and he thundered and lightened, and bending down his face and mouth deluged all Kosala with torrents of rain. Unbroken was the downpour, quickly filling the tank of Jetavana, and stopping only when the water was level with the topmost step. Then the Teacher bathed in the tank, and coming up out of the water donned his two orange-coloured cloths and his girdle, adjusting his Buddha-robe around him so as to leave one shoulder bare. In this guise he set forth, surrounded by the monks, and passed into his Perfumed Chamber, fragrant with sweet-smelling flowers. Here on the Buddha-seat he sat, and when the monks had performed their duties, he rose and exhorted the Saá¹gha from the jewelled steps of his throne, and dismissed them from his presence. Passing now within his own sweet-smelling chamber, he stretched himself, lion-like, upon his right side.


At even, the monks gathered together in the Dhamma Hall, and dwelt on the forbearance and loving-kindness of the Teacher. âWhen the crops were withering, when the pools were drying up, and the fishes and turtles were in grievous plight, then did he in his compassion come forth as a saviour. Donning a bathing-dress, he stood on the steps of the tank of Jetavana, and in a little 
[1.184]
 space made the rain to pour down from the heavens till it seemed like to overwhelm all Kosala with its torrents. And by the time he returned to the monastery, he had freed all alike from their tribulations both of mind and body.â 
{1.331}


So ran their talk when the Teacher came forth from his Perfumed Chamber into the Dhamma Hall, and asked what was their theme of conversation; and they told him. âThis is not the first time, monks,â said the Teacher, âthat the TathÄgata has made the rain to fall in the hour of general need. He did the like when born into the brute-creation, in the days when he was king of the fish.â And so saying, he told this story of the past:

Thunder, Pajjuna, destroy the trove of the crows, oppress the crow with grief, free me and mine from grief.

âSo this is not the first time, monks,â said the Teacher, âthat the TathÄgata has caused the rain to fall. He did the like in bygone days, when he was a fish.â His lesson ended, he identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThe Buddhaâs disciples were the fishes of those days, Änanda was Pajjunna, King of Devas, and I myself the king of the fish.â

âI have no doubt in the village.â
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a lay brother who lived at SÄvatthi. Tradition says that this man, who had entered the Paths and was an earnest believer, was once journeying along on some business or other in the company of a leader of a caravan; in the jungle the carts were unyoked and a coral was constructed; and the good man began to pace up and down at the foot of a certain tree nearby the leader.


Now five hundred robbers, who had watched their time, had surrounded the spot, armed with bows, clubs, and other weapons, with the object of looting the encampment. 
{1.333}
 Still unceasingly that lay brother paced to and fro. âSurely that must be their sentry,â said the robbers when they noticed him, âwe will wait till he is asleep and then loot them.â So, being unable to surprise the camp, they stopped where they were. Still that lay brother kept pacing to and fro â all through the first watch, all through the middle watch, and all through the last watch of the night. When day dawned, the robbers, who had never had their chance, threw down the stones and clubs which they had brought, and bolted.


His business done, that lay brother came back to SÄvatthi, and, approaching the Teacher, asked him this question, âIn guarding themselves, sir, do men prove guardians of others?â


âYes, lay brother. In guarding himself a man guards others; in guarding others, he guards himself.â


âOh, how well-said, sir, is this utterance of the Fortunate One! When I was journeying with a caravan-leader, I resolved to guard myself by pacing to and fro at the foot of a tree, and by so doing I guarded the whole caravan.â


Said the Teacher, âLay brother, in bygone days too the wise and good guarded others while guarding themselves.â And, so saying, at the lay brotherâs request he told this story of the past.

I have no doubt in the village, thereâs no fear for me in the wilds, having mounted the straight path through loving-kindness and compassion.

His lesson ended, the Teacher showed the connection and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThe Buddhaâs followers were the caravan-folk of those days, and I the ascetic.â

In the present king Pasenadi had 16 dreams which leave him fearful.

He then tells how these dreams were dreamt in a past life, and interpreted in a similar way.

 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana about sixteen wonderful dreams. For in the last watch of one night (so tradition says) the king of Kosala, who had been asleep all the night, dreamed sixteen great dreams, 
{1.335}
 and woke up in great fright and alarm as to what they might portend for him. So strong was the fear of death upon him that he could not stir, but lay there huddled up on his bed. Now, when the night grew light, his brahmins and family priests came to him and with due obeisance asked whether his majesty had slept well.


âHow could I sleep well, my teachers?â answered the king. âFor just at daybreak I dreamed sixteen wonderful dreams, and I have been in terror ever since! Tell me, what it all means.â


âWe shall be able to judge, on hearing them.â


Then the king told them his dreams, and asked what those visions would entail upon him.


The brahmins fell wringing their hands! âWhy wring your hands, brahmins?â asked the king. âBecause, sire, these are evil dreams.â âWhat will come of them?â said the king. âOne of three calamities â harm to your kingdom, to your life, or to your riches.â âIs there a remedy, or is there not?â âUndoubtedly these dreams in themselves are so threatening as to be without remedy; but none the less we will find a remedy for them. Otherwise, what boots our much study and learning?â âWhat then do you propose to do to avert the evil?â âWherever four roads meet, we would offer sacrifice, sire.â âMy teachers,â cried the king in his terror, âmy life is in your hands; make haste and work my safety.â âLarge sums of money, and large supplies of food of every kind will be ours,â thought the exultant brahmins; and, bidding the king have no fear, they departed from the palace. Outside the town they dug a sacrificial pit and collected a host of fourfooted creatures, perfect and without blemish, and a multitude of birds. But still they discovered something lacking, and back they kept coming to the king to ask for this that and the other. Now their doings were watched by queen MallikÄ, who came to the king and asked what made these brahmins keep coming to him.


âI envy you,â said the king, âa snake in your ear, and you not to know of it!â âWhat does your majesty mean?â âI have dreamed, oh such unlucky dreams! The brahmins tell me they point to one of three calamities; and they are anxious to offer sacrifices to avert the evil. And this is what brings them here so often.â âBut has your majesty consulted the chief brahmin both of this world and of the world of Devas?â âWho, pray, may he be, my dear?â asked the king. âKnow you not that chief personage of all the world, the all-knowing and pure, the spotless master-brahmin? Surely, he, the Fortunate One, will understand your dreams. Go, ask him.â âAnd so I will, my queen,â said the king. And away he went to the monastery, saluted the Teacher, and sat down. âWhat, pray, brings your majesty here so early in the morning?â asked the Teacher in his sweet tones. âSir,â said the king, âjust before daybreak 
{1.336}
 I dreamed sixteen wonderful dreams, which so terrified me that I told them to the brahmins. They told me that my dreams boded evil, and that to avert the threatened calamity they must offer sacrifice wherever four roads met. And so they are busy with their preparations, and many living creatures have the fear of death before their eyes. But I pray you, who are the chief personage in the world of men and Devas, you into whose ken comes all possible knowledge of things past and present and to be â I pray you tell me what will come of my dreams, O Fortunate One.â
 [1.188]


âTrue it is, sire, that there is none other save me, who can tell what your dreams signify or what will come of them. I will tell you. Only first of all relate to me your dreams as they appeared to you.â


âI will, sir,â said the king, and at once began this list, following the order of the dreamsâ appearance:

âBulls first, and trees, and cows, and calves,

Horse, dish, female jackal, waterpot,

A pond, raw rice, and sandalwood,

And gourds that sank, and stones that swam, 
See 
MahÄvÄ«racarita
, p. 13, 
MahÄbhÄrata
, ii. 2196.


With frogs that gobbled up black snakes,

A crow with colourful retinue,

And wolves in panic-fear of goats!â

1. âHow was it, sir, that I had the following one of my dreams? I thought, four black bulls, like collyrium in hue, came from the four cardinal directions to the royal courtyard with avowed intent to fight; and people flocked together to see the bull-fight, till a great crowd had gathered. But the bulls only made a show of fighting, roared and bellowed, and finally went off without fighting at all. This was my first dream. What will come of it?â


âSire, that dream shall have no issue in your days or in mine. But hereafter, when kings shall be stingy and unrighteous, and when folk shall be unrighteous, in days when the world is perverted, when good is waning and evil waxing apace â in those days of the worldâs discontent there shall fall no rain from the heavens, the feet of the storm shall be lamed, the crops shall wither, and famine shall be on the land. Then shall the clouds gather as if for rain from the four quarters of the heavens; there shall be haste first to carry indoors the rice and crops that the women have spread in the sun to dry, for fear the harvest should get wet; and then with spade and basket in hand the men shall go forth to bank up the dykes. As though in sign of coming rain, the thunder shall bellow, the lightning shall flash from the clouds â but even as the bulls in your dream that fought not, so the clouds shall flee away without raining. This is what shall come of this dream. But no harm shall come therefrom to you; 
{1.337}
 for it was with regard to the future that you dreamed this dream. What the brahmins told you, was said only to get themselves a livelihood.â And when the Teacher had thus told the fulfilment of this dream, he said: âTell me your second dream, sire.â


2. âSir,â said the king, âmy second dream was after this manner: I thought little tiny trees and shrubs burst through the soil, and when they had grown scarce a span or two high, they flowered and bore fruit! This was my second dream; what shall come of it?â


âSire,â said the Teacher, âthis dream shall have its fulfilment in days when the world has fallen into decay and when men are shortlived. In times to come the passions shall be strong; quite young girls shall go to live with men, and it shall be with them after the manner of women, they shall conceive and bear children. The flowers typify their issues, and the fruit their offspring. But you, sire, have nothing to fear therefrom. Tell me your third dream, O great king.â


3. âI thought, sir, I saw cows sucking the milk of calves which they had borne that self-same day. This was my third dream. What shall come of it?â


âThis dream too shall have its fulfilment only in days to come, when respect shall cease to be paid to age. For in the future men, showing no reverence for parents or parents-in-law, shall themselves administer the family estate, and, if such be their good pleasure, shall bestow food and clothing on the old folks, but shall withhold their gifts, if it be not their pleasure to give. Then shall the old folks, destitute and dependent, exist by favour of their own children, like big cows suckled by calves a day old. But you have nothing to fear therefrom. Tell me your fourth dream.â
 [1.189]


4. âI thought, sir, I saw men unyoking a team of draught-oxen, sturdy and strong, and setting young steers to draw the load; and the steers, proving unequal to the task laid on them, refused and stood stock-still, so that wagons moved not on their way. This was my fourth dream. What shall come of it?â


âHere again the dream shall not have its fulfilment until the future, in the days of unrighteous kings. For in days to come, unrighteous and stingy kings shall show no honour to wise lords skilled in precedent, fertile in expedient, and able to get through business; nor shall appoint to the courts of law and justice aged councillors of wisdom and of learning in the Dhamma. Nay, they shall honour the very young and foolish, and appoint such to preside in the courts. And these latter, ignorant alike of state-craft and of practical knowledge, shall not be able to bear the burden of their honours or to govern, but because of their incompetence shall throw off the yoke of office. Whereon the aged and wise lords, albeit right able to cope with all difficulties, shall keep in mind how they were passed over, and shall decline to aid, saying: âIt is no business of ours; we are outsiders; let the boys of the inner circle see to it.â 
{1.338}
 Hence they shall stand aloof, and ruin shall assail those kings on every hand. It shall be even as when the yoke was laid on the young steers, who were not strong enough for the burden, and not upon the team of sturdy and strong draught-oxen, who alone were able to do the work. Howbeit, you have nothing to fear therefrom. Tell me your fifth dream.â


5. âI thought, sir, I saw a horse with a mouth on either side, to which fodder was given on both sides, and it ate with both its mouths. This was my fifth dream. What shall come of it?â


âThis dream too shall have its fulfilment only in the future, in the days of unrighteous and foolish kings, who shall appoint unrighteous and covetous men to be judges. These base ones, fools, despising the good, shall take bribes from both sides as they sit in the seat of judgment, and shall be filled with this two-fold corruption, even as the horse that ate fodder with two mouths at once. Howbeit, you have nothing to fear therefrom. Tell me your sixth dream.â


6. âI thought, sir, I saw people holding out a well-scoured golden bowl worth a hundred thousand pieces, and begging an old jackal to stale therein. And I saw the beast do so. This was my sixth dream. What shall come of it?â


âThis dream too shall only have its fulfilment in the future. For in the days to come, unrighteous kings, though sprung of a race of kings, mistrusting the scions of their old nobility, shall not honour them, but exalt in their stead the low-born; whereby the nobles shall be brought low and the low-born raised to lordship. Then shall the great families be brought by very need to seek to live by dependence on the upstarts, and shall offer them their daughters in marriage. And the union of the noble maidens with the low-born shall be like unto the urinating of the old jackal in the golden bowl. Howbeit, you have nothing to fear therefrom. Tell me your seventh dream.â


7. âA man was weaving rope, sir, and as he wove, he threw it down at his feet. Under his bench lay a hungry female jackal, which kept eating the rope as he wove, but without the man knowing it. This is what I saw. This was my seventh dream. What shall come of it?â 
cf. the story of Ocnus in 
Pausanias
 x. 29.


âThis dream too shall not have its fulfilment till the future. For in days to come, women shall lust after men and strong drink and finery and gadding abroad and after the joys of this world. In their wickedness and profligacy these women shall drink strong drink with their lovers; they shall flaunt in garlands and perfumes and unguents; and heedless of even the most pressing of their household duties, they shall keep watching for their lovers, even at crevices high up in the outer wall; aye, they shall pound up the very seed-corn that should be sown on the morrow so as to provide good cheer; in all these ways shall they plunder the store won by the hard work of their husbands in field and byre, devouring the poor menâs substance even as the hungry jackal under the bench ate up the rope of the rope-maker as he wove it. 
{1.339}
 Howbeit, you have nothing to fear therefrom. Tell me your eighth dream.â
 [1.190]


8. âI thought, sir, I saw at a palace gate a big pitcher which was full to the brim and stood amid a number of empty ones. And from the four cardinal points, and from the four intermediate points as well, there kept coming a constant stream of people of all the four castes, carrying water in pots and pouring it into the full pitcher. And the water overflowed and ran away. But none the less they still kept on pouring more and more water into the over-flowing vessel, without a single man giving so much as a glance at the empty pitchers. This was my eighth dream. What shall come of it?â


âThis dream too shall not have its fulfilment until the future. For in days to come the world shall decay; the kingdom shall grow weak, its kings shall grow poor and stingy; the foremost among them shall have no more than 100,000 pieces of money in his treasury. Then shall these kings in their need set the whole of the country-folk to work for them; for the kingsâ sake shall the toiling folk, leaving their own work, sow grain and pulse, and keep watch and reap and thresh and garner; for the kingsâ sake shall they plant sugar-canes, make and drive sugar-mills, and boil down the molasses; for the kingsâ sake shall they lay out flower-gardens and orchards, and gather in the fruits. And as they gather in all the divers kinds of produce they shall fill the royal garners to overflowing, not giving so much as a glance at their own empty barns at home. Thus it shall be like filling up the full pitcher, heedless of the quite-empty ones. Howbeit, you have nothing to fear therefrom. Tell me your ninth dream.â


9. âI thought, sir, I saw a deep pool with shelving banks all round and over-grown with the five kinds of lotuses. From every side two-footed creatures and four-footed creatures flocked there to drink of its waters. The depths in the middle were muddy, but the water was clear and sparkling at the margin where the various creatures went down into the pool. This was my ninth dream. What shall come of it?â


âThis dream too shall not have its fulfilment till the future. For in days to come kings shall grow unrighteous; they shall rule after their own will and pleasure, and shall not execute judgment according to righteousness. These kings shall hunger after riches and wax fat on bribes; they shall not show mercy, love and compassion toward their people, but be fierce and cruel, amassing wealth by crushing their subjects like sugar-canes in a mill and by taxing them even to the uttermost farthing. Unable to pay the oppressive tax, the people shall fly from village and town and the like, and take refuge upon the borders of the realm; the heart of the land shall be a wilderness, while the borders shall teem with people â even as the water was muddy in the middle of the pool and clear at the margin. Howbeit, you have nothing to fear therefrom. 
{1.340}
 Tell me your tenth dream.â


10. âI thought, sir, I saw rice boiling in a pot without getting done. By not getting done, I mean that it looked as though it were sharply marked off and kept apart, so that the cooking went on in three distinct stages. For part was sodden, part hard and raw, and part just cooked to a nicety. This was my tenth dream. What shall come of it?â


âThis dream too shall not have its fulfilment till the future. For in days to come kings shall grow unrighteous; the people surrounding the kings shall grow unrighteous too, as also shall brahmins and householders, townsmen, and countryfolk; yes, all people alike shall grow unrighteous, not excepting even sages and brahmins. Next, their very tutelary deities â the spirits to whom they offer sacrifice, the spirits of the trees, and the spirits of the air â shall become unrighteous also. The very winds that blow over the realms of these unrighteous kings shall grow cruel and lawless; they shall shake the mansions of the skies and thereby kindle the anger of the spirits that dwell there, so that they will not suffer rain to fall â or, if it does rain, it shall not fall on all the kingdom at once, nor shall the kindly shower fall on all tilled or sown lands alike to help them in their need. And, as in the kingdom at large, so in each several district and village and over each separate pool or lake, the rain shall not fall at one and the same time on its whole expanse; if it rain on the upper part, it shall not rain upon the lower; here the crops shall be spoiled by a heavy downpour, 
[1.191]
 there wither for very drought, and here again thrive apace with kindly showers to water them. So the crops sown within the confines of a single kingdom â like the rice in the one pot â shall have no uniform character. Howbeit, you have nothing to fear therefrom. Tell me your eleventh dream.â


11. âI thought, sir, I saw sour buttermilk bartered for precious sandalwood, worth 100,000 pieces of money. This was my eleventh dream. What shall come of it?â


âThis dream too shall not have its fulfilment till the future â in the days when my dispensation is waning. For in days to come many greedy and shameless monks shall arise, who for their bellyâs sake shall preach the very words in which I inveighed against greed! Because they have deserted by reason of their belly and have taken their stand on the side of the sectaries, 
Reading 
titthakarÄnaá¹ pakkhe
, as conjectured by FausbÃ¶ll.
 they shall fail to make their preaching lead up to NibbÄna. Nay, their only thought, as they preach, shall be by fine words and sweet voices to induce men to give them costly raiment and the like, and to be minded to give such gifts. Others again seated in the highways, at the street-corners, at the doors of kingsâ palaces, and so forth, shall stoop to preach for money, yes for mere coined kahÄpanas, half-kahÄpanas, pÄdas, or mÄsakas! 
See 
Vinaya
 ii. 294 for the same list; and see page 6 of Rhys Davidsâ âAncient Coins and Measures of Ceylonâ in 
Numismata Orientalia
 (TrÃ¼bner).
 And as they thus barter away for food or raiment or for kahÄpanas and half-kahÄpanas my Dhamma the worth whereof is NibbÄna, they shall be even as those who bartered away for sour buttermilk precious sandalwood worth 100,000 pieces. 
{1.341}
 Howbeit, you have nothing to fear therefrom. Tell me your twelfth dream.â


12. âI thought, sir, I saw empty pumpkins sinking in the water. What shall come of it?â


âThis dream also shall not have its fulfilment till the future, in the days of unrighteous kings, when the world is perverted. For in those days shall kings show favour not to the scions of the nobility, but to the low-born only; and these latter shall become great lords, while the nobles sink into poverty. Alike in the royal presence, in the palace gates, in the council chamber, and in the courts of justice, the words of the low-born alone (whom the empty pumpkins typify) shall be established, as though they had sunk down till they rested on the bottom. So too in the assemblies of the Saá¹gha, in the greater and lesser conclaves, and in enquiries regarding bowls, robes, lodging, and the like â the counsel only of the wicked and the vile shall be considered to have saving power, not that of the modest monks. Thus everywhere it shall be as when the empty pumpkins sank. Howbeit, you have nothing to fear therefrom. Tell me your thirteenth dream.â


13. Hereupon the king said: âI thought, sir, I saw huge blocks of solid rock, as big as houses, floating like ships upon the waters. What shall come of it?â


âThis dream also shall not have its fulfilment before such times as those of which I have spoken. For in those days unrighteous kings shall show honour to the low-born, who shall become great lords, while the nobles sink into poverty. Not to the nobles, but to the upstarts alone shall respect be paid. In the royal presence, in the council chamber, or in the courts of justice, the words of the nobles learned in the Dhamma (and it is they whom the solid rocks typify) shall drift idly by, and not sink deep into the hearts of men; when they speak, the upstarts shall merely laugh them to scorn, saying, âWhat is this these fellows are saying?â So too in the assemblies of the monks, as aforesaid, men shall not deem worthy of respect the excellent among the monks; the words of such shall not sink deep, but drift idly by â even as when the rocks floated upon the waters. Howbeit, you have nothing to fear therefrom. Tell me your fourteenth dream.â


14. âI thought, sir, I saw tiny frogs, no bigger than minute flowerets, swiftly pursuing huge black snakes, chopping them up like so many lotus-stalks and gobbling them up. What shall come of this?â
 [1.192]


âThis dream too shall not have its fulfilment till those days to come such as those of which I have spoken, when the world is decaying. For then shall menâs passions be so strong, and their sensual desires so hot, that they shall be the thralls of the very youngest of their wives for the time being, at whose sole disposal shall be slaves and hired servants, oxen, buffaloes and all cattle, gold and silver, and everything that is in the house. Should the poor husband ask where the money (say) or a robe is, at once he shall be told that it is where it is, that he should mind his own business, and not be so inquisitive as to what is, or is not, in her house. And therewithal in divers ways the wives with abuse and goading taunts shall establish their dominion over their husbands, as over slaves and bond-servants. 
{1.342}
 Thus shall it be like as when the tiny frogs, no bigger than minute flowerets, gobbled up the big black snakes. Howbeit, you have nothing to fear therefrom. Tell me your fifteenth dream.â


15. âI thought, sir, I saw a village crow, in which dwelt the whole of the Ten Vices, escorted by a retinue of those birds which, because of their golden sheen, are called Royal Golden Mallards. What shall come of it?â


âThis dream too shall not have its fulfilment till the future, till the reign of weakling kings. In days to come kings shall arise who shall know nothing about elephants or other arts, and shall be cowards in the field. Fearing to be deposed and cast from their royal estate, they shall raise to power not their peers but their footmen, bath-attendants, barbers, and such like. Thus, shut out from royal favour and unable to support themselves, the nobles shall be reduced to dancing attendance on the upstarts â as when the crow had Royal Golden Mallards for a retinue. Howbeit, you have nothing to fear therefrom. Tell me your sixteenth dream.â


16. âHeretofore, sir, it always used to be panthers that preyed on goats; but I thought I saw goats chasing panthers and devouring them â munch, munch, munch! â while at bare sight of the goats afar off, terror-stricken wolves fled quaking with fear and hid themselves in their fastnesses in the thicket. Such was my dream. What shall come of it?â


âThis dream too shall not have its fulfilment till the future, till the reign of unrighteous kings. In those days the low-born shall be raised to lordship and be made royal favourites, while the nobles shall sink into obscurity and distress. Gaining influence in the courts of law because of their favour with the king, these upstarts shall claim perforce the ancestral estates, the raiment, and all the property of the old nobility. And when these latter plead their rights before the courts, then shall the kingâs minions have them cudgelled and bastinadoed and taken by the throat and cast out with words of scorn, such as: âKnow your place, fools! What? Do you dispute with us? The king shall know of your insolence, and we will have your hands and feet chopped off and other correctives applied!â Hereupon the terrified nobles shall affirm that their own belongings really belong to the overbearing upstarts, and will tell the favourites to accept them. And they shall get them home and there cower in an agony of fear. Likewise, evil monks shall harry at pleasure good and worthy monks, till these latter, finding none to help them, shall flee to the jungle. And this oppression of the nobles and of the good monks by the low-born and by the evil monks, shall be like the scaring of wolves by goats. Howbeit, you have nothing to fear therefrom. For this dream too has reference to future times only. 
{1.343}
 It was not truth, it was not love for you, that prompted the brahmins to prophesy as they did. No, it was greed of gain, and the insight that is bred of covetousness, that shaped all their self-seeking utterances.â


Thus did the Teacher expound the import of these sixteen great dreams, adding, âYou, sire, are not the first to have these dreams; they were dreamed by kings of bygone days also; and, then as now, the brahmins found in them a pretext for sacrifices; whereupon, at the instance of the wise and good, the Bodhisatta was consulted, and the dreams were expounded by them of old time 
[1.193]
 in just the same manner as they have now been expounded.â And so saying, at the kingâs request, he told this story of the past.

Bulls, trees, cows, oxen and a horse, a golden bowl, jackal and pot, a lake, uncooked rice, sandalwood, pumpkins sinking, and stones floating. Frogs swallowing black cobra snakes, crows, surrounded by Supaá¹á¹as,  these wolves that are afraid of goats.

His lesson ended, the Teacher said: âYou have nothing to fear from these dreams; away with the sacrifice!â Having had the sacrifice removed, and having saved the lives of a multitude of creatures, he showed the connection and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âÄnanda was the king of those days, SÄriputta the young brahmin, and I the ascetic.â


(PÄli note. But after the passing of the Fortunate One, the editors of the Great Redaction put the three first lines into the Commentary, and making the lines from âAnd gourds that sankâ into one verse (therewith), 
[The Commentator appears to be trying to explain why the one verse is 7 lines long, which is unusual indeed.]
 put the whole story into the First Book.)

## Full Story
âBoth are lame.â
 
[1.195]
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a miserly Lord High Treasurer. Hard by the city of RÄjagaha, as we are told, was a town named Jagghery, and here dwelt a certain Lord High Treasurer, known as the Millionaire Miser, who was worth eighty crores! Not so much as the tiniest drop of oil that a blade of grass will take up, did he either give away or consume for his own enjoyment. So he made no use of all his wealth either for his family or for sages and brahmins: it remained unenjoyed â like a pool haunted by Rakkhasas. Now, it fell out on a day that the Teacher arose at dawn moved with a great compassion, and as he reviewed those ripe for conversion throughout the universe, he became aware that this Treasurer with his wife some four hundred miles away were destined to tread the paths of emancipation.


Now the day before, the Lord High Treasurer had gone his way to the palace to wait upon the king, and was on his homeward way when he saw a country-bumpkin, who was quite empty within, eating a cake stuffed with gruel. The sight awoke a craving within him! But, after arriving at his own house, 
{1.346}
 be thought to himself, âIf I say I should like a stuffed cake, a whole host of people will want to share my meal; and that means getting through ever so much of my rice and ghee and sugar. I mustnât say a word to a soul.â So he walked about, wrestling with his craving. As hour after hour passed, he grew yellower and yellower, and the veins stood out like cords on his emaciated frame. Unable at last to bear it any longer, he went to his own room and lay down hugging his bed. But still not a word would he say to a soul for fear of wasting his substance! Well, his wife came to him, and, stroking his back, said: âWhat is the matter, my husband?â


âNothing,â said he. âPerhaps the king has been cross to you?â âNo, he has not.â âHave your children or servants done anything to annoy you?â âNothing of that kind, either.â âWell, then, have you a craving for anything?â But still not a word would he say â all because of his preposterous fear that he might waste his substance; but lay there speechless on his bed. âSpeak, husband,â said the wife, âtell me what you have a craving for.â âYes,â said he with a gulp, âI have got a craving for one thing.â âAnd what is that, my husband?â âI should like a stuffed cake to eat!â âNow why not have said so at once? Youâre rich enough! Iâll cook cakes enough to feast the whole town of Jagghery.â âWhy trouble about them? They must work to earn their own meal.â âWell then, Iâll cook only enough for our street.â âHow rich you are!â âThen, Iâll cook just enough for our own household.â âHow extravagant you are!â âVery good, Iâll cook only enough for our children.â âWhy bother about them?â âVery good then, Iâll only provide for our two selves.â âWhy should you be in it?â âThen, Iâll cook just enough for you alone,â said the wife.


âSoftly,â said the Lord High Treasurer, âthere are a lot of people on the watch for signs of cooking in this place. Pick out broken rice â being careful to leave the whole grain â and take a brazier and cooking-pots and just a very little milk and ghee and honey and molasses; then up with you to the seventh story of the house and do the cooking up there. There I will sit alone and undisturbed to eat.â


Obedient to his wishes, the wife had all the necessary things carried up, climbed all the way up herself, sent the servants away, and dispatched word to the Treasurer to come. Up he climbed, shutting and bolting door after door as he ascended, till at last he came to the seventh floor, the door of which he also shut fast. Then he sat down. His wife lit the fire in the brazier, put her pot on, and set about cooking the cakes.
 [1.196]


Now in the early morning, the Teacher had said to the elder Great MoggallÄna, âMoggallÄna, this Miser Millionaire 
{1.347}
 in the town of Jagghery near RÄjagaha, wanting to eat cakes himself, is so afraid of letting others know, that he is having them cooked for him right up on the seventh story. Go there; convert the man to self-denial, and by transcendental power transport husband and wife, cakes, milk, ghee and all, here to Jetavana. This day I and the five hundred monks will stay at home, and I will make the cakes furnish them with a meal.â


Obedient to the Teacherâs bidding, the elder by his Supernormal Powers passed to the town of Jagghery, and rested in mid-air before the chamber-window, duly clad in his under and outer cloths, bright as a jewelled image. The unexpected sight of the elder made the Lord High Treasurer quake with fear. Thought he to himself, âIt was to escape such visitors that I climbed up here: and now thereâs one of them at the window!â And, failing to realise the comprehension of that which he must needs comprehend, he sputtered with rage, like sugar and salt thrown on the fire, as he burst out with, âWhat will you get, sage, by your simply standing in mid-air? Why, you may pace up and down till youâve made a path in the pathless air â and yet youâll still get nothing.â


The elder began to pace to and fro in his place in the air! âWhat will you get by pacing to and fro?â said the Treasurer! âYou may sit cross-legged in meditation in the air â but still youâll get nothing.â The elder sat down with legs crossed! Then said the Treasurer, âWhat will you get by sitting there? You may come and stand on the window-sill; but even that wonât get you anything!â The elder took his stand on the window-sill. âWhat will you get by standing on the window-sill? Why, you may belch smoke, and yet youâll still get nothing!â said the Treasurer. Then the elder belched forth smoke till the whole palace was filled with it. The Treasurerâs eyes began to smart as though pricked with needles; and, for fear at last that his house might be set on fire, he checked himself from adding, âYou wonât get anything even if you burst into flames.â Thought he to himself, âThis elder is most persistent! He simply wonât go away empty-handed! I must have just one cake given him.â So he said to his wife, âMy dear, cook one little cake and give it to the sage to get rid of him.â


So she mixed quite a little dough in a crock. But the dough swelled and swelled till it filled the whole crock, and grew to be a great big cake! âWhat a lot you must have used!â exclaimed the Treasurer at the sight. And he himself with the tip of a spoon took a very little of the dough, and put that in the oven to bake. But that tiny piece of dough grew larger than the first lump; and, one after another, every piece of dough he took became ever so big! Then he lost heart and said to his wife, âYou give him a cake, dear.â But, as soon as she took one cake from the basket, at once all the other cakes stuck fast to it. So she cried out to her husband that all the cakes had stuck together, and that she could not part them.


âOh, Iâll soon part them,â said he â but found he could not!


Then husband and wife both took hold of the mass of cakes at the corner and tried to get them apart. But tug as they might, they could make no more impression together on the mass than they did singly. Now as the Treasurer was pulling away at the cakes, he burst into a perspiration, and his craving left him. Then said he to his wife, âI donât want the cakes; 
{1.348}
 give them, basket and all, to this ascetic.â And she approached the elder with the basket in her hand. Then the elder preached the Dhamma to the pair, and proclaimed the excellence of the Three Jewels. And, teaching that giving was true sacrifice, he made the fruits of generosity and other good works to shine forth even as the full-moon in the heavens. Won by the elderâs words, the Treasurer said: âSir, come here and sit on this couch to eat your cakes.â


âLord High Treasurer,â said the elder, âthe Supreme Buddha with five hundred monks sits in the monastery waiting for a meal of cakes. If such be your good pleasure, I would ask you to bring your wife and the cakes with you, and let us be going to the Teacher.â âBut where, sir, is the Teacher at the present 
[1.197]
 time?â âFive and forty leagues away, in the monastery at Jetavana.â âHow are we to get all that way, sir, without losing a long time on the road?â âIf it be your pleasure, Lord High Treasurer, I will transport you there by my Supernormal Powers. The head of the staircase in your house shall remain where it is, but the bottom shall be at the main-gate of Jetavana. In this wise will I transport you to the Teacher in the time which it takes to go downstairs.â âSo be it, sir,â said the Treasurer.


Then the elder, keeping the top of the staircase where it was, commanded, saying: âLet the foot of the staircase be at the main-gate of Jetavana.â And so it came to pass! In this way did the elder transport the Treasurer and his wife to Jetavana quicker than they could get down the stairs.


Then husband and wife came before the Teacher and said meal-time had come. And the Teacher, passing into the Refectory, sat down on the Buddha-seat prepared for him, with the Saá¹gha gathered round. Then the Lord High Treasurer poured the Water of Donation over the hands of the Saá¹gha with the Buddha at its head, while his wife placed a cake in the alms-bowl of the TathÄgata. Of this he took what sufficed to support life, as also did the five hundred monks. Next the Treasurer went round offering milk mixed with ghee and honey and jagghery; and the Teacher and the Saá¹gha brought their meal to a close. Lastly the Treasurer and his wife ate their fill, but still there seemed no end to the cakes. Even when all the monks and the scrap-eaters throughout the monastery had all had a share, still there was no sign of the end approaching. So they told the Teacher, saying: âSir, the supply of cakes grows no smaller.â


âThen throw them down by the great gate of the monastery.â


So they threw them away in a cave not far from the gateway; and to this day a spot called âThe Pancake,â is shown at the extremity of that cave.


The Lord High Treasurer and his wife approached and stood before the Fortunate One, who returned thanks; and at the close of his words of thanks, the pair attained Fruition of the First Path. Then, taking their leave of the Teacher, the two mounted the stairs at the great gate and found themselves in their own home once more. 
{1.349}
 Afterwards, the Lord High Treasurer lavished eighty crores of money solely on the dispensation the Buddha taught.


Next day the Perfect Buddha, returning to Jetavana after a round for alms in SÄvatthi, delivered a Sugataâs discourse to the monks before retiring to the seclusion of the Perfumed Chamber. At evening, the monks gathered together in the Dhamma Hall, and exclaimed, âHow great is the power of the elder MoggallÄna! In a moment he converted a miser to generosity, brought him with the cakes to Jetavana, set him before the Teacher, and established him in safety. How great is the power of the elder!â As they sat talking thus of the goodness of the elder, the Teacher entered, and, on enquiry, was told of the subject of their talk. âMonks,â said he, âa monk who is the converter of a household, should approach that household without causing it annoyance or vexation â even as the bee when it sucks the nectar from the flower; in such wise should he draw nigh to declare the excellence of the Buddha.â And in praise of the elder MoggallÄna, he recited this verse [Dhp 49]:

Like bees, that harm no flowerâs scent or hue

But, laden with its honey, fly away,

So, sage, within your village walk your way.

Then, to set forth still more the elderâs goodness, he said: âThis is not the first time, monks, that the miserly Treasurer has been converted by MoggallÄna. In other days too the elder converted him, and taught him how deeds and their effects are linked together.â So saying, he told this story of the past.
 [1.198]

Both are lame, both are handicapped, both of them have eyes that are crossed, warts have arisen on both, I do not see which is Illisa.

âMonks,â said the Teacher, âthis is not the first time that MoggallÄna has converted the miserly Treasurer; in bygone days too the same man was converted by him.â His lesson ended, he showed the connection and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThis miserly Treasurer was the IllÄ«sa of those days, MoggallÄna was Sakka, King of Devas, Änanda was the king, and I myself the barber.â

[1.202]
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a certain Minister. He, âtis said, ingratiated himself with the king, and, after collecting the royal revenue in a border-village, privily arranged with a band of robbers that he would march his men off into the jungle, leaving the village for the rascals to plunder â on condition that they gave him half the booty. Accordingly, at daybreak when the place was left unprotected, down came the robbers, who slew and ate the cattle, looted the village, and were off with their booty before he came back at evening with his followers. But it was a very short time before his cheating leaked out and came to the ears of the king. And the king sent for him, and, as his guilt was manifest, he was degraded and another headman put in his place. Then the king went to the Teacher at Jetavana and told him what had happened. âSire,â said the Fortunate One, âthe man has only shown the same disposition now which he showed in bygone days.â Then at the kingâs request he told this story of the past.

When cattle are plundered, murdered, houses burned, and people led off, then the son returned a dead son, playing a drum with a harsh sound.

His lesson ended, the Teacher showed the connection and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThe headman of today was also the headman of those days, and I myself the wise and good man who recited the verse.â

## Full Story
âWhatever you boasted of beforehand.â
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a certain braggart among the monks. Tradition says that he used to gather round him monks of all ages, and go about deluding everyone with lying boasts about his noble descent. âAh, monks,â he would say, âthereâs no family so noble as mine, no lineage so peerless. I am a scion of the highest of princely lines; no man is my equal in birth or ancestral estate; there is absolutely no end to the gold and silver and other treasures we possess. Our very slaves and menials are fed on rice and meat-stews, and are clad in the best Benares cloth, with the choicest Benares perfumes to perfume themselves withal; while I, because I have joined the Saá¹gha, 
{1.356}
 have to content myself with this vile fare and this vile garb.â But another monk, after enquiring into his family estate, exposed to the monks the emptiness of this pretension.


So the monks met in the Dhamma Hall, and talk began as to how that monk, in spite of his vows to leave worldly things and cleave only to the dispensation which leads to safety, was going about deluding the monks with his lying boasts. While the fellowâs sinfulness was being discussed, the Teacher entered and enquired what their topic was. And they told him. âThis is not the first time, monks,â said the Teacher, âthat he has gone about boasting; in bygone days too he went about boasting and deluding people.â And so saying, he told this story of the past.

Whatever you boasted of beforehand, yet later you let loose a stinking mess, both are disagreeable, BhÄ«masena: talk of war and now this â you are fatigued.

âThus, monks,â said the Teacher, âthis is not the first time that this monk has been a braggart; he was just the same in bygone days too.â His lesson ended, the Teacher showed the connection and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThis braggart monk was the BhÄ«masena of those days, and I myself the wise Culladhanuggaha.â

## Full Story
âWe have drunk, we have danced.â
 
{1.360}
 This story was told by the Teacher about the elder SÄgata, while he was dwelling in the Ghosita-park near KosambÄ«.


For, after spending the rainy season at SÄvatthi, the Teacher had come on an alms pilgrimage to a market-town named BhaddavatikÄ, where cowherds and goatherds and farmers and wayfarers respectfully besought him not to go down to the Mango Ferry, âFor,â they said, âin the Mango Ferry, in the locality of the naked ascetics, dwells a poisonous and deadly NÄga, known as the NÄga of the Mango Ferry, who might harm the Fortunate One.â Feigning not to hear them, though they repeated their warning thrice, the Fortunate One kept on his way.


While the Fortunate One was dwelling near BhaddavatikÄ in a certain grove there, the elder SÄgata, a servant of the Buddha, who had won such Supernormal Powers as a worldling can possess, went to the locality, piled a couch of leaves at the spot where the NÄga king dwelt, and sat himself down cross-legged thereon. Being unable to conceal his evil nature, the NÄga raised a great smoke. So did the elder. Then the NÄga sent forth flames. So too did the elder. But, while the NÄgaâs flames did no harm to the elder, the elderâs flames did do harm to the NÄga, and so in a short time he mastered the NÄga king and established him in the Refuges and the Precepts, after which he repaired back to the Teacher. And the Teacher, after dwelling as long as it pleased him at BhaddavatikÄ, went on to KosambÄ«.


Now the story of the NÄgaâs conversion by SÄgata, had got noised abroad all over the countryside, and the townsfolk of KosambÄ« went forth to meet the Fortunate One and saluted him, after which they passed to the elder SÄgata and saluting him, said: âTell us, sir, what you lack and we will furnish it.â The elder himself remained 
[1.207]
 silent; but the followers of the Group of Six 
[The âSixâ were notorious monks who are always mentioned as defying the rules of the Saá¹gha.]
 made answer as follows, âSirs, to those who have renounced the world, white spirits are as rare as they are acceptable. Do you think you could get the elder some clear white spirit?â âTo be sure we can,â said the townsfolk, and invited the Teacher to take his meal with them next day. Then they went back to their own town and arranged that each in his own house should offer clear white spirit to the elder, and accordingly they all laid in a store and invited the elder in and plied him with the liquor, house by house. So deep were his potations that, on his way out of town, the elder fell prostrate in the gateway and there lay hiccoughing nonsense.


On his way back from his meal in the town, the Teacher came on the elder lying in this state, and bidding the monks carry SÄgata home, 
{1.361}
 passed on his way to the park. The monks laid the elder down with his head at the TathÄgataâs feet, but he turned round so that he came to lie with his feet towards the TathÄgata. Then the Teacher asked his question, âMonks, does SÄgata show that respect towards me now that he formerly did?â âNo, sir.â âTell me, monks, who it was that mastered the NÄga king of the Mango Ferry?â âIt was SÄgata, sir.â âThink you that in his present state SÄgata could master even a harmless water-snake?â âThat he could not, sir.â âWell now, monks, is it proper to drink that which, when drunk, steals away a manâs senses?â âIt is improper, sir.â Now, after discoursing with the monks in dispraise of the elder, the Fortunate One laid it down as a precept that the drinking of intoxicants was an offence requiring confession and absolution; after which he rose up and passed into his perfumed chamber.


Assembling together in the Dhamma Hall, the monks discussed the defilement of spirit-drinking, saying: âWhat a great defilement is the drinking of spirits, sirs, seeing that it has blinded to the Buddhaâs excellence even one known as wise and having Supernormal Powers.â Entering the Dhamma Hall at this point, the Teacher asked what topic they were discussing; and they told him. âMonks,â said he, âthis is not the first time that they who had renounced the world have lost their senses through drinking spirits; the very same thing took place in bygone days.â And so saying, he told this story of the past.

We have drunk, we have danced, we have sung, we have cried, having drunk ourselves unconscious, we were not found to be monkeys.

His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka â (and henceforth we shall omit the words âshowed the connectionâ) â by saying: âMy disciples were the band of ascetics of those days, and I their teacher.â

âHe is certainly a friend with seven steps.â
 
 {1.364}
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a friend of AnÄthapiá¹á¸ikaâs. Tradition says that the two had made mud-pies together, and had gone to the same school; but, as years went by, the friend, whose name was Wretch [KÄá¸·akaá¹á¹Ä«], sank into great distress and could not make a living anyhow. So he came to the rich man, who was kind to him, and paid him to look after all his property; and the poor friend was employed under AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika and did all his business for him. After he had gone up to the rich manâs it was a common thing to hear in the house, âStand up, Wretch,â or, âSit down, Wretch,â or, âHave your dinner, Wretch.â
 [1.210]


One day the Treasurerâs friends and acquaintances called on him and said: âLord Treasurer, donât let this sort of thing go on in your house. Itâs enough to scare a Yakkha to hear such ill-omened observations as â âStand up, Wretch,â or âSit down, Wretch,â or âHave your dinner, Wretch.â The man is not your social equal; heâs a miserable wretch, dogged by misfortune. Why have anything to do with him?â âNot so,â replied AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika, âa name only serves to denote a man, and the wise do not measure a man by his name; nor is it proper to wax superstitious about mere sounds. Never will I throw over, for his mere nameâs sake, the friend with whom I made mud-pies as a child.â And he rejected their advice.


One day the great man departed to visit a village of which he was headman, leaving the other in charge of the house. Hearing of his departure certain robbers made up their mind to break into the house; and, arming themselves to the teeth, they surrounded it in the night-time. But Wretch had a suspicion that burglars might be expected, and was sitting up for them. And when he knew that they had come, he ran about as if to rouse his people, bidding one sound the conch, another beat the drum, till he had the whole house full of noise, as though he were rousing a whole army of servants. Said the robbers, âThe house is not so empty as we were told; the master must be at home.â Flinging away their stones, clubs and other weapons, away they bolted for their lives.


Next day great alarm was caused by the sight of all the discarded weapons lying round the house; and Wretch was lauded to the skies by such praises as this, âIf the house had not been patrolled by one so wise as this man, the robbers would have simply walked in at their own pleasure and have plundered the house. The Treasurer owes this stroke of good luck to his staunch friend.â And the moment the merchant came back from his village they hastened to tell him the whole story. âAh,â said he, âthis is the trusty guardian of my house whom you wanted me to get rid of. If I had taken your advice and got rid of him; I should be a beggar today. Itâs not the name but the heart within that makes the man.â So saying he raised his wages. And thinking that here was a good story 
{1.365}
 to tell, off he went to the Teacher and gave him a complete account of it all, right through. âThis is not the first time, sir,â said the Teacher, âthat a friend named Wretch has saved his friendâs wealth from robbers; the like happened in bygone days as well.â Then, at AnÄthapiá¹á¸ikaâs request, he told this story of the past.

He is certainly a friend with seven steps, but with twelve he is a companion true, with a month or a fortnight he is like kin, more than that he is just the same as my self, how would I, the cause of my own happiness, abandon my long time friend KÄá¸·akaá¹á¹i?

His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka by saying: âÄnanda was the Wretch of those days, and I myself the Treasurer of Benares.â

âDesire good health, which is the greatest gain.â
 
[1.211]
 
{1.366}
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a boy who was sage in matters relating to spiritual welfare. When he was only seven years old, the boy, who was the son of a very wealthy Treasurer, manifested great intelligence and anxiety for his spiritual welfare; and one day came to his father to ask what were the Paths leading to spiritual welfare. The father could not answer, but he thought to himself, âThis is a very difficult question; from highest heaven to nethermost hell there is none that can answer it, save only the All-knowing Buddha.â So he took the child with him to Jetavana, with a quantity of perfumes and flowers and unguents. After arriving there, he did reverence to the Teacher, bowed down before him, and seating himself on one side, spoke as follows to the Fortunate One, âSir, this boy of mine, who is intelligent and anxious for his spiritual welfare, has asked me what are the Paths leading to spiritual welfare; and, as I did not know, I came to you. Vouchsafe, O Fortunate One, to resolve this question.â âLay brother,â said the Teacher, âthis self-same question was asked me by this very child in former times, and I answered it for him. He knew the answer in bygone days, but now he has forgotten because of a multitude of rebirths.â Then, at the fatherâs request, he told this story of the past.

Desire good health, which is the greatest gain, virtue, approval by elders, learning, conformity to the Dhamma, striving: these six gateways are the entrance to welfare.

In the present a monk is overcome by lust for a woman. The Buddha advises him, that though indulgence is enjoyed at the time, it leads to destruction in the future. He then tells a story of how in a past life he saved his caravan by warding off the consumption of a poisonous fruit.


The Bodhisatta = the caravan leader (satthavÄha),

the Buddhaâs disciples = the rest of the cast (parisÄ).

## Full Story
âNot knowing the fault in the future.â
 
[1.212]
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a lustful monk. Tradition says there was a scion of a good family who gave his heart to the Buddhaâs dispensation and went forth. But one day as he was going his round for alms in SÄvatthi, he was there stirred to sensual desire by the sight of a beautifully dressed woman. Being brought by his teachers and preceptors before the Teacher, he admitted in answer to the enquiries of the Fortunate One that sensual desire had entered into him. Then said the Teacher, âVerily the five sensual desires of the senses are sweet in the hour of actual enjoyment, monk; but this enjoyment of them (in that it entails the miseries of rebirth in hell and the other evil states) is like the eating of the fruit of the Kimpakka tree. Very fair to view is the Kimpakka, very fragrant and sweet; but when eaten, it racks the inwards and brings death. In other days, through ignorance 
{1.368}
 of its evil nature, a multitude of men, seduced by the beauty, fragrance and sweetness of the fruit, ate thereof so that they died.â So saying, he told this story of the past.

It was when he had told this story, that the Teacher, after Fully Awakening, uttered this verse:

Not knowing the fault in the future, he enjoys sensual pleasures, when they ripen they destroy him, like the Kimpakka when eaten.

Having thus shown that the sensual desires, which are so sweet in the hour of fruition, end by slaying their votaries, the Teacher preached the Four Truths, at the close 
{1.369}
 whereof the lustful monk was converted and won the Fruit of the First Path. Of the rest of the Buddhaâs following some won the First, some the Second, and some the Third Path, while others again became Arahats. His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka by saying: âMy disciples were the people of the caravan in those days, and I their leader.â

## Full Story
âIt seems virtue is excellent.â
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a brahmin who put to the test his reputation for virtue. This brahmin, who was maintained by the king of Kosala, had sought the Three Refuges; he kept the Five Precepts, and was versed in the Three Vedas. âThis is a virtuous man,â thought the king, and showed him great honour. But that brahmin thought to himself, âThe king shows honour to me beyond other brahmins, and has manifested his great regard by making me his spiritual director. But is his favour due to my virtue or only to my birth, lineage, family, country and accomplishments? I must clear this up without delay.â


Accordingly, one day when he was leaving the palace, he took without permission a coin from a treasurerâs counter, and went his way. Such was the treasurerâs veneration for the brahmin that he sat perfectly still and said not a word. Next day the brahmin took two coins; but still the official made no remonstrance. The third day the brahmin took a whole handful of coins. âThis is the third day,â cried the treasurer, âthat you have robbed his majesty,â and he shouted out three times, âI have caught the thief who robs the treasury.â In rushed a crowd of people from every side, crying, âAh, youâve long been posing as a model of virtue.â And dealing him two or three blows, they led him before the king. In great sorrow the king said to him, âWhat led you, brahmin, to do so wicked a thing?â And he gave orders, saying: âOff with him to punishment.â âI am no thief, sire,â said the brahmin. âThen why did you take money from the treasury?â âBecause you showed me such great honour, sire, and because I made up my mind to find out whether that honour was paid to my birth and the like or only to my virtue. That was my motive, and now I know for certain (inasmuch as you order me off to punishment) that it was my virtue and not my birth and other advantages, that won me your majestyâs favour.


Virtue I know to be the chief and supreme good; I know too that to virtue
 [1.214]
 
{1.370}
 I can never attain in this life, while I remain a layman, living in the midst of sensual pleasures. Wherefore, this very day I would willingly go to the Teacher at Jetavana and renounce the world for the Saá¹gha. Grant me your leave, sire.â The king consenting, the brahmin set out for Jetavana. His friends and relations in a body tried to turn him from his purpose, but, finding their efforts of no avail, left him alone.


He came to the Teacher and asked to be admitted to the Saá¹gha. After admission to the lower and higher ordination, he won by application insight and became an Arahat, whereon he drew near to the Teacher, saying: âSir, my joining the Saá¹gha has borne the Supreme Fruit,â thereby signifying that he had became an Arahat.


Hearing of this, the monks, assembling in the Dhamma Hall, spoke with one another of the virtues of the kingâs family priest who tested his own reputation for virtue and who, leaving the king, had now risen to be an Arahat. Entering the Hall, the Teacher asked what the monks were discussing, and they told him. âNot without a precedent, monks,â said he, âis the action of this brahmin in putting to the test his reputation for virtue and in working out his safety after renouncing the world. The like was done by the wise and good of bygone days as well.â And so saying, he told this story of the past.

It seems virtue is excellent, virtue is highest in the world, see the fierce poisonous cobra, virtuous, it was not destroyed.

His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka by saying: âMy disciples were the kingâs following in those days, and I myself the kingâs family priest.â

## Analysis
In the present a brahmin is bound by superstition and believes an old gnawed piece of cloth will bring bad luck, so he seeks to have it thrown away. As the cloth is being taken away for disposal, the Buddha intercepts it and takes it for himself, declaring that superstitions are not efficacious. He then tells a similar story about a past life.


The Bodhisatta = the ascetic (tapasa),

father and son = the same in the past (pitÄputtÄ).

## Full Story
âThe one who uproots the omens.â
 This story was told by the Teacher while at the Bamboo Grove about a brahmin who was skilled in the signs 
{1.372}
 which can be drawn from pieces of cloth. 
cf. DN 13 
Tevijjasutta
 translated by Rhys Davids in âBuddhist Suttas,â p. 197.
 Tradition says that at RÄjagaha dwelt a brahmin who was superstitious and held false views, not believing in the Three Jewels. This brahmin was very rich and wealthy, abounding in substance; and a female mouse gnawed a suit of clothes of his, which was lying by in a chest.


One day after bathing himself all over, he called for this suit, and then was told of the mischief which the mouse had done. âIf these clothes stop in the house,â thought he to himself, âtheyâll bring ill-luck; such an ill-omened thing is sure to bring a curse. It is out of the question to give them to any of my children or servants; for whosoever has them will bring misfortune on all around him. I must have them thrown away in a charnel ground; 
An 
ÄmakasusÄna
 was an open space or grove in which corpses were exposed for wild-beasts to eat, in order that the earth might not be defiled. cf. the Parsee âTowers of Silence.â
 but how? I cannot hand them to servants; for they might covet and keep them, to the ruin of my house. My son must take them.â So he called his son, and telling him the whole matter bade him take his charge on a stick, without touching the clothes with his hand, and fling them away in a charnel ground. Then the son was to bathe himself all over and return.


Now that morning at dawn of day the Teacher looking 
[1.216]
 round to see what persons could be led to the truth, became aware that the father and son were predestined to attain emancipation. So he betook himself in the guise of a hunter on his way to hunt, to the charnel ground, and sat down at the entrance, emitting the six-coloured rays that mark a Buddha. Soon there came to the spot the young brahmin, carefully carrying the clothes as his father had bidden him, on the end of his stick, just as though he had a house-snake to carry.


âWhat are you doing, young brahmin?â asked the Teacher.


âMy good Gotama,â 
In PÄli 
bho Gotama
, â a form of familiar address. Brahmins are always represented as presuming to say 
bho
 to the Buddha.
 was the reply, âthis suit of clothes, having been gnawed by mice, is like ill-luck personified, and as deadly as though steeped in venom; wherefore my father, fearing that a servant might covet and retain the clothes, has sent me with them. I promised that I would throw them away and bathe afterwards; and thatâs the errand that has brought me here.â âThrow the suit away, then,â said the Teacher; and the young brahmin did so. âThey will just suit me,â said the Teacher, as he picked up the fateful clothes before the young manâs very eyes, regardless of the latterâs earnest warnings and repeated entreaties to him not to take them; and he departed in the direction of the Bamboo Grove.


Home in all haste ran the young brahmin, to tell his father how the ascetic Gotama had declared that the clothes would just suit him, and had persisted, in spite of all warnings to the contrary, in taking the suit away with him to the Bamboo Grove. âThose clothes,â thought the brahmin to himself, âare bewitched and accursed. Even the ascetic Gotama cannot wear them without destruction befalling him; and that would bring me into disrepute. I will give the sage abundance of other garments and get him to throw that suit away.â So with a large number of robes he started in company of his son for the Bamboo Grove.


When he came upon the Teacher he stood respectfully on one side and spoke thus, âIs it indeed true, as I hear, that you, my good Gotama, 
{1.373}
 picked up a suit of clothes in the charnel ground?â âQuite true, brahmin.â âMy good Gotama, that suit is accursed; if you make use of them, they will destroy you. If you stand in need of clothes, take these and throw away that suit.â âBrahmin,â replied the Teacher, âby open profession I have renounced the world, and am content with the rags that lie by the roadside or bathing-places, or are thrown away on dustheaps or in charnel grounds. Whereas you have held your superstitions in bygone days, as well as at the present time.â So saying, at the brahminâs request, he told this story of the past.

Having told this story, the Teacher, after Fully Awakening, taught the Dhamma to the brahmin in this verse:

The one who uproots the omens, both auguries and dreams and signs, transcending the fault of omens, overcoming the ties and the yokes, he does not come to birth again.

When the Teacher had thus preached the Dhamma to the brahmin in the form of this verse, he proceeded further to preach the Four Truths, at the close whereof that brahmin, with his son, attained to the First Path. The Teacher identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThe father and son of today were also the father and son of those days, and I myself the ascetic.â

âHe should speak just excellent words.â
 This story was told by the Teacher while at SÄvatthi, about the precept touching on abusive language. The introductory story and the story of the past are the same as in the NandivisÄlajÄtaka above [Ja 28]. But in this case 
{1.375}
 there is the difference that the Bodhisatta was an ox named SÄrambha, and belonged to a brahmin of Taxila in the kingdom 
[1.218]
 of GandhÄra. 
[I include the story here, with suitable changes.]

This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about the bitter words spoken by the group of six. For, in those days the group of six, when they disagreed with respectable monks, used to taunt, revile and jeer them, and load them with the ten kinds of abuse. This the monks reported to the Fortunate One, who sent for the group of six and asked whether this charge was true. On their admitting its truth, he rebuked them, saying: âMonks, hard words gall even animals: in bygone days an animal made a man who had used harsh language to him lose a thousand pieces.â And, so saying, he told this story of the past.

After telling the story of the past, the Teacher, after Fully Awakening, uttered this verse:

He should speak just excellent words, indeed he should not speak bad words, he who has spoken well is good, but speaking badly he suffers.

It seems that your words are gentle, and that they are kindly spoken, he clings onto a mere straw, but does not take a hundred in gold.

When the Teacher had ended his lesson he identified the JÄtaka by saying: âÄnanda was the brahmin of those days, Uppalavaá¹á¹Ä his wife, and I SÄrambha.â

## Full Story
âHe who doesnât acknowledge the good deed.â
 
[1.220]
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika.


On the borders, so the tale goes, there lived a merchant, who was a correspondent and a friend of AnÄthapiá¹á¸ikaâs, but they had never met. There came a time when this merchant loaded five hundred carts with local produce and gave orders to the men in charge to go to the great merchant AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika, and barter the wares in his correspondentâs shop for their value, and bring back the goods received in exchange. So they came to SÄvatthi, and found AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika. First making him a present, they told him their business. âYou are welcome,â said the great man, and ordered them to be lodged there and provided with money for their needs. After kindly enquiries after their masterâs health, he bartered their merchandise and gave them the goods in exchange. Then they went back to their own district, and reported what had happened.


Shortly afterwards, AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika similarly dispatched five hundred carts with merchandise to the very district in which they dwelt; and his people, when they had got there, went, present in hand, to call upon the border merchant. âWhere do you come from?â said he. âFrom SÄvatthi,â replied they, âfrom your correspondent, AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika.â âAnyone can call himself AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika,â said he with a sneer; and taking their present, he bade them begone, giving them neither lodging nor a gift. So they bartered their goods for themselves and brought back the wares in exchange to SÄvatthi, with the story of the reception they had had.


Now it chanced 
{1.378}
 that this border merchant dispatched another caravan of five hundred carts to SÄvatthi; and his people came with a present in their hands to wait upon AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika. But, as soon as AnÄthapiá¹á¸ikaâs people caught sight of them, they said: âOh, weâll see, sir, that they are properly lodged, fed, and supplied with money for their needs.â And they took the strangers outside the city and bade them unyoke their carts at a suitable spot, adding that rice and a gift would come from AnÄthapiá¹á¸ikaâs house. About the middle watch of the night, having collected a band of serving-men and slaves, they looted the whole caravan, carried off every garment the men had got, drove away their oxen, and took the wheels off the carts, leaving the latter but removing the wheels. Without so much as a shirt among the lot of them, the terrified strangers sped away and managed to reach their home on the border. Then AnÄthapiá¹á¸ikaâs people told him the whole story. âThis capital story,â said he, âshall be my gift to the Teacher today,â and away he went and told it to the Teacher.


âThis is not the first time, sir,â said the Teacher, âthat this border merchant has shown this disposition; he was just the same in days gone by.â Then, at AnÄthapiá¹á¸ikaâs request, he told the following story of the past.

He who doesnât acknowledge the good deed, merit, done in the past, finds when a need arises in the future no one comes to help.

His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThe border merchant of today was the border merchant of those days also; and I was the merchant of Benares.â

And their thoughtless use of the Four Requisites as a rule barred their escape from the doom of rebirth in hell and the animal world. Knowing this, the Teacher set forth the lessons of virtue and showed the danger of such thoughtless use of things, exhorting them to be careful in the use of the Four Requisites, and laying down this rule, âThe thoughtful monk has a definite object in view when he wears a robe, namely, to keep off the cold.â After laying down similar rules for the other Requisites, he concluded by saying: âSuch is the thoughtful use which should be made of the Four Requisites. Thoughtlessly to use them is like taking deadly poison; and there were those in bygone days who through their thoughtlessness did inadvertently take poison, to their exceeding hurt in due season.â So saying he told this story of the past.

The person, not knowing, swallowed dice smeared with powerful poison, swallow, swallow, wicked gambler, later there will be pain for you.

His lesson ended, the Teacher said: âMonks, the thoughtless use of things is like the thoughtless taking of deadly poison.â So saying, he identified the JÄtaka in these words, âI was myself the wise and good gambler of those days.â

## Full Story
âIn battle they wish for a hero.â
 
 {1.381}
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about the venerable Änanda.


Once the wives of the king of Kosala thought among themselves, as follows, âVery rare is the coming of a Buddha; and very rare is birth in a human form with all oneâs faculties in perfection. Yet, though we have happened on a human form in a Buddhaâs lifetime, we cannot go at will to the monastery to hear the 
[1.223]
 truth from his own lips, to do obeisance, and to make offerings to him. We live here as in a box. Let us ask the king to send for a fitting monk to come here and teach us the truth. Let us learn what we can from him, and be charitable and do good works, to the end that we may profit by our having been born at this happy juncture.â So they all went in a body to the king, and told him what was in their minds; and the king gave his consent.


Now it fell out on a day that the king was minded to take his pleasure in the royal pleasure gardens, and gave orders that the grounds should be made ready for his coming. As the gardener was working away, he espied the Teacher seated at the foot of a tree. So he went to the king and said: âThe pleasure gardens is made ready, sire; but the Fortunate One is sitting there at the foot of a tree.â âVery good,â said the king, âwe will go and hear the Teacher.â Mounting his chariot of state, he went to the Teacher in the pleasure gardens.


Now there was then seated at the Teacherâs feet, listening to his teaching, a lay brother named ChattapÄá¹i [Parasol Holder], who had entered the Third Path. On catching sight of this lay brother, the king hesitated; but, on reflection that this must be a virtuous man, or he would not be sitting by the Teacher for instruction, he approached and with a bow seated himself on one side of the Teacher. Out of reverence for the supreme Buddha, the lay brother neither rose in the kingâs honour nor saluted his majesty; and this made the king very angry. Noticing the kingâs displeasure, the Teacher proceeded to extol the merits of that lay brother, saying: âSire, this lay brother is master of all tradition; he knows by heart the discourses that have been handed down; and he has set himself free from the bondage of passion.â âSurely,â thought the king, âhe whose praises the Teacher is telling can be no ordinary person.â And he said to him, âLet me know, lay brother, if you are in need of anything.â âThank you,â said the man. Then the king listened to the Teacherâs teaching, and at its close rose up and ceremoniously withdrew.


Another day, meeting that same lay brother going after breakfast umbrella in hand to Jetavana, the king had him summoned to his presence and said: âI hear, lay brother, that you are a man of great learning. Now my wives are very anxious to hear and learn the truth; I should be glad if you would teach them.â âIt is not meet, sire, that a layman 
{1.382}
 should expound or teach the truth in the kingâs harem; that is the prerogative of the monks.â


Recognising the force of this remark, the king, after dismissing the layman, called his wives together and announced to them his intention of sending to the Teacher for one of the monks to come as their instructor in the Dhamma. Which of the eighty chief disciples would they have? After talking it over together, the ladies with one accord chose Änanda 
Änanda held âadvanced views on the woman question.â It was he who persuaded the reluctant Buddha into admitting women to the Saá¹gha, as recorded in the 
Vinaya
 (
Sacred Books of the East
 xx, 320 et seq.).
 the elder, surnamed the Treasurer of the Dhamma [Dhammabhaá¹á¸ÄgÄrika]. So the king went to the Teacher and with a courteous greeting sat down by his side, after which he proceeded to state his wivesâ wish, and his own hope, that Änanda might be their teacher. The Teacher, having consented to send Änanda, the kingâs wives now began to be regularly taught by the elder and to learn from him.


One day the jewel out of the kingâs turban was missing. When the king heard of the loss he sent for his ministers and bade them seize everyone who had access to the precincts and find the jewel. So the Ministers searched everybody, women and all, for the missing jewel, till they had worried everybody almost out of their lives; but no trace of it could they find. That day Änanda came to the palace, only to find the kingâs wives as dejected as they had hitherto been delighted when he taught them. âWhat has made you like this today?â asked the elder. âOh, sir,â they said, âthe king has lost the jewel out of his turban; and by his orders the ministers are worrying everybody, women and all, out of their lives, in order to find it. We canât say what may not happen to any one of us; and that is why we are so sad.â âDonât think 
[1.224]
 any more about it,â said the elder cheerily, as he went to find the king.


Taking the seat set for him, the elder asked whether it was true that his majesty had lost his jewel. âQuite true, sir,â said the king. âAnd can it not be found?â âI have had all the inmates of the palaces worried out of their lives, and yet I canât find it.â âThere is one way, sire, to find it, without worrying people out of their lives.â âWhat way is that, sir?â âBy wisp-giving, sire.â âWisp-giving? What may that be, pray?â âCall together, sire, all the persons you suspect, and privately give each one of them separately a wisp of straw, or a lump of clay will do, saying, âTake this and put it in such and such a place tomorrow at daybreak.â The man that took the jewel will put it in the straw or clay, and so bring it back. If it be brought back the very first day, well and good. If not, the same thing must be done on the second and third days. In this way, a large number of persons will escape worry, and you will get your jewel back.â With these words the elder departed.


Following the above counsel, the king caused the straw and clay to be dealt out for three successive days; but yet the jewel was not recovered. 
{1.383}
 On the third day the elder came again, and asked whether the jewel had been brought back. âNo, sir,â said the king. âThen, sire, you must have a large waterpot set in a retired corner of your courtyard, and you must have the pot filled with water and a screen put up before it. Then give orders that all who frequent the precincts, men and women alike, are to put off their outer-garments, and one by one wash their hands behind the screen and then come back.â With this advice the elder departed. And the king did as he bade.


Thought the thief, âÄnanda has seriously taken the matter in hand; and, if he does not find the jewel, heâll not let things rest here. The time has really come to give the jewel up without more ado.â So he secreted the jewel about his person, and going behind the screen, dropped it in the water before he went away. When everyone had gone, the pot was emptied, and the jewel found. âItâs all owing to the elder,â exclaimed the king in his joy, âthat I have got my jewel back, and that without worrying a host of people out of their lives.â And all the persons about the precincts were equally grateful to Änanda for the trouble he had saved them from.


The story how Änandaâs marvellous powers had found the jewel, spread through all the city, till it reached the Saá¹gha. Said the monks, âThe great knowledge, learning, and the skill in means of the elder Änanda have been the means at once of recovering the lost jewel and of saving many persons from being worried out of their lives.â


And as they sat together in the Dhamma Hall, singing the praises of Änanda, the Teacher entered and asked the subject of their conversation. Being told, he said: âMonks, this is not the first time that what had been stolen has been found, nor is Änanda the only one who has brought about such a discovery. In bygone days too the wise and good discovered what had been stolen away, and also saved a host of people from trouble, showing that the lost property had fallen into the hands of animals.â So saying, he told this story of the past.

In battle they wish for a hero; in advice for clarity; in food and drink for a friend; when need arises for a wise one.

His lesson ended, the Teacher, after extolling the elderâs merits, identified the JÄtaka by saying: âÄnanda was the king of those days and I his wise counsellor.â

## Full Story
âDo not trust the untrustworthy.â
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about taking things on trust.


Tradition tells us that in those days the monks, for the most part, used to rest content if anything was given them by their mothers or fathers, brothers or sisters, or uncles or aunts, or other kinsfolk. Arguing that in their lay state they had as a matter of course received things from the same hands, they, as monks, 
[1.228]
 likewise showed no circumspection or caution before using food, clothing and other requisites which their relations gave them. Observing this the Teacher felt that he must read the monks a lesson. So he called them together, and said: âMonks, no matter whether 
{1.388}
 the giver be a relation or not, let circumspection accompany use. The monk who without circumspection uses the requisites which are given to him, may entail on himself a subsequent existence as a Yakkha or as a ghost. Use without circumspection is like unto taking poison; and poison kills just the same, whether it be given by a relative or by a stranger. There were those who in bygone days actually did take poison because it was offered by those near and dear to them, and thereby they met their end.â So saying, he told the following story of the past.

Do not trust the untrustworthy, in the trustworthy do not trust, there is danger following trust, like the lion and the hare-deer.

His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka by saying: âI was the merchant of those days.â

âScorched with heat, soaked with water.â
 
[1.229]
 This story the Teacher told while at PÄá¹­ikÄrÄma near VesÄli, about Sunakkhatta.


For at that time Sunakkhatta, having become an adherent of the Teacher, was travelling about the country as a monk with bowl and robes, when he was perverted to the tenets of Kora the Noble [Korakhattiya]. So he returned to the One with Ten Powers his bowl and robes and reverted to a lay life by reason of Kora the Noble, about the time when this latter had been reborn as the offspring of the KÄlakaÃ±jaka Asura. And he went about within the three walls of VesÄli defaming the Teacher by affirming that there was nothing superhuman about the ascetic Gotama, who was not distinguished from other men by preaching a dispensation which leads to safety; that the ascetic Gotama had simply worked out a system which was the outcome of his own individual thought and study; and that the ideal for the attainment of which his Dhamma was preached, did not lead to the destruction of sorrow in those who followed it. 
This is a quotation from the MN i. 68 [MN 11 CÅ«á¸·asÄ«hanÄdasutta].


Now the venerable SÄriputta was on his round for alms when he heard Sunakkhattaâs blasphemies; and on his return from his round he reported this to the Fortunate One. Said the Teacher, âSunakkhatta is a hot-headed person, SÄriputta, and speaks idle words. His hot-headedness has led him to talk like this and to deny the saving grace of my Dhamma. Unwittingly, this foolish person is extolling me; I say unwittingly, for he has no knowledge 
{1.390}
 of my efficacy. In me, SÄriputta, dwell the Six Super Knowledges, and herein am I more than human; the Ten Powers are within me, and the Four Grounds of Confidence. I know the limits of the four types of earthly existence and the five states of possible rebirth after earthly death. This too is a superhuman quality in me; and whoso denies it must retract his words, change his belief, and renounce his heresy, or he will without ado be cast into hell.â


Having thus magnified the superhuman nature and power which existed within him, the Teacher went on to say, âSunakkhatta, I hear, SÄriputta, took delight in the misguided self-mortifications of the asceticism of Kora the Noble; and therefore it was that he could take no pleasure in me. Ninety-one aeons ago I lived the higher life in all its four forms, 
i.e.
 as a learner, householder, 
rÃ©ligieux
, and recluse.
 examining into that false asceticism to discover whether the truth abode therein. An ascetic was I, the chief of ascetics; worn and emaciated was I, beyond all others; loathing of comfort had I, a loathing surpassing that of all others; I dwelt apart, and unapproachable was my passion for solitude.â Then, at the elderâs request, he told this story of the past.

Scorched with heat, soaked with water, heâs alone in the terrifying woods, naked, not seated near the fire, the sage is engaged in the search. 
{1.391}

His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka by saying: âI was the naked ascetic of those days.â

âWhen the TathÄgata was dwelling at Jetavana,â thought the Teacher, âthe elder SÄriputta, who was born in NÄla village, died at Varaka in the month of KattikÄ, when the moon was at the full; and in the self-same month, when the

Then said the elder Änanda, âO Fortunate One, suffer not your end to be in this sorry little town, this rough little town in the jungle, this little suburban town. Shall not RÄjagaha or some other large city be the death-place of the Buddha?â


âNay, Änanda,â said the Teacher, âcall not this a sorry little town, a rough little town in the jungle, a little suburban town. In bygone days, in the days of Sudassanaâs Universal Monarchy, it was in this town that I had my dwelling. It was then a mighty city encompassed by jewelled walls

## Full Story
âLike one would take care of a bowl of oil.â
 This story was told by the Teacher while dwelling in a forest near the town of Desaka in the Sumbha country, concerning the JanapadakalyÄá¹isutta. 
[SN 47.20.] A PÄli summary of it has been left untranslated, as adding little or nothing to the above âStory of the Present.â
 For on that occasion the Fortunate One said: âJust as if, monks, a great crowd were to gather together, crying âHail to the Belle of the Land! Hail to the Belle of the Land!â and just as if in like manner a greater crowd were to gather together, crying âThe Belle of the Land is singing and dancing;â and then suppose there came a man fond of life, fearful of death, fond of pleasure, and averse to pain, and suppose such a one were addressed as follows â âHi, there! You are to carry this pot of oil, which is full to the brim, between the crowd and the Belle of the Land; a man with a drawn sword will follow in your footsteps; and if you spill a single drop, he will cut off your head;â what think you, monks? Would that man, under these circumstances, be careless, and take no pains in carrying that pot of oil?â âBy no manner of means, sir.â âThis is an allegory, 
{1.394}
 which I framed to make my 
[1.233]
 meaning clear, monks; and here is its meaning: The brimming pot of oil typifies a collected state of mind as regards things concerning the body, and the lesson to be learned is that such mindfulness should be practised and perfected. Fail not in this, monks.â So saying, the Teacher gave forth the Sutta concerning the Belle of the Land, with both text and interpretation. 
{1.395}
 Then, by way of application, the Fortunate One went on to say, âA monk desirous of practising right mindfulness concerning the body, should be as careful not to let his mindfulness drop, as the man in the allegory was not to let drop the pot of oil.â


When they had heard the Sutta and its meaning, the monks said: âIt was a hard task, sir, for the man to pass by with the pot of oil without gazing on the charms of the Belle of the Land.â âNot hard at all, monks; it was quite an easy task â easy for the very good reason that he was escorted along by one who threatened him with a drawn sword. But it was a truly hard task for the wise and good of bygone days to preserve right mindfulness and to curb their passions so as not to look at celestial beauty in all its perfection. Still they triumphed, and passing on won a kingdom.â So saying, he told this story of the past.

His story told, the Teacher, after Fully Awakening, uttered this verse: 
{1.400}

Like one would take care of a bowl of oil, one which is completely full to the brim, so should one protect oneâs own mind, like one wishing for a goal not gone to before. 
{1.401}

When the Teacher had thus led up to the highest point of instruction, which is Arahatship, he identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThe Buddhaâs disciples were in those days the kingâs courtiers, and I the prince that won a kingdom.â

{1.402}
 And the monks used to call to him, âHere, brother Wicked!â and, âStay, brother Wicked,â till he resolved that, as âWickedâ gave the idea of incarnate wrongdoing and ill-luck, he would change his name to one of better omen. Accordingly he asked his teachers and preceptors to give him a new name. But they said that a name only served to denote, and did not impute qualities; and they bade him rest content with the name he had. Time after time he renewed his request, till the whole Saá¹gha knew what importance he attached to a mere name. And as they sat discussing the matter in the Dhamma Hall, the Teacher entered and asked what it was they were speaking about. Being told, he said: âThis is not the first time this monk has believed luck went by names; he was equally dissatisfied with the name he bore in a former age.â So saying he told this story of the past.

Having seen Life lying dead, Wealthy who was poor, and Guide lost in the wood, Wicked came home again.

His story told, the Teacher said: âSo you see, monks, that in former days as now this monk imagined there was a great deal in a name.â And he identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThis monk who is discontent with his name was the discontented young brahmin of those days; the Buddhaâs disciples were the pupils; and I myself their master.â

 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a cheating merchant. There were two merchants in partnership at SÄvatthi, we are told, who travelled with their merchandise and came back with the proceeds. And the cheating merchant thought to himself, âMy partner has been badly fed and badly lodged for so many days past that he will die of indigestion now he has got home again and can feast to his heartâs content on dainties manifold. My plan is to divide what we have made into three portions, giving one to his orphans and keeping two for myself.â And with this object he made some excuse day by day for putting off the division of the profits.


Finding that it was in vain to press for a division, the honest partner went to the Teacher at the monastery, made his salutation, and was received kindly. âIt is a very long time,â said the Buddha, âsince you last came to see me.â And hereupon the merchant told the Teacher what had befallen him.


âThis is not the first time, lay-follower,â said the Teacher, âthat this man has been a cheating merchant; he was no less a cheat in times past. As he tries to defraud you now, so did he try to defraud the wise and good of other days.â So saying, at the merchantâs request, the Teacher told this story of the past.

Wise is certainly good, but not so Superwise,  through my son Superwise, I am well-nigh roasted.

âThus you see,â said the Teacher, âthat your partner was as great a cheat in past times as now.â Having ended his story, he identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThe cheating merchant of today was the cheating merchant in the story, and I the honest merchant named Wise.â

âOf those who gathered, more than a thousand.â
 This story was told by the Teacher when at Jetavana, concerning the question of the unconverted. 
{1.406}
 (The incidents will be related in the SarabhamigajÄtaka [Ja 483.]) 
[See Ja 483 
SarabhamigajÄtaka
. I include the story here.]

At that time the Teacher put a question concisely to that elder. This is the full story, put briefly, of the descent from the world of gods. When the venerable Piá¹á¸ola BhÄradvÄja had by his Supernormal Powers gained the sandalwood bowl in the presence of the great merchant of RÄjagaha, the Teacher forbade the monks to use their miraculous Supernormal Powers.


Then the schismatics thought: âThe ascetic Gotama has forbidden the use of miraculous Supernormal Powers: now he will do no miracle himself.â Their disciples were disturbed, and said to the schismatics, âWhy didnât you take the bowl by your Supernormal Powers?â They replied, âThis is no hard thing for us, friend. But we think, âWho will display before the laity his own fine and subtle powers for the sake of a paltry wooden bowl?â and so we did not take it. The ascetics of the Sakya class took it, and showed their Supernormal Powers for sheer foolish greed. Do not imagine it is any trouble to us to work miracles. Suppose we leave out of consideration the disciples of Gotama the ascetic: if we like, we too will show our Supernormal Powers with the ascetic Gotama himself: if the ascetic Gotama works one miracle, we will work one twice as good.â


The monks who heard this told the Fortunate One of it, âSir, the schismatics say they will work a miracle.â Said the Teacher, âLet them do it, monks; I will do the like.â BimbisÄra, hearing this, went and asked the Fortunate One, âWill you work a miracle, sir?â âYes, O king.â âWas there not a command given on this matter, sir?â âThe command, O king, was given to my disciples; there is no command which can rule the Buddhas. When the flowers and fruit in your park are forbidden to others, the same rule does not apply to you.â âThen where will you work this miracle, sir?â âAt SÄvatthi, under Gaá¹á¸aâs mango tree.â âWhat have I to do, then?â âNothing, sire.â


Next day, after breaking his fast, the Teacher went to seek alms. âWhither goes the Teacher?â asked the people. The monks answered to them, âAt the gate of the city of SÄvatthi, beneath Gaá¹á¸aâs mango tree, he is to work a twofold miracle to the confounding of the schismatics.â The crowd said: âThis miracle will be what they call a masterpiece; we will go see it,â leaving the doors of their houses, they went along with the Teacher. Some of the schismatics also followed the Teacher, with their disciples, âWe too,â they said, âwill work a miracle, in the place where the ascetic Gotama shall work his.â


By and by the Teacher arrived at SÄvatthi. The king asked him, âIs it true, sir, you are about to work a miracle, as they say?â âYes, it is true,â he said. âWhen?â asked the king. âOn the seventh day from now, at the full moon of the month of July.â âShall I set up a pavilion, sir?â âPeace, great king: in the place where I shall work my miracle Sakka will set up a pavilion of jewels twelve leagues in compass.â âShall I proclaim this thing through the city, sir?â âProclaim it, O king.â The king sent forth the announcer of the Dhamma on an elephant richly caparisoned, to proclaim thus, âNews! The Teacher is about to perform a miracle, for the confounding of the schismatics, at the Gate of SÄvatthi, under Gaá¹á¸aâs mango tree, seven days from now!â Each day was this proclamation made. When the schismatics heard this news, that the miracle will be done under Gaá¹á¸aâs mango tree, they had all the mango trees near to SÄvatthi cut down, paying the owners for them.


On the night of the full moon the announcer of the Dhamma made proclamation, âThis day in the morning the miracle will take place.â By the power of the gods it was as though all JambudÄ«pa was at the door and heard the proclamation; whosoever had it in his heart to go, they all betook themselves to SÄvatthi: for twelve leagues the crowd extended.


Early in the morning the Teacher went on his rounds seeking alms. The kingâs gardener, Gaá¹á¸a by name, was just taking to the king a fine ripe mango fruit; thoroughly ripe, big as a bushel, when he espied the Teacher at the city gate. âThis fruit is worthy of the TathÄgata,â said he, and gave it to him. The Teacher took it, and sitting down then and there on one side, ate the fruit. When it was eaten, he said: âÄnanda, give the gardener this stone to plant here on the spot; this shall be Gaá¹á¸aâs mango tree.â The elder did so.


The gardener dug a hole in the earth, and planted it. On the instant the stone burst, roots sprouted forth, up sprang a red shoot tall as a plough-pole; even as the crowd stared it grew into a mango tree of a hundred cubits, with a trunk fifty cubits and branches of fifty cubits in height; at the same time flowers bloomed, fruit ripened; the tree stood filling the sky, covered with bees, laden with golden fruit; when the wind blew on it, sweet fruits fell; then the monks came up and ate of the fruit, and retired.


In the evening time the King of the Devas, reflecting, perceived that it was a task laid on him to make a pavilion of the seven precious things. So he sent the Devaputta Vissakamma, and caused him to make a pavilion of the seven precious things, twelve leagues in compass, covered all over with blue lotus. Thus the gods of ten thousand spheres were gathered together. The Teacher, for the confounding of the schismatics having performed a twofold miracle passing marvellous among his disciples, caused faith to spring up in multitudes, then arose and, sitting in the Buddhaâs seat, declared the Dhamma. Twenty crores of beings drank of the waters of life. Then, meditating to see whither it was that former Buddhas went when they had done a miracle, and perceiving that it was to the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, up he rose from the Buddhaâs seat, the right foot he placed on the top of Mount Yugandhara, and with his left strode to the peak of Sineru, he began the Rains Retreat under the great Coral Tree, seated upon the yellow-stone throne; for the space of three months he discoursed upon the Abhidhamma to the gods.


The people knew not the place whither the Teacher had gone; they looked, and said: âLet us go home,â and lived in that place during the rainy season. When the rainy season was near to its end, and the feast was at hand, the great elder MoggallÄna went and announced it to the Fortunate One. Thereupon the Teacher asked him, âWhere is SÄriputta now?â âHe, sir, after the miracle which delighted him, remained with five hundred monks in the city of Saá¹kassa, and is there still.â âMoggallÄna, on the seventh day from now I shall descend by the gate of Saá¹kassa. Let those who desire to behold the TathÄgata assemble in the city of Saá¹kassa.â The elder assented, went and told the people: the whole company he transported from SÄvatthi to Saá¹kassa, a distance of thirty leagues, in the twinkling of an eye.


The Rains Retreat over, and the Invitation celebrated, the Teacher told king Sakka that he was about to return to the world of men. Then Sakka sent for Vissakamma, and said to him, âMake a stairway for the One with Ten Powers to descend into the world of men.â He placed the head of the stairway upon the peak of Sineru, and the foot of it by the gate of Saá¹kassa, and between he made three stairways side by side: one of gems, one of silver, and one of gold: the balustrade and cornice were of the seven things of price. The Teacher, having performed a miracle for the worldâs emancipation, descended by the midmost stair made out of gems. Sakka carried the bowl and robe, SuyÄma a yakâs-tail fan, Brahma Lord of all beings bore a sunshade, and the deities of the ten thousand spheres worshipped with divine garlands and perfumes. When the Teacher stood at the foot of the staircase, first elder SÄriputta gave him greeting, afterwards the rest of the company.


Amidst this assembly the Teacher thought: âMoggallÄna has been shown to possess supernatural power, UpÄli as one who is versed in the sacred law, but the quality of high wisdom possessed by SÄriputta has not been shown. Save and except me, no other possesses wisdom so full and complete as his; I will make known the quality of his wisdom.â First of all he asked a question which is put to ordinary persons, and the ordinary persons answered it. Then he asked a question within the scope of those of the First Path, and this they of the First Path answered, but the ordinary folk knew nought of it. In the same way he asked questions in turn within the scope of those of the Second and Third Paths, of the Arahats, of the chief disciples; and in each case those who were below each grade in turn were unable to answer, but they who were above could answer. Then he put a question within the power of SÄriputta, and this the elder could answer, but the others not so. The people asked, âWho is this elder who answered the Teacher?â They were told, it was the Captain of the Dhamma, and SÄriputta was his name. âAh, great is his wisdom!â they said. Ever afterwards the quality of the elderâs great wisdom was known to men and to gods. Then the Teacher said to him,

âSome have probations yet to pass, and some have reached the goal:

Their different behaviours say, for you do know the whole.â

Having thus asked a question which comes within a Buddhaâs scope, he added, âHere is a point put with brevity, SÄriputta; what is the meaning of the matter in all its bearings?â The elder considered the problem. He thought: âThe Teacher asks of the proper behaviour with which the monks attain progress, both those who are in the lower Paths and those who are Arahats?â As to the general question, he had no doubt. But then he considered, âThe proper manner of behaviour may be described in many ways of speaking according to the essential elements of being, and so forth from that beginning; now in what fashion can I hit the Teacherâs meaning?â He was doubtful about the meaning. The Teacher thought: âSÄriputta has no doubt of the general question, but doubts what particular side of it I have in view. If I give no clue, he will never be able to answer, so a clue I will give him.â This clue he gave by saying: âSee here, SÄriputta: you grant this to be true?â (mentioning some point). SÄriputta granted the point.


The hint thus given, he knew that SÄriputta had taken his meaning, and would answer fully, starting from the very elements of being. Then the question stood out clear before the elder, as with a hundred hints, nay, a thousand; and he, at the Teacherâs hint given, answered the question which belonged to a Buddhaâs scope.

On a certain occasion the monks met in the Dhamma Hall and praised the wisdom of SÄriputta, the Captain of the Dhamma, who had expounded the meaning of the One with Ten Powersâ pithy saying. Entering the hall, the Teacher asked and was told what the monks were talking about. âThis is not the first time, monks,â said he, âthat the meaning of a pithy saying of mine has been brought out by SÄriputta. He did the like in times gone by.â So saying, he told this story of the past.

Of those who gathered, more than a thousand who were unwise might cry a hundred years, but one person with wisdom is better, one who knows the meaning of what is said.

His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka by saying: âSÄriputta was the chief disciple of those days, and I MahÄbrahma.â

## Full Story
âThe disagreeable having agreeable form.â
 
 [1.242]
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Kuá¹á¸adhÄnavana near the city of Kuá¹á¸iya about SuppavÄsÄ, a lay-sister, who was daughter to king Koliya. For at that time, she, who had carried a child seven years in her womb, was in the seventh day of her throes, and her pains were grievous. In spite of all her agony, she thought as follows, âFully Awakened is the Fortunate One who preaches the Dhamma to the end that such suffering may cease; righteous are the disciples of the Fortunate One who so walk that such suffering may cease; blessed is NibbÄna wherein such suffering does cease.â These three thoughts were her consolation in her pangs. And she sent her husband to the Buddha to tell her state and bear a greeting for her.


Her message was given to the Fortunate One, who said, 
{1.408}
 âMay SuppavÄsÄ, daughter of the king of the Koliyas, grow strong and well again, and bear a healthy child.â And at the word of the Fortunate One, SuppavÄsÄ, daughter of the king of the Koliyas, became well and strong, and bore a healthy child. Finding on his return that his wife had been safely delivered, the husband marvelled greatly at the exalted powers of the Buddha.


Now that her child was born, SuppavÄsÄ was eager to show bounty for seven days to the Saá¹gha with the Buddha at its head, and sent her husband back to invite them. Now it chanced that at that time the Saá¹gha with the Buddha at its head had received an invitation from the layman who supported the elder MoggallÄna the Great; but the Teacher, wishing to gratify SuppavÄsÄâs charitable desires, sent to the elder to explain the matter, and with the Saá¹gha accepted for seven days the hospitality of SuppavÄsÄ. On the seventh day she dressed up her little boy, whose name was SÄ«vali, and made him bow before the Buddha and the Saá¹gha. And when he was brought in due course to SÄriputta, the elder in all kindness greeted the infant, saying: âWell, SÄ«vali, is all well with you?â âHow could it be, sir?â said the infant. âSeven long years have I had to wallow in blood.â


Then in joy SuppavÄsÄ exclaimed, âMy child, only seven days old, is actually discoursing on the dispensation with the apostle SÄriputta, the Captain of the Dhamma!â


âWould you like another such a child?â asked the Teacher. âYes, sir,â said SuppavÄsÄ, âseven more, if I could have them like him.â With an exalted utterance the Teacher gave thanks for SuppavÄsÄâs hospitality and departed.


At seven years of age the child SÄ«vali gave his heart to the dispensation and forsook the world to join the Saá¹gha; at twenty he was admitted a full monk. He was righteous and won the crown of righteousness which is Arahatship, and the earth shouted aloud for joy.


So one day the assembled monks talked with one another in the Dhamma Hall respecting the matter, saying: âThe elder SÄ«vali, who is now so shining a light, was the child of many prayers; seven long years was he in the womb and seven days in birth. How great must have been the pains of mother and child! Of what deeds were their pains the fruit?â


Entering the hall, the Teacher asked the subject of their discourse. âMonks,â said he, âthe righteous SÄ«vali 
{1.409}
 was seven years in the womb and seven days in birth all because of his own past deeds. And similarly SuppavÄsÄâs seven yearsâ pregnancy and seven daysâ travail resulted from her own past deeds.â So saying, he told this story of the past.
 [1.243]

His story ended, the Teacher, after Fully Awakening, repeated this verse:

The disagreeable having agreeable form, the unlovely having lovely form, the painful having the form of pleasure, will overcome the one who is heedless.

And when he had taught this lesson, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka by saying: âSÄ«vali was the prince who in those days blockaded the city, and became king; SuppavÄsÄ was his mother, and I his father, the king of Benares.â

## Full Story
This story is in all respects analogous to the ParosahassajÄtaka [Ja 99], with the sole difference that âthink hardâ is read here. 
[Everything down to the verse is reproduced from Ja 99.]

At that time the Teacher put a question concisely to that elder. This is the full story, put briefly, of the descent from the world of gods. When the venerable Piá¹á¸ola BhÄradvÄja had by his Supernormal Powers gained the sandalwood bowl in the presence of the great merchant of RÄjagaha, the Teacher forbade the monks to use their miraculous Supernormal Powers.


Then the schismatics thought: âThe ascetic Gotama has forbidden the use of miraculous Supernormal Powers: now he will do no miracle himself.â Their disciples were disturbed, and said to the schismatics, âWhy didnât you take the bowl by your Supernormal Powers?â They replied, âThis is no hard thing for us, friend. But we think, âWho will display before the laity his own fine and subtle powers for the sake of a paltry wooden bowl?â and so we did not take it. The ascetics of the Sakya class took it, and showed their Supernormal Powers for sheer foolish greed. Do not imagine it is any trouble to us to work miracles. Suppose we leave out of consideration the disciples of Gotama the ascetic: if we like, we too will show our Supernormal Powers with the ascetic Gotama himself: if the ascetic Gotama works one miracle, we will work one twice as good.â


The monks who heard this told the Fortunate One of it, âSir, the schismatics say they will work a miracle.â Said the Teacher, âLet them do it, monks; I will do the like.â BimbisÄra, hearing this, went and asked the Fortunate One, âWill you work a miracle, sir?â âYes, O king.â âWas there not a command given on this matter, sir?â âThe command, O king, was given to my disciples; there is no command which can rule the Buddhas. When the flowers and fruit in your park are forbidden to others, the same rule does not apply to you.â âThen where will you work this miracle, sir?â âAt SÄvatthi, under Gaá¹á¸aâs mango tree.â âWhat have I to do, then?â âNothing, sire.â


Next day, after breaking his fast, the Teacher went to seek alms. âWhither goes the Teacher?â asked the people. The monks answered to them, âAt the gate of the city of SÄvatthi, beneath Gaá¹á¸aâs mango tree, he is to work a twofold miracle to the confounding of the schismatics.â The crowd said: âThis miracle will be what they call a masterpiece; we will go see it,â leaving the doors of their houses, they went along with the Teacher. Some of the schismatics also followed the Teacher, with their disciples, âWe too,â they said, âwill work a miracle, in the place where the ascetic Gotama shall work his.â


By and by the Teacher arrived at SÄvatthi. The king asked him, âIs it true, sir, you are about to work a miracle, as they say?â âYes, it is true,â he said. âWhen?â asked the king. âOn the seventh day from now, at the full moon of the month of July.â âShall I set up a pavilion, sir?â âPeace, great king: in the place where I shall work my miracle Sakka will set up a pavilion of jewels twelve leagues in compass.â âShall I proclaim this thing through the city, sir?â âProclaim it, O king.â The king sent forth the announcer of the Dhamma on an elephant richly caparisoned, to proclaim thus, âNews! The Teacher is about to perform a miracle, for the confounding of the schismatics, at the Gate of SÄvatthi, under Gaá¹á¸aâs mango tree, seven days from now!â Each day was this proclamation made. When the schismatics heard this news, that the miracle will be done under Gaá¹á¸aâs mango tree, they had all the mango trees near to SÄvatthi cut down, paying the owners for them.


On the night of the full moon the announcer of the Dhamma made proclamation, âThis day in the morning the miracle will take place.â By the power of the gods it was as though all JambudÄ«pa was at the door and heard the proclamation; whosoever had it in his heart to go, they all betook themselves to SÄvatthi: for twelve leagues the crowd extended.


Early in the morning the Teacher went on his rounds seeking alms. The kingâs gardener, Gaá¹á¸a by name, was just taking to the king a fine ripe mango fruit; thoroughly ripe, big as a bushel, when he espied the Teacher at the city gate. âThis fruit is worthy of the TathÄgata,â said he, and gave it to him. The Teacher took it, and sitting down then and there on one side, ate the fruit. When it was eaten, he said: âÄnanda, give the gardener this stone to plant here on the spot; this shall be Gaá¹á¸aâs mango tree.â The elder did so.


The gardener dug a hole in the earth, and planted it. On the instant the stone burst, roots sprouted forth, up sprang a red shoot tall as a plough-pole; even as the crowd stared it grew into a mango tree of a hundred cubits, with a trunk fifty cubits and branches of fifty cubits in height; at the same time flowers bloomed, fruit ripened; the tree stood filling the sky, covered with bees, laden with golden fruit; when the wind blew on it, sweet fruits fell; then the monks came up and ate of the fruit, and retired.


In the evening time the King of the Devas, reflecting, perceived that it was a task laid on him to make a pavilion of the seven precious things. So he sent the Devaputta Vissakamma, and caused him to make a pavilion of the seven precious things, twelve leagues in compass, covered all over with blue lotus. Thus the gods of ten thousand spheres were gathered together. The Teacher, for the confounding of the schismatics having performed a twofold miracle passing marvellous among his disciples, caused faith to spring up in multitudes, then arose and, sitting in the Buddhaâs seat, declared the Dhamma. Twenty crores of beings drank of the waters of life. Then, meditating to see whither it was that former Buddhas went when they had done a miracle, and perceiving that it was to the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, up he rose from the Buddhaâs seat, the right foot he placed on the top of Mount Yugandhara, and with his left strode to the peak of Sineru, he began the Rains Retreat under the great Coral Tree, seated upon the yellow-stone throne; for the space of three months he discoursed upon the Abhidhamma to the gods.


The people knew not the place whither the Teacher had gone; they looked, and said: âLet us go home,â and lived in that place during the rainy season. When the rainy season was near to its end, and the feast was at hand, the great elder MoggallÄna went and announced it to the Fortunate One. Thereupon the Teacher asked him, âWhere is SÄriputta now?â âHe, sir, after the miracle which delighted him, remained with five hundred monks in the city of Saá¹kassa, and is there still.â âMoggallÄna, on the seventh day from now I shall descend by the gate of Saá¹kassa. Let those who desire to behold the TathÄgata assemble in the city of Saá¹kassa.â The elder assented, went and told the people: the whole company he transported from SÄvatthi to Saá¹kassa, a distance of thirty leagues, in the twinkling of an eye.


The Rains Retreat over, and the Invitation celebrated, the Teacher told king Sakka that he was about to return to the world of men. Then Sakka sent for Vissakamma, and said to him, âMake a stairway for the One with Ten Powers to descend into the world of men.â He placed the head of the stairway upon the peak of Sineru, and the foot of it by the gate of Saá¹kassa, and between he made three stairways side by side: one of gems, one of silver, and one of gold: the balustrade and cornice were of the seven things of price. The Teacher, having performed a miracle for the worldâs emancipation, descended by the midmost stair made out of gems. Sakka carried the bowl and robe, SuyÄma a yakâs-tail fan, Brahma Lord of all beings bore a sunshade, and the deities of the ten thousand spheres worshipped with divine garlands and perfumes. When the Teacher stood at the foot of the staircase, first elder SÄriputta gave him greeting, afterwards the rest of the company.


Amidst this assembly the Teacher thought: âMoggallÄna has been shown to possess supernatural power, UpÄli as one who is versed in the sacred law, but the quality of high wisdom possessed by SÄriputta has not been shown. Save and except me, no other possesses wisdom so full and complete as his; I will make known the quality of his wisdom.â First of all he asked a question which is put to ordinary persons, and the ordinary persons answered it. Then he asked a question within the scope of those of the First Path, and this they of the First Path answered, but the ordinary folk knew nought of it. In the same way he asked questions in turn within the scope of those of the Second and Third Paths, of the Arahats, of the chief disciples; and in each case those who were below each grade in turn were unable to answer, but they who were above could answer. Then he put a question within the power of SÄriputta, and this the elder could answer, but the others not so. The people asked, âWho is this elder who answered the Teacher?â They were told, it was the Captain of the Dhamma, and SÄriputta was his name. âAh, great is his wisdom!â they said. Ever afterwards the quality of the elderâs great wisdom was known to men and to gods. Then the Teacher said to him,

âSome have probations yet to pass, and some have reached the goal:

Their different behaviours say, for you do know the whole.â

Having thus asked a question which comes within a Buddhaâs scope, he added, âHere is a point put with brevity, SÄriputta; what is the meaning of the matter in all its bearings?â The elder considered the problem. He thought: âThe Teacher asks of the proper behaviour with which the monks attain progress, both those who are in the lower Paths and those who are Arahats?â As to the general question, he had no doubt. But then he considered, âThe proper manner of behaviour may be described in many ways of speaking according to the essential elements of being, and so forth from that beginning; now in what fashion can I hit the Teacherâs meaning?â He was doubtful about the meaning. The Teacher thought: âSÄriputta has no doubt of the general question, but doubts what particular side of it I have in view. If I give no clue, he will never be able to answer, so a clue I will give him.â This clue he gave by saying: âSee here, SÄriputta: you grant this to be true?â (mentioning some point). SÄriputta granted the point.


The hint thus given, he knew that SÄriputta had taken his meaning, and would answer fully, starting from the very elements of being. Then the question stood out clear before the elder, as with a hundred hints, nay, a thousand; and he, at the Teacherâs hint given, answered the question which belonged to a Buddhaâs scope.


On a certain occasion the monks met in the Dhamma Hall and praised the wisdom of SÄriputta, the Captain of the Dhamma, who had expounded the meaning of the One with Ten Powersâ pithy saying. Entering the hall, the Teacher asked and was told what the monks were talking about. âThis is not the first time, monks,â said he, âthat the meaning of a pithy saying of mine has been brought out by SÄriputta. He did the like in times gone by.â So saying, he told this story of the past.

Of those who gathered, more than a hundred who were unwise might think a hundred years, but one person with wisdom is better, one who knows the meaning of what is said.

## Full Story
âThe one who should shelter me from suffering.â
 
[1.244]
 
{1.411}
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a lay brother who was a greengrocer in SÄvatthi and made a living by the sale of various roots and vegetables, and pumpkins and the like. Now he had a pretty daughter who was as good and virtuous as she was pretty, but was always laughing. And when she was asked in marriage by a family of his own station in life, he thought: âShe ought to be married, but sheâs always laughing; and a bad girl married into a strange family is her parentsâ shame. I must find out for certain whether she is a good girl or not.â


So one day he made his daughter take a basket and come with him to the forest to gather herbs. Then to try her, he took her by the hand with whispered words of love. Straightaway the girl burst into tears and began to cry out that such a thing would be as monstrous as fire rising out of water, and she besought him to forbear. Then he told her that his only intent was to try her, and asked whether she was virtuous. And she declared that she was and that she had never looked on any man with eyes of love. Calming her fears and taking her back home, he made a feast and gave her in marriage. Then feeling that he ought to go and pay his respects to the Teacher, he took perfumes and garlands in his hand and went to Jetavana. His salutations done and offerings made, he seated himself near the Teacher, who observed that it was a long time since his last coming. Then the man told the Fortunate One the whole story.


âShe has always been a good girl,â said the Teacher. âYou have put her to the test now just as you did in days gone by.â Then at the greengrocerâs request he told this story of the past.

The one who should shelter me from suffering, my father, is treacherous inside the woods, to whom will I cry out amidst the woods? He who protects me, offers violence.

His story ended, the Teacher preached the Four Truths, at the close whereof the greengrocer was established in the First Path. Then the Teacher identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThe father and daughter of today were the father and daughter in the story, and I the Tree DevatÄ who witnessed the scene.â

{1.413}
 and got safely into SÄvatthi. Next day he went to the monastery and told the Teacher what had befallen him. âSir,â said the Teacher, âin other times too the wise and good espied robbers on the road and hastened without delay to their homes.â Then at the merchantâs request he told this story of the past.

Wherever an enemy resides, there the wise one does not reside, he who for one or two nights dwells amongst enemies has suffering.

His story ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka by saying: âI was the merchant of Benares of those days.â

 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a monk who lived in a perpetual state of nervous alarm. We learn that he came of a good family in SÄvatthi, and was led to give up the world by hearing the Dhamma preached, and that he was always in fear of his life 
[1.247]
 both by night and by day. The sound of the wind, the rustle of a fan, or the cry of bird or beast would inspire him with such abject terror that he would shriek and dash away. He never reflected that death was sure to come upon him; though, had he practised meditation on the certainty of death, he would not have feared it. 
{1.415}
 For only they that do not so meditate fear death.


Now his constant fear of dying became known to the monks, and one day they met in the Dhamma Hall and fell to discussing his fearfulness and the propriety of every monkâs taking death as a theme for meditation. Entering the Hall, the Teacher asked, and was told, what they were discussing. So he sent for that monk and asked him whether it was true he lived in fear of death. The monk confessed that he did. âBe not angry, monks,â said the Teacher, âwith this monk. The fear of death that fills his breast, now was no less strong in bygone times.â So saying he told this story of the past.

Although the wind breaks off many of the weak branches in this wood, if you are fearful about it, elephant, you will waste away. 
{1.416}

His lesson ended, the Teacher taught the Four Truths, at the close whereof the monk entered the Paths, and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThis monk was the elephant of those days and I the Tree DevatÄ.â

âI was surely living happily.â
 
[1.248]
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a temptation by a sensual girl. The incident will be related in the CullanÄradakassapajÄtaka [Ja 477] 
[The relevant portion is included here.]
 in the Thirteenth Book.

There was then, we learn, a girl of about sixteen, daughter of a citizen of SÄvatthi, such as might bring good luck to a man, yet no man chose her. So her mother thought to herself, âThis my daughter is of full age, yet no one chooses her. I will use her as bait for a fish, and make one of those SÄkiyan ascetics come back to the world, and live upon him.â At the time there was a young man of good birth living in SÄvatthi, who had given his heart to the dispensation and went forth. But from the time when he had received full ordination he had lost all desire for learning, and lived devoted to the adornment of his person.


The lay sister used to prepare in her house rice gruel, and other food hard or soft, and standing at the door, as the monks walked along the streets, looked out for someone who could be tempted by the craving for delicacies. Streaming by went a crowd of monks who upheld the Three Baskets, including the Abhidhamma and the Vinaya; but among them she saw none ready to rise to her bait. Among the figures with bowl and robe, preachers of the Dhamma with honey-sweet voice, moving like fleecy scud before the wind, she saw not one.


But at last she perceived a man approaching, the outer corners of his eyes anointed, hair hanging down, wearing an under-robe of fine cloth, and an outer robe shaken and cleansed, bearing a bowl coloured like some precious gem, and a sunshade after his own heart, a man who let his senses have their own way, his body much bronzed. âHere is a man I can catch!â thought she; and greeting him, she took his bowl, and invited him into the house. She found him a seat, and provided rice gruel and all the rest; then after the meal, begged him to make that house his resort in future. So he used to visit the house after that, and in course of time became intimate.


One day, the lay sister said in his hearing, âIn this household we are happy enough, only I have no son or son-in-law capable of keeping it up.â The man heard it, and wondering what reason she could have for so saying, in a little while he was as it were pierced to the heart. She said to her daughter, âTempt this man, and get him into your power.â So the girl after that time decked herself and adorned herself, and tempted him with all womenâs tricks and wiles. Then the man, being young and under the power of passion, thought in his heart, âI cannot now hold on to the Buddhaâs dispensation,â and he went to the monastery, and laying down bowl and robe, said to his spiritual teachers, âI am discontented.â


Then they conducted him to the Teacher, and said: âSir, this monk is discontented.â

On asking the monk, the Teacher was told that it was true he was in love, and in love with the sensual girl. âMonk,â said the Teacher, âshe is leading you astray. So too in times gone by she led you into evil, and you were only restored to happiness by the wise and good of those days.â So saying, he told this story of the past.

I was surely living happily, torturing me with a bucket that thief, supposedly my wife, entreated me for both oil and salt.

His lesson ended, and the Four Truths preached, at the close whereof that monk entered the First Path, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThe sensual girl of today was also the sensual girl of those days; this yoking monk was the son; and I the father of those days.â

## Full Story
âHaving what is known as a craft is good.â
 
{1.418}
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a monk who threw and hit a swan. We are told that this monk, who came of a good family in SÄvatthi, had acquired great skill in hitting things with stones; and that hearing the Dhamma preached one day he gave his heart to the dispensation and went forth. But neither in study nor practice did he excel as a monk.


One day, with a youthful monk, he went to the river AciravatÄ«, 
The modern RÄpti, in Oudh.
 and was standing on the bank after bathing, when he saw two white swans flying by. Said he to the younger monk, âIâll hit the following swan in the eye and bring it down.â âBring it down indeed!â said the other, âyou canât hit it.â âJust you wait a moment. Iâll hit it on the eye this side through the eye on the other.â âOh, nonsense.â âVery well; you wait and see.â Then he took a three-cornered stone in his hand and flung it after the swan. âWhizâ went the stone through the air and the swan, suspecting danger, stopped to listen. At once the monk seized a smooth round stone and as the resting swan was looking in another direction hit it full in the eye, so that the stone went in at one eye and came out at the other. And with a loud scream the swan fell to the ground at their feet.


âThat is a highly improper action,â said the other monk, and brought him before the Teacher, with an account of what had happened. After rebuking the monk, the Teacher said: âThe same skill was his, monks, in past times as now.â And he told this story of the past.

Having what is known as a craft is good, whatever kind is found, see the disabled man give blows â he got villages in four directions!

His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThis monk was the handicapped man of those days, Änanda the king, and I the wise courtier.â

Now his wife was a very fat woman, almost bloated in appearance, and she was badly dressed.


Thanking the king for his hospitality, the Teacher returned to the monastery and, after a discourse to the monks, retired to his perfumed chamber.


Assembled in the Dhamma Hall, the monks expressed their surprise that a man like this Licchavi prince should have such a fat, badly-dressed woman for his wife, and be so fond of her. Entering the Hall and hearing what they were discussing, the Teacher said: âMonks, as now, so in former times he was fond of a fat woman.â Then, at their request, he told this story of the past.

âJust as the manâs food.â
 This story was told by the Teacher when at SÄvatthi, about a very poor man.


Now at SÄvatthi the Saá¹gha with the Buddha at their head used to be entertained now by a single family, now by three or four families together. Or a body of people or a whole street would club together, or sometimes the whole city entertained them. But on the occasion now in question it was a street that was offering the hospitality. And the inhabitants had arranged to provide rice-gruel followed by cakes.


Now in that street there lived a very poor man, a hired labourer, who could not see how he could give the gruel, but resolved to give cakes. And he scraped out the red powder from empty husks and kneaded it with water into a round cake. This cake he wrapped in a leaf of swallow-wort, and baked it in the embers. When it was done, he made up his mind that none but the Buddha should have it, and accordingly took his stand immediately by the Teacher. No sooner had the word been given to offer cakes, than he stepped forward quicker than anyone else and put his cake in the Teacherâs alms-bowl. And the Teacher declined all other cakes offered him and ate the poor manâs cake. Forthwith the whole city talked of nothing but how the Fully Awakened One had not disdained to eat the poor manâs bran-cake. And from porters to nobles and king, all classes flocked to the spot, saluted the Teacher, and crowded round the poor man, 
[1.253]
 offering him food, or two to five hundred pieces of money if he would make over to them the merit of his act.


Thinking he had better ask the Teacher first, he went to him and stated his case. âTake what they offer,â said the Teacher, âand impute your righteousness to all living creatures.â So the man set to work to collect the offerings. Some gave twice as much as others, some four times as much, others eight times as much, and so on, till nine crores of gold were contributed.


Returning thanks for the hospitality, the Teacher went back to the monastery and after instructing the monks and imparting his standard teaching to them, retired to his perfumed chamber.


In the evening the king sent for the poor man, and created him Lord Treasurer.


Assembling in the Dhamma Hall the monks spoke together of how the Teacher, not disdaining the poor manâs bran-cake, had eaten it as though it were ambrosia, and how the poor man had been enriched 
{1.423}
 and made Lord Treasurer to his great good fortune. And when the Teacher entered the Hall and heard what they were talking of, he said: âMonks, this is not the first time that I have not disdained to eat that poor manâs cake of bran. I did the same when I was a Tree DevatÄ, and then too was the means of his being made Lord Treasurer.â So saying he told this story of the past.

Just as the manâs food, so is the DevatÄâs food, you must bring me rice-cake, do not destroy my share.

His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThe poor man of today was also the poor man of those times, and I the Tree DevatÄ who dwelt in the castor-oil tree.â

## Full Story
âThoughtful and Thoughtless.â
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about two aged elders. After a rainy-season spent in a forest in the country they resolved to seek out the Teacher, and got together provisions for their journey. But they kept putting off their departure day by day, till a month flew by. Then they provided a fresh supply of provisions, and procrastinated till a second month was gone, and a third. When their indolence and sluggishness had lost them three months, they set out and came to Jetavana. Laying aside their bowls and robes in the common-room, they came into the Teacherâs presence. The monks remarked on the length of the time since the two had visited the Teacher, and asked the reason. Then 
{1.427}
 they told their story and all the Saá¹gha came to know of the laziness of these indolent monks.


Assembling in the Dhamma Hall the monks talked together of this thing. And the Teacher entered and was told what they were discussing. Being asked whether they were really so indolent, those monks admitted their short-coming. âMonks,â said he, âin former times, no less than now, they were indolent and reluctant to leave their abode.â So saying, he told this story of the past.

His story told, the Teacher, after Fully Awakening, recited this verse: 
{1.428}

Thoughtful and Thoughtless, both are caught up in the net, Measured Thought frees them, both of them assemble there.

His lesson ended, and the Four Truths expounded, at the close whereof the aged monks gained fruition of the First Path, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThese two monks were then Over-thoughtful and Thoughtless, and I Thoughtful.â

## Full Story
âShe who gave advice to others.â
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a nun who gave a warning to others. For we are told that she came of a good SÄvatthi family, but that from the day of her entrance into the Saá¹gha she failed of her duty and was filled with a gluttonous spirit; she used to seek alms in quarters of the city unvisited by other nuns. And dainty food was given her there. Now her gluttony made her afraid that other nuns might go there too and take away from her part of the food. Casting about for a device to stop them from going and to keep everything to herself, she warned 
[1.258]
 the other nuns that it was a dangerous quarter, troubled by a fierce elephant, a fierce horse, and a fierce dog. And she besought them not to go there for alms. Accordingly not a single nun gave so much as a look in that direction.


Now one day on her way through this district for alms, as she was hurrying into a house there, a fierce ram butted her with such violence as to break her leg. Up ran the people and set her leg and brought her on a litter to the convent of nuns. And all the nuns tauntingly said her broken leg came of her going where she had warned them not to go.


Not long after the Saá¹gha came to hear of this; and one day in the Dhamma Hall 
{1.429}
 the monks spoke of how this nun had got her leg broken by a fierce ram in a quarter of the city against which she had warned the other nuns; and they condemned her conduct. Entering the Hall at this moment, the Teacher asked, and was told, what they were discussing. âAs now, monks,â said he, âso too in a past time she gave warnings which she did not follow herself; and then as now she came to harm.â So saying, he told this story of the past.

She who gave advice to others, lived in a greedy way herself, staying there SÄsikÄ, with her wings destroyed, was killed by the wheel. 
{1.430}

His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThe warning nun was the bird AnusÄsikÄ of those times, and I the king of the birds.â

 [1.259]
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about an unruly monk whose own story will be given in the Ninth Book in the GijjhajÄtaka [Ja 427].

This story the Teacher told at Jetavana concerning a disobedient monk. He was, they say, of gentle birth, and though ordained in the dispensation that leads to safety, was admonished by his well-wishers, masters, teachers, and fellow-students to this effect, âThus must you advance and thus retreat; thus look at or away from objects; thus must the arm be stretched out or drawn back; thus are the inner and outer garment to be worn; thus is the bowl to be held, and when you have received sufficient food to sustain life, after self-examination, thus are you to partake of it, keeping guard over the door of the senses; in eating you are to be moderate and exercise watchfulness; you are to recognize such and such duties towards monks who come to or go from the monastery; these are the fourteen sets of monastic duties, and the eighty great duties to be duly performed; these are the thirteen ascetic practices; all these are to be scrupulously performed.â Yet was he disobedient and impatient, and did not receive instruction respectfully, but refused to listen to them, saying: âI do not find fault with you. Why do you speak thus to me? I shall know what is for my good, and what is not.â


Then the monks, hearing of his disobedience, sat in the Dhamma Hall, telling of his faults. The Teacher came and asked them what it was they were discussing, and sent for the monk and said: âIs it true, monk, that you are disobedient?â And he confessed that it was so.

The Teacher rebuked him in these words, âAs now, so in former days were you unruly, monk, disregarding the counsels of the wise and good. Wherefore, by a javelin you did die.â So saying, he told this story of the past.

Having done much too much, teacher, such as was against my liking, jumping over four javelins, on the fifth one you were impaled.

His story done, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThis unruly monk was the master of those days, and I the pupil.â

## Full Story
âTalking excessively, and much too strongly.â
 
 [1.260]
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about KokÄlika, whose story will be found in the Thirteenth Book in the TakkÄriyajÄtaka [Ja 481]. 
KokÄlika was one of Devadattaâs schismatics. [I include the story here.]

During one rainy season the two chief disciples, desiring to leave the multitude and to dwell apart, took leave of the Teacher, and went into the kingdom where KokÄlika was. They repaired to the residence of KokÄlika, and said this to him, âMonk KokÄlika, since for us it is delightful to dwell with you, and for you to dwell with us, we would abide here three months.â âHow,â said the other, âwill it be delightful for you to dwell with me?â They answered, âIf you tell not a soul that the two chief disciples are dwelling here, we shall be happy, and that will be our delight in dwelling with you.â âAnd how is it delightful for me to dwell with you?â âWe will teach the Dhamma to you for three months in your home, and we will discourse to you, and that will be your delight in dwelling with us.â âDwell here, monks,â said he, âso long as you will,â and he allotted a pleasant residence to them. There they dwelt in the fruition of the Attainments, and no man knew of their dwelling in that place.


When they had thus past the rains they said to him, âMonk, now we have dwelt with you, and we will go to visit the Teacher,â and asked his leave to go. He agreed, and went with them on the rounds for alms in a village over against the place where they were. After their meal the elders departed from the village. KokÄlika leaving them, turned back and said to the people, âLay brethren, you are like brute animals. Here the two chief disciples have been dwelling for three months in the monastery opposite, and you knew nothing of it: now they are gone.â âWhy did you not tell us, sir?â the people asked.


Then they took ghee and oil and medicines, raiment and clothes, and approached the elders, saluting them and saying: âPardon us, sirs we knew not you were the chief disciples, we have learned it but today by the words of the venerable monk KokÄlika. Pray have compassion on us, and receive these medicines and clothes.â KokÄlika went after the elders with them, for he thought: âThe elders are frugal, and content with little; they will not accept these things, and then they will be given to me.â But the elders, because the gift was offered at the instigation of a monk, neither accepted the things themselves nor had them given to KokÄlika. The lay folk then said: âSirs, if you will not accept these, come here once again to bless us.â The elders promised, and proceeded to the Teacherâs presence.


Now KokÄlika was angry, because the elders neither accepted those things themselves, nor had them given to him. The elders, however, having remained a short while with the Teacher, each chose five hundred monks as their following, and with these thousand monks went on pilgrimage seeking alms, as far as KokÄlikaâs country. The lay folk came out to meet them, and led them to the same monastery, and showed them great honour day by day.


Great was the store given them of clothes and of medicines. Those monks who went out with the elders dividing the garments gave of them to all the monks which had come, but to KokÄlika gave none, neither did the elders give him any. Getting no clothes KokÄlika began to abuse and revile the elders, âSÄriputta and MoggallÄna are full of wicked desire; they would not accept before what was offered them, but these things they do accept. There is no satisfying them, they have no regard for another.â But the elders, perceiving that the man was harbouring evil on their account, set out with their followers to depart; nor would they return, not though the people begged them to stay yet a few days longer.


Then a young monk said: âWhere shall the elders stay, laymen? Your own particular elder does not wish them to stay here.â Then the people went to KokÄlika, and said: âSir, we are told you do not wish the elders to stay here. Go to! Either appease them and bring them back, or away with you and live elsewhere!â In fear of the people this man went and made his request to the elders. âGo back, monk,â answered the elders, âwe will not return.â So he, being unable to prevail upon them, returned to the monastery. Then the lay brethren asked him whether the elders had returned. âI could not persuade them to return,â said he. âWhy not, monk?â they asked. And then they began to think it must be no good monks would dwell there because the man lived wrong, and they must get rid of him. âSir,â they said, âdo not stay here; we have nothing here for you.â


Thus dishonoured by them, he took bowl and robe and went to Jetavana. After saluting the Teacher, he said: âSir, SÄriputta and MoggallÄna are full of wicked desire, they are in the power of wicked desires!â The Teacher replied, âSay not so, KokÄlika; let your heart, KokÄlika, have confidence in SÄriputta and MoggallÄna; learn that they are good monks.â KokÄlika said: âYou believe in your two chief disciples, sir; I have seen it with my own eyes; they have wicked desires, they have secrets within them, they are wicked men.â So he said thrice (though the Teacher would have stayed him), then rose from his seat, and departed. Even as he went on his way there arose over all his body boils of the size of a mustard seed, which grew and grew to the size of a ripe seed of the wood apple tree, burst, and blood ran all over him. Groaning he fell by the gate of Jetavana, maddened with pain.


A great cry arose, and reached even to the Brahma Realm, âKokÄlika has reviled the two chief disciples!â Then his spiritual teacher, the Brahma Tudu by name, learning the fact, came with the intent of appeasing the elders, and said while poised in the air, âKokÄlika, a cruel thing this you have done; make your peace with the chief disciples.â âWho are you, brother?â the man asked. âTudu Brahma, is my name,â said he. âHave you not been declared by the Fortunate One,â said the man, âone of those who return not? That word means that such come not back to this earth. You will become a Yakkha upon a dunghill!â Thus he upbraided the MahÄbrahma. And as he could not persuade the man to do as he advised, he replied to him, âMay you be tormented according to your own word.â Then he returned to his abode of bliss. And KokÄlika after dying was born again in the Lotus Hell. That he had been born there the great and mighty Brahma told to the TathÄgata, and the Teacher told it to the monks.


In the Dhamma Hall the monks talked of the manâs wickedness, âMonks, they say KokÄlika reviled SÄriputta and MoggallÄna, and by the words of his own mouth came to the Lotus Hell.â The Teacher came in, and said he, âWhat speak you of, monks, as you sit here?â They told him.

Said the Teacher, âAs now, monks, so likewise in former times, KokÄlikaâs tongue has worked his destruction.â


So saying, he told this story of the past.

Talking excessively, and much too strongly, and for much too long, by words the unintelligent was killed, like the noisy partridge.

Said the Teacher, âMonks, as now, so likewise in former days KokÄlikaâs tongue has worked his destruction.â And at the close of this lesson he identified the JÄtaka by saying: âKokÄlika was the meddling ascetic of those days, my followers the band of ascetics, and I their master.â

## Full Story
âThe unthinking person.â
 This story the Teacher told while at Jetavana, about the son of Uttaraseá¹­á¹­hi [Greater Treasurer]. This Uttaraseá¹­á¹­hi is said to have been a very rich man of SÄvatthi, and his wife became the mother of a righteous being from the realm of Brahma angels, who grew up as lovely as Brahma. 
{1.433}
 Now one day when the KattikÄ [Autumn] festival had been proclaimed in SÄvatthi, the whole city gave itself up to the festivities. His companions, sons of other rich men, had all got wives, but Uttaraseá¹­á¹­hiâs son had lived so long in the Brahma Realm that he was purged from passion. His companions plotted together to get him too a sweetheart and make him keep the feast with them. So going to him they said: âDear friend, it is the great feast of KattikÄ. Canât we get a sweetheart for you too, and have a good time together?â At last his friends picked out a charming girl and decked her out, and left her at his house, with directions to make her way to his chamber. But when she entered the room, not a look or a word did she get from the young merchant. Piqued at this slight to her beauty, she put forth all her graces and feminine blandishments, smiling meantime so as just to show her pretty teeth. The sight of her teeth suggested bones, and his mind was filled with the idea of bones, till the girlâs whole body seemed to him nothing but a chain of bones. Then he gave her money and bade her begone. But as she came out of the house a nobleman saw her in the street and gave her a present to accompany him home.


At the end of seven days the festival was over, and the girlâs mother, seeing her daughter did not come back, went to the young merchantâs friends and asked where she was, and they in turn asked the young merchant. And he said he had paid her and sent her packing as soon as he saw her.


Then the girlâs mother insisted on having her daughter restored to her, and brought the young man before the king, who proceeded to examine into the matter. In answer to the kingâs questions, the young man admitted that the girl had been passed on to him, but said he had no knowledge of her whereabouts, and no means of producing her. Then said the king, âIf he fails to produce the girl, execute him.â So the young man was forthwith hauled off with his hands tied behind his back to be executed, and the whole city was in an uproar at the news. With hands laid on their breasts the people followed after him with lamentations, saying: âWhat means this, sir? You suffer unjustly.â


Then thought the young man 
{1.434}
 âAll this sorrow has befallen me because I was living a lay life. If I can only escape this danger, I will give up the world and join the Saá¹gha of the great Gotama, the Fully Awakened One.â


Now the girl herself heard the uproar and asked what it meant. Being told, she ran swiftly out, crying, âStand aside, sirs! Let me pass! Let the kingâs men see me.â As soon as she had thus shown herself, she was handed over to her mother by the kingâs men, who set the young man free and went their way.
 [1.262]


Surrounded by his friends, the son of Uttaraseá¹­á¹­hi went down to the river and bathed. Returning home, he breakfasted and let his parents know his resolve to give up the world. Then taking cloth for his asceticâs robe, and followed by a great crowd, he sought out the Teacher and with due salutation asked to be admitted to the Saá¹gha. A novice first, and afterwards a full monk, he meditated on the idea of Bondage till he gained Insight, and not long afterwards became an Arahat.


Now one day in the Dhamma Hall the assembled monks talked of his virtues, recalling how in the hour of danger he had recognized the excellence of the dispensation, and, wisely resolving to give up the world for its sake, had won that highest fruit which is Arahatship. And as they talked, the Teacher entered, and, on his asking, was told what was the subject of their conversation. Whereon he declared to them that, like the son of Uttaraseá¹­á¹­hi, the wise of former times, by taking thought in the hour of peril, had escaped death. So saying, he told this story of the past.

The unthinking person does not attain a distinction, but look at the fruit of the thoughtful one: I am free from bondage and death.

His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka by saying: âI was the quail that escaped death in those days.â

âNo mother and father raised him.â
 
 [1.263]
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a monk who used to be noisy at the wrong time. He is said to have come of a good SÄvatthi family and to have given up the world for the dispensation, but to have neglected his duties and despised instruction. He never took count of the hours for duties, for ministry or for reciting the texts. Throughout the three watches of the night, as well as the hours of waking, he was never quiet; so that the other monks could not get a wink of sleep.


Accordingly, the monks in the Dhamma Hall censured his conduct. Entering the Hall and learning on enquiry what they were talking about, the Teacher said: âMonks, as now, so in past times, this monk was noisy out of season, and for his unseasonable conduct was strangled.â So saying he told this story of the past. 
{1.436}

No mother and father raised him, not under a teacherâs influence, neither at the right or wrong time, did the cock know when to call out.
[1.264]

His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka as follows, âThis monk was the cock of those times, who did not know when not to crow; my disciples were the young brahmins; and I their teacher.â

## Full Story
âThey bind the unbound right there.â
 
{1.437}
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about the brahmin-girl CiÃ±cÄ, whose history will be given in the Twelfth Book in the MahÄpadumajÄtaka [Ja 472].

When the One with Ten Powers first attained supreme wisdom, after disciples had multiplied, and innumerable gods and men had been born into heavenly states, and the seeds of goodness had been cast abroad, great honour was shown him, and great gifts given. The heretics were like fireflies after sunrise; they had no honours and no gifts; in the street they stood, and cried out to the people, âWhat is the ascetic Gotama the Buddha? We are Buddhas also! Does that gift only bring great fruit, which is given to him? That which is given to us also has great fruit for you! Give to us also, work for us!â But cry as they would, they got no honour nor gifts. Then they came together in secret, and consulted, âHow can we cast a stain upon Gotama the ascetic in the face of men, and put an end to his honour and his gifts?â


Now there was at that time in SÄvatthi a certain nun, named CiÃ±camÄá¹avikÄ; she was very lovely, full of all grace, like a DevaccharÄ; rays of brilliancy shone forth from her body. Some one uttered a counsel of cruelty thus, âBy the help of CiÃ±camÄá¹avikÄ we will cast a stain upon the ascetic Gotama, and put an end to his honour and the gifts he receives.â âYes,â they all agreed, âthat is the way to do it.â


She came to the monastery of the heretics, and greeted them, and stood still. The heretics said nothing to her. She said: âWhat blemish is there in me? Three times I have greeted you!â She said again, âSirs, what blemish is in me? why do you not speak to me?â They replied, âKnow you not, sister, that Gotama the ascetic is going about and doing us harm, cutting off all the honour and liberality that was shown us?â âI did not know it, sirs; but what can I do?â âIf you wish us well, sister by your own doing bring a stain upon the ascetic Gotama, and put an end to his honour and the gifts he receives.â She replied, âVery good, sirs, leave that to me; do not trouble about it.â With these words she departed.


After that, she used all a womanâs skill in deceit. When the people of SÄvatthi had heard the Dhamma, and were coming away from Jetavana, she used to go towards Jetavana, clad in a robe dyed with cochineal, and with fragrant garlands in her hands. When any one asked her, âWhither away at this hour?â she would reply, âWhat have you to do with my goings and comings?â She spent the night in the hereticsâ monastery, which was close by Jetavana: and when early in the morning, the lay associates of the order came forth from the city to pay their morning salutation, she would meet them as though she had spent the night in Jetavana, going towards the city. If any one asked where she had stayed, she would answer, âWhat are my stayings and lodgings to you?â But after some six weeks, she replied, âI spent the night in Jetavana, with Gotama the ascetic, in one fragrant cell.â Then the unconverted began to wonder, could this be true, or not.


After three or four months, she bound bandages about her belly, and made it appear as though she were with child, and wrapped a red robe around her. Then she declared that she was with child by the ascetic Gotama, and made blind fools believe. After eight or nine months, she fastened about her pieces of wood in a bundle, and over all her red robe; hands, feet, and back she caused to be beaten with the jawbone of an ox, so as to produce swellings; and made as though all her senses were wearied.


One evening, when the TathÄgata was sitting on the splendid seat of preaching, and was preaching the Dhamma, she went among the Saá¹gha, and standing in front of the TathÄgata, said: âO great ascetic! You preach indeed to great multitudes; sweet is your voice, and soft is the lip that covers your teeth; but you have got me with child, and my time is near; yet you assign me no chamber for the childbirth, you give me no ghee nor oil; what you will not do yourself, you do not ask another of the lay associates to do, the king of Kosala, or AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika, or VisÄkhÄ the great lay sister. Why do you not tell one of them to do what is to be done for me? You know how to take your pleasure, but you do not know how to care for that which shall be born!â So she reviled the TathÄgata in the midst of the Saá¹gha, as one might try to besmirch the moonâs face with a handful of filth. The TathÄgata stopped his discourse, and roaring like a lion in clarion tones, he said: âSister, whether that which you have said be true or false, you know and I only know.â âYes, truly,â said she, âthis happened through something that you and I only know of.â


Just at that moment, Sakkaâs throne became hot. Reflecting, he perceived the reason, âCiÃ±camÄá¹avikÄ is accusing the TathÄgata of what is not true.â Determined to clear up this matter, he came there with four Devaputtas in his company. The Devaputtas took on them the shape of mice, and all at once gnawed through the cords that bound the bundle of wood: a wind-puff blew up the robe she wore, and the bundle of wood was disclosed and fell at her feet: the toes of both her feet were cut off. The people cried out, âA wretch is accusing the Supreme Buddha!â They spat on her head, and drove her forth from Jetavana with staves and clods in their hands. And as she passed beyond the range of the TathÄgataâs vision, the great earth yawned and showed a huge cleft, flames came up from the lowest hell, and she, enveloped in it as it were with a garment which her friends should wrap about her, fell to the lowest hell and there was born again. The honour and receipts of the other heretics ceased, those of the One with Ten Powers grew more abundantly.


Next day they were conversing in the Dhamma Hall, âMonks, CiÃ±camÄá¹avikÄ falsely accused the Supreme Buddha, great in virtue, worthy of all gifts! And she came to dire destruction.â The Teacher entered, and asked what they talked of, sitting there together. They told him.

On this occasion the Teacher said: âMonks, this is not the first time CiÃ±cÄ has laid false accusations against me. She did the like in other times.â So saying he told this story of the past.

They bind the unbound right there, where fools speak, they free the bound right there, where the wise speak. 
[1.267]

His teaching ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka by saying: âCiÃ±cÄ was the wicked queen of those days, Änanda the king, and I his family priest.â

## Full Story
âThe one the same.â
 
{1.441}
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about AnÄthapiá¹á¸ikaâs true friend. For his acquaintances and friends and relations came to him and tried hard to stop his intimacy with a certain man, saying that neither in birth nor wealth was he AnÄthapiá¹á¸ikaâs equal. But the great merchant replied that friendship should not depend on equality or inequality of externals. And when he went off to his village headmany, he put this friend in charge of his wealth. Everything came to pass as in the KÄlakaá¹á¹ijÄtaka [Ja 83].

Tradition says that the two had made mud-pies together, and had gone to the same school; but, as years went by, the friend, whose name was Wretch [KÄá¸·akaá¹á¹Ä«], sank into great distress and could not make a living anyhow. So he came to the rich man, who was kind to him, and paid him to look after all his property; and the poor friend was employed under AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika and did all his business for him. After he had gone up to the rich manâs it was a common thing to hear in the house, âStand up, Wretch,â or, âSit down, Wretch,â or, âHave your dinner, Wretch.â


One day the Treasurerâs friends and acquaintances called on him and said: âLord Treasurer, donât let this sort of thing go on in your house. Itâs enough to scare a Yakkha to hear such ill-omened observations as â âStand up, Wretch,â or âSit down, Wretch,â or âHave your dinner, Wretch.â The man is not your social equal; heâs a miserable wretch, dogged by misfortune. Why have anything to do with him?â âNot so,â replied AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika, âa name only serves to denote a man, and the wise do not measure a man by his name; nor is it proper to wax superstitious about mere sounds. Never will I throw over, for his mere nameâs sake, the friend with whom I made mud-pies as a child.â And he rejected their advice.


One day the great man departed to visit a village of which he was headman, leaving the other in charge of the house. Hearing of his departure certain robbers made up their mind to break into the house; and, arming themselves to the teeth, they surrounded it in the night-time. But Wretch had a suspicion that burglars might be expected, and was sitting up for them. And when he knew that they had come, he ran about as if to rouse his people, bidding one sound the conch, another beat the drum, till he had the whole house full of noise, as though be were rousing a whole army of servants. Said the robbers, âThe house is not so empty as we were told; the master must be at home.â Flinging away their stones, clubs and other weapons, away they bolted for their lives.


Next day great alarm was caused by the sight of all the discarded weapons lying round the house; and Wretch was lauded to the skies by such praises as this, âIf the house had not been patrolled by one so wise as this man, the robbers would have simply walked in at their own pleasure and have plundered the house. The Treasurer owes this stroke of good luck to his staunch friend.â And the moment the merchant came back from his village they hastened to tell him the whole story. âAh,â said he, âthis is the trusty guardian of my house whom you wanted me to get rid of. If I had taken your advice and got rid of him; I should be a beggar today. Itâs not the name but the heart within that makes the man.â So saying he raised his wages. And thinking that here was a good story to tell, off he went to the Teacher and gave him a complete account of it all, right through.

But, when in this case AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika related the danger his house had been in, the Teacher said: âLayman, a friend rightly so-called is never inferior. The standard is ability to befriend. A friend rightly so-called, though only equal or inferior to oneâs self, should be held a superior, for all such friends fail not to grapple with trouble which befalls oneâs self. It is your real friend that has now saved you your wealth. So in days gone by a like real friend saved a DevatÄâs mansion.â Then at AnÄthapiá¹á¸ikaâs request, he told this story of the past.

The one the same, and then the one greater, and the one lower, let him make a friend, they should give utmost help to unfortunates, like I, KusanÄá¸·i, did to this tree. 
[1.269]

His lesson ended the Teacher identified the birth by saying: âÄnanda was then the Tree DevatÄ, and I the Kusa DevatÄ.â

 maddened Devadatta; and how in his jealousy he could not bear to hear the praises of the Buddhaâs utter wisdom. Entering the Hall, the Teacher asked what was the subject of their conversation. And when they told him, he said: âMonks, as now, so in former times Devadatta was maddened by hearing my praises.â So saying, he told this story of the past.

When a foolish one receives fame, itâs not at all for his welfare, he practices in a way harmful for himself and for others.

âThe fool in all cases speaks a word.â
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about the elder LÄá¸·udÄyi who is said to have had a knack of always saying the wrong thing. He never knew the proper occasion for the several teachings. For instance, if it was a festival, he would croak out the gloomy text, 
[Khp 7

 âWithout the walls they lurk, and where four cross-roads meet.â If it was a funeral, he would burst out with,

 âJoy filled the hearts of gods and men,â or with, 
[These lines seem to appear only here, so it is presumably a lost sutta.]
 âOh may you see 
{1.447}
 a hundred, nay a thousand such glad days!â


Now one day the monks in the Dhamma Hall commented on his singular infelicity of subject and his knack of always saying the wrong thing. As they sat talking, the Teacher entered, and, in answer to his question, was told the subject of their talk. âMonks,â said he, âthis is not the first time that LÄá¸·udÄyiâs folly has made him say the wrong thing. He has always been as inept as now.â So saying he told this story of the past.

Blameless in his attendance on teachers; scrupulous in the matter of foods and drinks; zealous in the performance of the duties of the chapter-house, bath-house, and so forth; perfectly punctual in the observance of the fourteen major and of the eighty minor disciplines; he used to sweep the monastery, the cells, the cloisters, and the path leading to their monastery, and gave water to thirsty folk. And because of his great goodness folk gave regularly five hundred meals a day to the monks; and great gain and honour accrued to the monastery, the many prospering for the virtues of one. And one day in the Dhamma Hall the monks fell to talking of how that monkâs goodness had brought them gain and honour, and filled many lives with joy. Entering the Hall, 
{1.450}
 the Teacher asked, and 
[1.274]
 was told, what their talk was about. âThis is not the first time, monks,â said he, âthat this monk has been regular in the fulfilment of duties. In days gone by five hundred ascetics going out to gather fruits were supported on the fruits that his goodness provided.â So saying, he told this story of the past.

[1.275]
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a boastful monk. The introductory story about him is like what has already been related [Ja 80].

This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a certain braggart among the monks. Tradition says that he used to gather round him monks of all ages, and go about deluding everyone with lying boasts about his noble descent. âAh, monks,â he would say, âthereâs no family so noble as mine, no lineage so peerless. I am a scion of the highest of princely lines; no man is my equal in birth or ancestral estate; there is absolutely no end to the gold and silver and other treasures we possess. Our very slaves and menials are fed on rice and meat-stews, and are clad in the best Benares cloth, with the choicest Benares perfumes to perfume themselves withal; while I, because I have joined the Saá¹gha, have to content myself with this vile fare and this vile garb.â But another monk, after enquiring into his family estate, exposed to the monks the emptiness of this pretension.


So the monks met in the Dhamma Hall, and talk began as to how that monk, in spite of his vows to leave worldly things and cleave only to the dispensation which leads to safety, was going about deluding the monks with his lying boasts. While the fellowâs sinfulness was being discussed, the Teacher entered and enquired what their topic was. And they told him. âThis is not the first time, monks,â said the Teacher, âthat he has gone about boasting; in bygone days too he went about boasting and deluding people.â And so saying, he told this story of the past.

Should he, having gone to another country, boast excessively, returning back he would spoil it: enjoy your wealth Kaá¹­Ähaka.

His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThis bumptious monk was the Kaá¹­Ähaka of those days, and I the Treasurer of Benares.â

## Full Story
âIn the same way that which is good for one.â
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a brahmin retained by the king of Kosala because of his power of telling whether swords were lucky or not. We are told that when the kingâs smiths had forged a sword, this brahmin could by merely smelling it tell whether it was 
[1.278]
 a lucky one or not. And he made it a rule only to commend the work of those smiths who gave him presents, while he rejected the work of those who did not bribe him.


Now a certain smith made a sword and put into the sheath with it some finely-ground pepper, and brought it in this state to the king, who at once handed it over to the brahmin to test. The brahmin unsheathed the blade and sniffed at it. The pepper got up his nose and made him sneeze, and that so violently that he slit his nose on the edge of the sword.


This mishap of the brahmin came to the monkâs ears, and one day they were talking about it in the Dhamma Hall when the Teacher entered. On learning the subject of their talk, he said: âThis is not the first time, monks, that this brahmin has slit his nose sniffing swords. The same fate befell him in former days.â So saying, he told this story of the past.

In the same way that which is good for one, is bad for another, so nothing is completely good, and nothing is completely bad.

In this wise did the Teacher teach the lesson that the world was wrong in thinking things were definitely and absolutely good or bad in all cases alike. Lastly, he identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThe same man that now professes to understand whether swords are lucky or not, professed the same skill in those days; and I was myself the prince who inherited his uncleâs kingdom.â

âMy poor wife doesnât seem to get any better of the wind,â thought the brahmin at last, and betook himself with offerings of perfumes, flowers, and the like, to the Teacher at Jetavana. His obeisance done, he stood before the Fortunate One, who asked him why he had been absent so long.


âSir,â said the brahmin, âIâm told my wife is troubled with the wind, and I toil away to keep her supplied with every conceivable dainty. And now she is stout and her complexion quite clear, but the wind is as troublesome as ever. It is through ministering to my wife that I have not had any time to come here, sir.â


Said the Teacher, who knew the wifeâs wickedness, âAh! Brahmin, the wise and good of days gone by taught you how to treat a woman suffering like your wife from so stubborn an ailment. But rebirth has confused your memory so that you forget.â So saying, he told the following story of the past.

Accordingly, you can enjoy your words, and you can speak of food, however, you cannot have both the words and the food, KosiyÄ. 
{1.465}

His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThe husband and wife of today were the husband and wife of the story, and I was the master.â

âBecause of not sharing with anyone.â
 
 [1.286]
 This story was told by the Teacher while at the Bamboo Grove, about Devadatta. For at that time the monks were discussing in the Dhamma Hall the ingratitude of Devadatta and his inability to recognise the Teacherâs goodness, when the Teacher himself entered and on enquiry was told the subject of their talk. âMonks,â said he, âthis is not the first time that Devadatta has been ungrateful to the TathÄgata; he was just as ungrateful in bygone days.â So saying, he told this story of the past. 
{1.466}

Because of not sharing with anyone, to a fool, friends are a source of distress, 
{1.468}
 so I accept his half-measure of chaff, do not let me be deprived of his friendship forever.

His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka by saying: âDevadatta was the Treasurer Piliya of those days, and I myself Saá¹kha.â

## Full Story
âSkilful advice, with firm resolution.â
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana about the Sutta concerning the Temptation by the Daughters of MÄra 
[The 
Palobhanasutta
 = SN 4.25, otherwise known as 
MÄradhÄ«tusutta
.]
 at the Goatherdsâ Banyan tree. The Teacher quoted the Sutta, beginning with its opening words:

âIn all their dazzling beauty on they came,

Craving and Hate and Lust. Like cotton-down

Before the wind, the Teacher made them fly.â 
[1.289]

After he had recited the Sutta right through to the end, the monks met together in the Dhamma Hall and spoke of how the Daughters of MÄra drew near in all their myriad charms yet failed to seduce the Fully Awakened One. For he did not as much as open his eyes to look upon them, so marvellous was he! Entering the hall, the Teacher asked, and was told, what they were discussing. âMonks,â said he, âit is no marvel that I did not so much as look upon the Daughters of MÄra in this life when I have put wrong from me and have won Awakening. In former days when I was but in quest of Awakening, when wronging still dwelt within me, I found strength not to gaze even upon loveliness divine by way of lust in violation of virtue; and by that continence I won a kingdom.â So saying, he told this story of the past.

Skilful advice, with firm resolution, without turning back through fear and through fright, we came not under Rakkhasisâ control, I found a state of safety from great fear. 
{1.471}

His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka by saying: âI was the prince of those days who went to Taxila and won a kingdom.â

In the present one monk goes for meditation, but when his hut burns down he is unable to make progress. He stays on in the village anyway. When he comes to the Buddha after the Rains Retreat, the latter tells him a story of how in a past life he had acted quickly to save his subjects when a NÄga had attacked them with fire.


The Bodhisatta = the king of the birds (sakuá¹arÄjÄ),

## Full Story
âWhere there is safety.â
 
 [1.290]
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a certain monk who was given by the Teacher a subject for meditation, and, going to the borders, took up his abode in the forest near a hamlet. Here he hoped to pass the rainy season, but during the very first month his hut was burnt down while he was in the village seeking alms. Feeling the loss of its sheltering roof, he told his lay friends of his misfortune, and they readily undertook to build him another hut. But, in spite of their protestations, three months slipped away without its being rebuilt. Having no roof to shelter him, the monk had no success in his meditation. Not even the mental image had been vouchsafed to him when at the close of the rainy season he went back to Jetavana and stood respectfully before the Teacher. In the course of talk the Teacher asked whether the monkâs meditation had been successful. Then that monk related from the beginning the good and ill that had befallen him. Said the Teacher, âIn days gone by, even brute beasts could discern between what was good and what bad for them and so quit betimes, ere they proved dangerous, the habitations that had sheltered them in happier days. And if beasts were so discerning, how could you fall so far short of them in wisdom?â So saying, at that monkâs request, the Teacher told this story of the past.

Where there is safety there are foes, is said, fire burns in the middle of the water. Not living today in this tree on earth, go away, there is danger from our refuge today. 
[1.291]

His lesson ended, the Teacher preached the Four Truths, at the close whereof that monk became an Arahat, and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThe loyal and obedient birds of those days are now become my disciples, and I myself was then the king of the birds.â

## Full Story
âThose who are conscious.â
 
{1.473}
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about the interpretation by SÄriputta, Captain of the Dhamma, at the gate of Saá¹kassa town, of a problem tersely propounded by the Teacher. 
[The story is related in the Dhp-a XIV.2. I include the relevant part of the story here, slightly modified from Burlingameâs translation.]

At that time the Teacher put a question concisely to that elder. This is the full story, put briefly, of the descent from the world of gods. When the venerable Piá¹á¸ola BhÄradvÄja had by his Supernormal Powers gained the sandalwood bowl in the presence of the great merchant of RÄjagaha, the Teacher forbade the monks to use their miraculous Supernormal Powers.


Then the schismatics thought: âThe ascetic Gotama has forbidden the use of miraculous Supernormal Powers: now he will do no miracle himself.â Their disciples were disturbed, and said to the schismatics, âWhy didnât you take the bowl by your Supernormal Powers?â They replied, âThis is no hard thing for us, friend. But we think, âWho will display before the laity his own fine and subtle powers for the sake of a paltry wooden bowl?â and so we did not take it. The ascetics of the Sakya class took it, and showed their Supernormal Powers for sheer foolish greed. Do not imagine it is any trouble to us to work miracles. Suppose we leave out of consideration the disciples of Gotama the ascetic: if we like, we too will show our Supernormal Powers with the ascetic Gotama himself: if the ascetic Gotama works one miracle, we will work one twice as good.â


The monks who heard this told the Fortunate One of it, âSir, the schismatics say they will work a miracle.â Said the Teacher, âLet them do it, monks; I will do the like.â BimbisÄra, hearing this, went and asked the Fortunate One, âWill you work a miracle, sir?â âYes, O king.â âWas there not a command given on this matter, sir?â âThe command, O king, was given to my disciples; there is no command which can rule the Buddhas. When the flowers and fruit in your park are forbidden to others, the same rule does not apply to you.â âThen where will you work this miracle, sir?â âAt SÄvatthi, under Gaá¹á¸aâs mango tree.â âWhat have I to do, then?â âNothing, sire.â


Next day, after breaking his fast, the Teacher went to seek alms. âWhither goes the Teacher?â asked the people. The monks answered to them, âAt the gate of the city of SÄvatthi, beneath Gaá¹á¸aâs mango tree, he is to work a twofold miracle to the confounding of the schismatics.â The crowd said: âThis miracle will be what they call a masterpiece; we will go see it,â leaving the doors of their houses, they went along with the Teacher. Some of the schismatics also followed the Teacher, with their disciples, âWe too,â they said, âwill work a miracle, in the place where the ascetic Gotama shall work his.â


By and by the Teacher arrived at SÄvatthi. The king asked him, âIs it true, sir, you are about to work a miracle, as they say?â âYes, it is true,â he said. âWhen?â asked the king. âOn the seventh day from now, at the full moon of the month of July.â âShall I set up a pavilion, sir?â âPeace, great king: in the place where I shall work my miracle Sakka will set up a pavilion of jewels twelve leagues in compass.â âShall I proclaim this thing through the city, sir?â âProclaim it, O king.â The king sent forth the announcer of the Dhamma on an elephant richly caparisoned, to proclaim thus, âNews! The Teacher is about to perform a miracle, for the confounding of the schismatics, at the Gate of SÄvatthi, under Gaá¹á¸aâs mango tree, seven days from now!â Each day was this proclamation made. When the schismatics heard this news, that the miracle will be done under Gaá¹á¸aâs mango tree, they had all the mango trees near to SÄvatthi cut down, paying the owners for them.


On the night of the full moon the announcer of the Dhamma made proclamation, âThis day in the morning the miracle will take place.â By the power of the gods it was as though all JambudÄ«pa was at the door and heard the proclamation; whosoever had it in his heart to go, they all betook themselves to SÄvatthi: for twelve leagues the crowd extended.


Early in the morning the Teacher went on his rounds seeking alms. The kingâs gardener, Gaá¹á¸a by name, was just taking to the king a fine ripe mango fruit; thoroughly ripe, big as a bushel, when he espied the Teacher at the city gate. âThis fruit is worthy of the TathÄgata,â said he, and gave it to him. The Teacher took it, and sitting down then and there on one side, ate the fruit. When it was eaten, he said: âÄnanda, give the gardener this stone to plant here on the spot; this shall be Gaá¹á¸aâs mango tree.â The elder did so.


The gardener dug a hole in the earth, and planted it. On the instant the stone burst, roots sprouted forth, up sprang a red shoot tall as a plough-pole; even as the crowd stared it grew into a mango tree of a hundred cubits, with a trunk fifty cubits and branches of fifty cubits in height; at the same time flowers bloomed, fruit ripened; the tree stood filling the sky, covered with bees, laden with golden fruit; when the wind blew on it, sweet fruits fell; then the monks came up and ate of the fruit, and retired.


In the evening time the King of the Devas, reflecting, perceived that it was a task laid on him to make a pavilion of the seven precious things. So he sent the Devaputta Vissakamma, and caused him to make a pavilion of the seven precious things, twelve leagues in compass, covered all over with blue lotus. Thus the gods of ten thousand spheres were gathered together. The Teacher, for the confounding of the schismatics having performed a twofold miracle passing marvellous among his disciples, caused faith to spring up in multitudes, then arose and, sitting in the Buddhaâs seat, declared the Dhamma. Twenty crores of beings drank of the waters of life. Then, meditating to see whither it was that former Buddhas went when they had done a miracle, and perceiving that it was to the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, up he rose from the Buddhaâs seat, the right foot he placed on the top of Mount Yugandhara, and with his left strode to the peak of Sineru, he began the Rains Retreat under the great Coral Tree, seated upon the yellow-stone throne; for the space of three months he discoursed upon the Abhidhamma to the gods.


The people knew not the place whither the Teacher had gone; they looked, and said: âLet us go home,â and lived in that place during the rainy season. When the rainy season was near to its end, and the feast was at hand, the great elder MoggallÄna went and announced it to the Fortunate One. Thereupon the Teacher asked him, âWhere is SÄriputta now?â âHe, sir, after the miracle which delighted him, remained with five hundred monks in the city of Saá¹kassa, and is there still.â âMoggallÄna, on the seventh day from now I shall descend by the gate of Saá¹kassa. Let those who desire to behold the TathÄgata assemble in the city of Saá¹kassa.â The elder assented, went and told the people: the whole company he transported from SÄvatthi to Saá¹kassa, a distance of thirty leagues, in the twinkling of an eye.


The Rains Retreat over, and the Invitation celebrated, the Teacher told king Sakka that he was about to return to the world of men. Then Sakka sent for Vissakamma, and said to him, âMake a stairway for the One with Ten Powers to descend into the world of men.â He placed the head of the stairway upon the peak of Sineru, and the foot of it by the gate of Saá¹kassa, and between he made three stairways side by side: one of gems, one of silver, and one of gold: the balustrade and cornice were of the seven things of price. The Teacher, having performed a miracle for the worldâs emancipation, descended by the midmost stair made out of gems. Sakka carried the bowl and robe, SuyÄma a yakâs-tail fan, Brahma Lord of all beings bore a sunshade, and the deities of the ten thousand spheres worshipped with divine garlands and perfumes. When the Teacher stood at the foot of the staircase, first elder SÄriputta gave him greeting, afterwards the rest of the company.


Amidst this assembly the Teacher thought: âMoggallÄna has been shown to possess supernatural power, UpÄli as one who is versed in the sacred law, but the quality of high wisdom possessed by SÄriputta has not been shown. Save and except me, no other possesses wisdom so full and complete as his; I will make known the quality of his wisdom.â First of all he asked a question which is put to ordinary persons, and the ordinary persons answered it. Then he asked a question within the scope of those of the First Path, and this they of the First Path answered, but the ordinary folk knew nought of it. In the same way he asked questions in turn within the scope of those of the Second and Third Paths, of the Arahats, of the chief disciples; and in each case those who were below each grade in turn were unable to answer, but they who were above could answer. Then he put a question within the power of SÄriputta, and this the elder could answer, but the others not so. The people asked, âWho is this elder who answered the Teacher?â They were told, it was the Captain of the Dhamma, and SÄriputta was his name. âAh, great is his wisdom!â they said. Ever afterwards the quality of the elderâs great wisdom was known to men and to gods. Then the Teacher said to him,

âSome have probations yet to pass, and some have reached the goal:

Their different behaviours say, for you do know the whole.â

Having thus asked a question which comes within a Buddhaâs scope, he added, âHere is a point put with brevity, SÄriputta; what is the meaning of the matter in all its bearings?â The elder considered the problem. He thought: âThe Teacher asks of the proper behaviour with which the monks attain progress, both those who are in the lower Paths and those who are Arahats?â As to the general question, he had no doubt. But then he considered, âThe proper manner of behaviour may be described in many ways of speaking according to the essential elements of being, and so forth from that beginning; now in what fashion can I hit the Teacherâs meaning?â He was doubtful about the meaning. The Teacher thought: âSÄriputta has no doubt of the general question, but doubts what particular side of it I have in view. If I give no clue, he will never be able to answer, so a clue I will give him.â This clue he gave by saying: âSee here, SÄriputta: you grant this to be true?â (mentioning some point). SÄriputta granted the point.


The hint thus given, he knew that SÄriputta had taken his meaning, and would answer fully, starting from the very elements of being. Then the question stood out clear before the elder, as with a hundred hints, nay, a thousand; and he, at the Teacherâs hint given, answered the question which belonged to a Buddhaâs scope.

And the following was the story of the past he then told.

Those who are conscious fare badly, those unconscious fare badly too, you should abandon both of these, bliss of attainment is spotless.

His lesson taught, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka by saying: âIn those days SÄriputta was the chief disciple, and I MahÄbrahma.â

At that time the Teacher put a question concisely to that elder. This is the full story, put briefly, of the descent from the world of gods. When the venerable Piá¹á¸ola BhÄradvÄja had by his Supernormal Powers gained the sandalwood bowl in the presence of the great merchant of RÄjagaha, the Teacher forbade the monks to use their miraculous Supernormal Powers.


Then the schismatics thought: âThe ascetic Gotama has forbidden the use of miraculous Supernormal Powers: now he will do no miracle himself.â Their disciples were disturbed, and said to the schismatics, âWhy didnât you take the bowl by your Supernormal Powers?â They replied, âThis is no hard thing for us, friend. But we think, âWho will display before the laity his own fine and subtle powers for the sake of a paltry wooden bowl?â and so we did not take it. The ascetics of the Sakya class took it, and showed their Supernormal Powers for sheer foolish greed. Do not imagine it is any trouble to us to work miracles. Suppose we leave out of consideration the disciples of Gotama the ascetic: if we like, we too will show our Supernormal Powers with the ascetic Gotama himself: if the ascetic Gotama works one miracle, we will work one twice as good.â


The monks who heard this told the Fortunate One of it, âSir, the schismatics say they will work a miracle.â Said the Teacher, âLet them do it, monks; I will do the like.â BimbisÄra, hearing this, went and asked the Fortunate One, âWill you work a miracle, sir?â âYes, O king.â âWas there not a command given on this matter, sir?â âThe command, O king, was given to my disciples; there is no command which can rule the Buddhas. When the flowers and fruit in your park are forbidden to others, the same rule does not apply to you.â âThen where will you work this miracle, sir?â âAt SÄvatthi, under Gaá¹á¸aâs mango tree.â âWhat have I to do, then?â âNothing, sire.â


Next day, after breaking his fast, the Teacher went to seek alms. âWhither goes the Teacher?â asked the people. The monks answered to them, âAt the gate of the city of SÄvatthi, beneath Gaá¹á¸aâs mango tree, he is to work a twofold miracle to the confounding of the schismatics.â The crowd said: âThis miracle will be what they call a masterpiece; we will go see it,â leaving the doors of their houses, they went along with the Teacher. Some of the schismatics also followed the Teacher, with their disciples, âWe too,â they said, âwill work a miracle, in the place where the ascetic Gotama shall work his.â


By and by the Teacher arrived at SÄvatthi. The king asked him, âIs it true, sir, you are about to work a miracle, as they say?â âYes, it is true,â he said. âWhen?â asked the king. âOn the seventh day from now, at the full moon of the month of July.â âShall I set up a pavilion, sir?â âPeace, great king: in the place where I shall work my miracle Sakka will set up a pavilion of jewels twelve leagues in compass.â âShall I proclaim this thing through the city, sir?â âProclaim it, O king.â The king sent forth the announcer of the Dhamma on an elephant richly caparisoned, to proclaim thus, âNews! The Teacher is about to perform a miracle, for the confounding of the schismatics, at the Gate of SÄvatthi, under Gaá¹á¸aâs mango tree, seven days from now!â Each day was this proclamation made. When the schismatics heard this news, that the miracle will be done under Gaá¹á¸aâs mango tree, they had all the mango trees near to SÄvatthi cut down, paying the owners for them.


On the night of the full moon the announcer of the Dhamma made proclamation, âThis day in the morning the miracle will take place.â By the power of the gods it was as though all JambudÄ«pa was at the door and heard the proclamation; whosoever had it in his heart to go, they all betook themselves to SÄvatthi: for twelve leagues the crowd extended.


Early in the morning the Teacher went on his rounds seeking alms. The kingâs gardener, Gaá¹á¸a by name, was just taking to the king a fine ripe mango fruit; thoroughly ripe, big as a bushel, when he espied the Teacher at the city gate. âThis fruit is worthy of the TathÄgata,â said he, and gave it to him. The Teacher took it, and sitting down then and there on one side, ate the fruit. When it was eaten, he said: âÄnanda, give the gardener this stone to plant here on the spot; this shall be Gaá¹á¸aâs mango tree.â The elder did so.


The gardener dug a hole in the earth, and planted it. On the instant the stone burst, roots sprouted forth, up sprang a red shoot tall as a plough-pole; even as the crowd stared it grew into a mango tree of a hundred cubits, with a trunk fifty cubits and branches of fifty cubits in height; at the same time flowers bloomed, fruit ripened; the tree stood filling the sky, covered with bees, laden with golden fruit; when the wind blew on it, sweet fruits fell; then the monks came up and ate of the fruit, and retired.


In the evening time the King of the Devas, reflecting, perceived that it was a task laid on him to make a pavilion of the seven precious things. So he sent the Devaputta Vissakamma, and caused him to make a pavilion of the seven precious things, twelve leagues in compass, covered all over with blue lotus. Thus the gods of ten thousand spheres were gathered together.

The people knew not the place whither the Teacher had gone; they looked, and said: âLet us go home,â and lived in that place during the rainy season. When the rainy season was near to its end, and the feast was at hand, the great elder MoggallÄna went and announced it to the Fortunate One. Thereupon the Teacher asked him, âWhere is SÄriputta now?â âHe, sir, after the miracle which delighted him, remained with five hundred monks in the city of Saá¹kassa, and is there still.â âMoggallÄna, on the seventh day from now I shall descend by the gate of Saá¹kassa. Let those who desire to behold the TathÄgata assemble in the city of Saá¹kassa.â The elder assented, went and told the people: the whole company he transported from SÄvatthi to Saá¹kassa, a distance of thirty leagues, in the twinkling of an eye.


The Rains Retreat over, and the Invitation celebrated, the Teacher told king Sakka that he was about to return to the world of men. Then Sakka sent for Vissakamma, and said to him, âMake a stairway for the One with Ten Powers to descend into the world of men.â He placed the head of the stairway upon the peak of Sineru, and the foot of it by the gate of Saá¹kassa, and between he made three stairways side by side: one of gems, one of silver, and one of gold: the balustrade and cornice were of the seven things of price. The Teacher, having performed a miracle for the worldâs emancipation, descended by the midmost stair made out of gems. Sakka carried the bowl and robe, SuyÄma a yakâs-tail fan, Brahma Lord of all beings bore a sunshade, and the deities of the ten thousand spheres worshipped with divine garlands and perfumes. When the Teacher stood at the foot of the staircase, first elder SÄriputta gave him greeting, afterwards the rest of the company.


Amidst this assembly the Teacher thought: âMoggallÄna has been shown to possess supernatural power, UpÄli as one who is versed in the sacred law, but the quality of high wisdom possessed by SÄriputta has not been shown. Save and except me, no other possesses wisdom so full and complete as his; I will make known the quality of his wisdom.â First of all he asked a question which is put to ordinary persons, and the ordinary persons answered it. Then he asked a question within the scope of those of the First Path, and this they of the First Path answered, but the ordinary folk knew nought of it. In the same way he asked questions in turn within the scope of those of the Second and Third Paths, of the Arahats, of the chief disciples; and in each case those who were below each grade in turn were unable to answer, but they who were above could answer. Then he put a question within the power of SÄriputta, and this the elder could answer, but the others not so. The people asked, âWho is this elder who answered the Teacher?â They were told, it was the Captain of the Dhamma, and SÄriputta was his name. âAh, great is his wisdom!â they said. Ever afterwards the quality of the elderâs great wisdom was known to men and to gods. Then the Teacher said to him,

âSome have probations yet to pass, and some have reached the goal:

Their different behaviours say, for you do know the whole.â

Having thus asked a question which comes within a Buddhaâs scope, he added, âHere is a point put with brevity, SÄriputta; what is the meaning of the matter in all its bearings?â The elder considered the problem. He thought: âThe Teacher asks of the proper behaviour with which the monks attain progress, both those who are in the lower Paths and those who are Arahats?â As to the general question, he had no doubt. But then he considered, âThe proper manner of behaviour may be described in many ways of speaking according to the essential elements of being, and so forth from that beginning; now in what fashion can I hit the Teacherâs meaning?â He was doubtful about the meaning. The Teacher thought: âSÄriputta has no doubt of the general question, but doubts what particular side of it I have in view. If I give no clue, he will never be able to answer, so a clue I will give him.â This clue he gave by saying: âSee here, SÄriputta: you grant this to be true?â (mentioning some point). SÄriputta granted the point.


The hint thus given, he knew that SÄriputta had taken his meaning, and would answer fully, starting from the very elements of being. Then the question stood out clear before the elder, as with a hundred hints, nay, a thousand; and he, at the Teacherâs hint given, answered the question which belonged to a Buddhaâs scope.

He who, with wisdom, is well grounded in the moonâs or sunâs lustre, through absorption, without thinking, will go to the Radiant Realm.

His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka by saying: âSÄriputta was the chief disciple of those days, and I MahÄbrahma.â

## Full Story
âYou should be content with what is received.â
 This story was told by the Teacher about a nun named ThullanandÄ.


A lay brother at SÄvatthi had offered the nuns a supply of garlic, and, sending for his bailiff; had given orders that, if they should come, each nun was to receive two or three handfuls. After that they made a practice 
{1.475}
 of coming 
[1.293]
 to his house or field for their garlic. Now one holiday the supply of garlic in the house ran out, and the nun ThullanandÄ, coming with others to the house, was told, when she said she wanted some garlic, that there was none left in the house, it had all been used up out of hand, and that she must go to the field for it. So away to the field she went and carried off an excessive amount of garlic. The bailiff grew angry and remarked what a greedy lot these nuns were! This piqued the more moderate nuns; and the monks too were piqued at the taunt when the nuns repeated it to them, and they told the Fortunate One. Rebuking the greed of ThullanandÄ, the Teacher said: âMonks, a greedy person is harsh and unkind even to the mother who bore him; a greedy person cannot convert the unconverted, or make the converted grow in grace, or cause alms to come in, or save them when come in; whereas the moderate person can do all these things.â In such wise did the Teacher point the moral, ending by saying: âMonks, as ThullanandÄ is greedy now, so she was greedy in times gone by.â And thereupon he told the following story of the past.

At the close of this story the Teacher said: âThus you see, monks, how ThullanandÄ was as greedy in times past as she is now. And her greed then lost her the gold in the same way as her greed now will lose her the garlic. Observe, moreover, how her greed has deprived all the nuns of their supply of garlic, and learn therefrom to be moderate in your desires and to be content with what is given you, however small that may be.â So saying, he uttered this verse:

You should be content with what is received, the wicked have great greed, after grabbing ahold of the king of geese, the gold must decline.

So saying, the Teacher soundly rebuked the erring nun and laid down the precept that any nun who should eat garlic would have to do penance. Then, 
{1.477}
 making the connection, he said: âThullanandÄ was the brahminâs wife of the story, her three sisters were the brahminâs three daughters, and I myself the golden mallard.â

## Full Story
âWhere one cat receives.â
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about the precept respecting KÄá¹Äâs mother. She was a lay-sister at SÄvatthi known only as KÄá¹Äâs mother, who had entered the Paths of emancipation and was of the disciples. Her daughter KÄá¹Ä 
The name 
KÄá¹Ä
 means âone-eyedâ.
 was married to a husband of the same caste in another village, and some errand or other made her go to see her mother. A few days went by, and her husband sent a messenger to say he wished her to come back. The girl asked her mother whether she should go, and the mother said she could not go back empty-handed after so long an absence, and set about making a cake. Just then up came a monk going his round for alms, and the mother sat him down to the cake she had just baked. Away he went 
[1.295]
 and told another monk, who came up just in time to get the second cake that was baked for the daughter to take home with her. He told a third, and the third told a fourth, and so each fresh cake was taken by a fresh comer.


The result of this was that the daughter did not start on her way home, and the husband sent a second and a third messenger after her. And the message he sent by the third was that if his wife did not come back, he should get another wife. And each message had exactly the same result. So the husband took another wife, and at the news his former wife fell weeping. Knowing all this, the Teacher put on his robes early in the morning and went with his alms-bowl to the house of KÄá¹Äâs mother and sat down on the seat set for him. Then he asked why the daughter was crying, and, being told, spoke words of consolation to the mother, and arose and went back to the monastery.


Now the monks came to know how KÄá¹Ä had been stopped three times from going back to her husband owing to the action of the four monks; and one day they met in the Dhamma Hall and began to talk about the matter. The Teacher came into the Hall 
{1.478}
 and asked what they were discussing, and they told him. âMonks,â said he, âthink not this is the first time those four monks have brought sorrow on KÄá¹Äâs mother by eating of her store; they did the like in days gone by too.â So saying he told this story of the past.

Where one cat receives, a second appears right there, a third and a fourth, this is the catâs crystal cave.

His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThese four monks were the four cats of those days, KÄá¹Äâs mother was the mouse, and I the stone-cutter.â

We hear that the monks, meeting together in the Dhamma Hall, spoke one with another, saying that even as a torch from a pyre, charred at both ends and bedunged in the middle, does not serve as wood either in forest tree or village-hearth, so Devadatta by giving up the world to follow this dispensation which leads to safety had only achieved a twofold shortcoming and failure, seeing that he had missed the comforts of a lay life yet had fallen short of his vocation as a monk.


Entering the Hall, the Teacher asked and was told what the monks were talking of together. âYes, monks,â said he, âand so too in days gone by Devadatta came to just such another two-fold failure.â So saying, he told this story of the past.

Eyes are blinded, and clothes are lost, accusations in a friendâs house, both of their doings are wicked, in the water and on dry land.

## Full Story
âAlways frantic in heart.â
 
 [1.300]
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a sagacious counsellor. The incidents will be related in the twelfth book in connection with the BhaddasÄlajÄtaka [Ja 465].

Now at this time there lived close to the gate a Licchavi named MahÄli, who had been educated by the same teacher as the king of Kosalaâs general, Bandhula. This man was blind, and used to advise the Licchavis on all matters temporal and spiritual. Hearing the clatter of the chariot as it went over the threshold, he said: âThe noise of the chariot of Bandhula the Mallian! This day there will be fear for the Licchavis!â By the tank there was set a strong guard, within and without; above it was spread an iron net; not even a bird could find room to get through. But the general, dismounting from his carriage, put the guards to flight with the blows of his sword, and burst through the iron network, and in the tank bathed his wife and gave her to drink of the water; then after bathing himself, he set MallikÄ in the chariot, and left the town, and went back by the way he came.


The guards went and told all to the Licchavis. Then were the kings of the Licchavis angry; and five hundred of them, mounted in five hundred chariots, departed to capture Bandhula the Mallian. They informed MahÄli of it, and he said: âGo not! For he will slay you all.â But they said: âNay, but we will go.â âThen if you come to a place where a wheel has sunk up to the nave, you must return. If you return not then, return back from that place when you hear the noise of a thunderbolt. If then you turn not, turn back from that place where you shall see a hole in front of your chariots. Go no further!â But they did not turn back according to his word, but pursued on and on.


MallikÄ espied them and said: âThere are chariots in sight, my lord.â âThen tell me,â said he, âwhen they all look like one chariot.â When they all in a line looked like one, she said: âMy lord, I see as it were the head of one chariot.â âTake the reins, then,â said he, and gave the reins into her hand: he stood upright in the chariot, and strung his bow. The chariot-wheel sank into the earth nave-deep. The Licchavis came to the place, and saw it, but turned not back. The other went on a little further, and twanged the bow string; then came a noise as the noise of a thunderbolt, yet even then they turned not, but pursued on and on. Bandhula stood up in the chariot and sped a shaft, and it cleft the heads of all the five hundred chariots, and passed right through the five hundred kings in the place where the girdle is fastened, and then buried itself in the earth. As they did not perceive that they were wounded they pursued still, shouting, âStop, holloa, stop!â Bandhula stopped his chariot, and said: âYou are dead men, and I cannot fight with the dead.â âWhat!â they said, âdead, such as we now are?â âLoose the girdle of the first man,â said Bandhula.


They loosed his girdle, and at the instant the girdle was loosed, he fell dead. Then he said to them, âYou are all of you in the same condition: go to your homes, and set in order what should be ordered, and give your directions to your wives and families, and then doff your armour.â They did so, and then all of them gave up the ghost.


And Bandhula conveyed MallikÄ to SÄvatthi. She bore twin sons sixteen times in succession, and they were all mighty men and heroes, and became perfected in all manner of accomplishments. Each one of them had a thousand men to attend him, and when they went with their father to wait on the king, they alone filled the courtyard of the palace to overflowing.


One day some men who had been defeated in court on a false charge, seeing Bandhula approach, raised a great outcry, and informed him that the judges of the court had supported a false charge. So Bandhula went into the court, and judged the case, and gave each man his own. The crowd uttered loud shouts of applause. The king asked what it meant, and on hearing was much pleased; all those officers he sent away, and gave Bandhula charge of the judgement court, and thenceforward he judged aright. Then the former judges became poor, because they no longer received bribes, and they slandered Bandhula in the kingâs ear, accusing him of aiming at the kingdom himself. The king listened to their words, and could not control his suspicions. âBut,â he reflected, âif he be slain here, I shall be blamed.â He instigated certain men to harry the frontier districts; then sending for Bandhula, he said: âThe borders are in a blaze; go with your sons and capture the brigands.â With him he also sent other men sufficient, mighty men of war, with instructions to kill him and his two-and-thirty sons, and cut off their heads, and bring them back.


While he was yet on the way, the hired brigands got wind of the generalâs coming, and took to flight. He settled the people of that district in their homes, and quieted the province, and set out for home. Then when he was not far from the city, those warriors cut off his head and the heads of his sons.

Always frantic in heart, troubled by the whole world, therefore they have no fat, our relatives the crows.

His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka by saying: âÄnanda was king of Benares in those days, and I myself the king of the crows.â

## Full Story
âAssociating with the wicked.â
 
 {1.487}
 This story was told by the Teacher while at the Bamboo Grove, about a traitorous monk. The introductory incident is the same as that told in the MahilÄmukhajÄtaka [Ja 26].

This story was told by the Teacher while at the Bamboo Grove, about Devadatta, who, having secured the adherence of prince AjÄtasattu, had attained both gain and honour. Prince AjÄtasattu had a monastery built for Devadatta at GayÄsÄ«sa, and every day brought to him five hundred pots of perfumed three-year-old rice flavoured with all the choicest flavourings. All this gain and honour brought Devadatta a great following, with whom Devadatta lived on, without ever stirring out of his monastery.


At that time there were living in RÄjagaha two friends, of whom one had taken the vows under the Teacher, while the other had taken them under Devadatta. And these continued to see one another, either casually or by visiting the monasteries. Now one day the disciple of Devadatta said to the other, âSir, why do you daily go round for alms with the sweat streaming off you? Devadatta sits quietly at GayÄsÄ«sa and feeds on the best of fare, flavoured with all the choicest flavourings. Thereâs no way like his. Why create misery for yourself? Why should it not be a good thing for you to come the first thing in the morning to the monastery at GayÄsÄ«sa and there drink our rice-gruel with a relish after it, try our eighteen kinds of solid victuals, and enjoy our excellent soft food, flavoured with all the choicest flavourings?â


Being pressed time after time to accept the invitation, the other began to want to go, and thenceforth used to go to GayÄsÄ«sa and there eat and eat, not forgetting however to return to the Bamboo Grove at the proper hour. Nevertheless he could not keep it secret always; and in a little while it came out that he used to go to GayÄsÄ«sa and there regale himself with the food provided for Devadatta. Accordingly, his friends asked him, saying: âIs it true, as they say, that you regale yourself on the food provided for Devadatta?â âWho said that?â said he. âSo-and-so said it.â âIt is true, sirs, that I go to GayÄsÄ«sa and eat there. But it is not Devadatta who gives me food; others do that.â âSir, Devadatta is the foe of the Buddhas; in his wickedness, he has secured the adherence of AjÄtasattu and by unrighteousness got gain and honour for himself. Yet you who have taken the vows according to this dispensation which leads to safety, eat the food which Devadatta gets by unrighteousness. Come; let us bring you before the Teacher.â And, taking with them the monk, they went to the Dhamma Hall.


When the Teacher became aware of their presence, he said: âMonks, are you bringing this monk here against his will?â âYes, sir; this monk, after taking the vows under you, eats the food which Devadatta gets by unrighteousness.â âIs it true, as they say, that you eat the food which Devadatta gets by unrighteousness?â âIt was not Devadatta, sir, that gave it me, but others.â âRaise no quibbles here, monk,â said the Teacher. âDevadatta is a man of bad conduct and bad principle. Oh, how could you, who have taken the vows in the Buddhaâs dispensation, eat Devadattaâs food, while living in the Teacherâs presence? But you have always been prone to being led away, and have followed in turn every one you meet.â And, so saying, he told this story of the past.

Associating with the wicked doesnât bring endless happiness, like the chameleons  who brought the iguana clan disaster. 
{1.489}

His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka by saying: âDevadatta was the chameleon of those days; this traitorous monk was the disobedient young iguana, the son of the Bodhisatta; and I myself the king of the iguanas.â

## Full Story
âYour brains are split open.â
 This story was told by the Teacher while at the Bamboo Grove, about Devadattaâs efforts to pose as a Buddha at GayÄsÄ«sa. For when Absorption left him and he lost the honour and profit which once were his, he in his perplexity asked the Teacher to concede the Five Points. This being refused, he made a schism in the Saá¹gha and departed to GayÄsÄ«sa with five hundred young monks, pupils of the Buddhaâs two chief disciples, but as yet unversed in the Dhamma and the Regulations. With this following he performed the acts of a separate Saá¹gha gathered together within the same precincts. Knowing well the time when the knowledge of these young monks should ripen, the Teacher sent the two elders to them. Seeing these, 
{1.491}
 Devadatta joyfully set to work expounding far into the night with (as he flattered himself) the masterly power of a Buddha. Then posing as a Buddha he said: âThe assembly, venerable SÄriputta, is still alert and sleepless. Will you be so good as to think of some Dhamma discourse to address to the monks? My back is aching with my labours, and I must rest it awhile.â So saying he went away to lie down. Then those two chief disciples taught the monks, enlightening them as to the Fruitions and the Paths, till in the end they won them all over to go back to the Bamboo Grove.


Finding the monastery emptied of the monks, KokÄlika went to Devadatta and told him how the two disciples had broken up his following and left the monastery empty, âand yet here you still lie asleep,â said he. So saying he stripped off Devadattaâs outer cloth and kicked him on the chest with as little compunction as if he were knocking a roof-peg into a mud-wall. The blood gushed out of Devadattaâs mouth, and ever after he suffered from the effects of the blow. 
The 
Vinaya
 account (
Cullavagga
 vii. 4) omits the kicking, simply stating that KokÄlika âawokeâ Devadatta, and that, at the news of the defection, âwarm blood gushed out of Devadattaâs mouth.â 
 [1.306]


The Teacher said to SÄriputta, âWhat was Devadatta doing when you got there?â And SÄriputta answered that, though posing as a Buddha, evil had befallen him. Said the Teacher, âEven as now, SÄriputta, so in former times too has Devadatta imitated me to his own hurt.â Then, at the elderâs request, he told this story of the past.

Your brains are split open, and your head is smashed in, all your ribs are broken, today you did shine forth.

His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka by saying: âDevadatta was the jackal of those days, and I the lion.â

 their various false austerities â were moved to ask the Fortunate One whether any good resulted therefrom. âNone whatsoever,â answered the Teacher. âIn days gone by, the wise and good went into the forest with their birth-fire, thinking to profit by such austerities; but, finding themselves no better for all their sacrifices to Fire and for all similar practices, straightaway doused the birth-fire with water till it went out.

## Full Story
âYou do not know, RÄdha.â 
This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about hankering after the wife of oneâs mundane life. The incidents of the introductory story will be told in the IndriyajÄtaka [Ja 423].

The Teacher told this tale while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning temptation by the wife of oneâs former days. The story is that a young man of good family at SÄvatthi heard the Teacherâs preaching, and thinking it impossible to lead a holy life, perfectly complete and pure, as a householder, he determined to become an ascetic in the dispensation which leads to safety and so make an end of misery. So he gave up his house and property to his wife and children, and asked the Teacher to ordain him. The Teacher did so. As he was the junior in his going about for alms with his teachers and instructors, and as the monks were many, he got no chair either in laymenâs houses or in the refectory, but only a stool or a bench at the end of the novices, his food was tossed him hastily on a ladle, he got gruel made of broken lumps of rice, solid food stale or decaying, or sprouts dried and burnt; and this was not enough to keep him alive. He took what he had got to the wife he had left: she took his bowl, saluted him, emptied it and gave him instead well-cooked gruel and rice with sauce and curry.


The monk was captivated by the love of such flavours and could not leave his wife. She thought she would test his affection. One day she had a countryman cleansed with white clay and set down in her house with some others of his people whom she had sent for, and she gave them something to eat and drink. They sat eating and enjoying it. At the house-door she had some bullocks bound to wheels and a cart set ready. She herself sat in a back room cooking cakes. Her husband came and stood at the door. Seeing him, one old servant told his mistress that there was an elder at the door. âSalute him and bid him pass on.â


But though he did so repeatedly, he saw the monk remaining there and told his mistress. She came, and lifting up the curtain to see, she cried, âThis is the father of my sons.â She came out and saluted him: taking his bowl and making him enter she gave him food: when he had eaten she saluted again and said: âSir, you are a saint now: we have been staying in this house all this time; but there can be no proper householderâs life without a master, so we will take another house and go far into the country: be zealous in your good works, and forgive me if I am doing wrong.â For a time her husband was as if his heart would break. Then he said: âI cannot leave you, do not go, I will come back to my worldly life; send a laymanâs garment to such and such a place, I will give up my bowl and robes and come back to you.â She agreed. The monk went to his monastery, and giving up his bowl and robes to his teachers and instructors he explained, in answer to their questions, that he could not leave his wife and was going back to worldly life.


Against his will they took him to the Teacher and told him that he was discontent and wished to go back to worldly life.

The Teacher spoke thus to the monk, âIt is impossible to keep a guard over a woman; no guard can keep a woman in the right path. You yourself found in former days that all your safeguards were unavailing; and how can you now expect to have more success?â And so saying, he told this story of the past.

You do not know, RÄdha, later, halfway through the night who will come, you prattle foolishly, but KosiyÄyanÄ« is indifferent.

His lesson ended, the Teacher taught the Four Truths, at the close whereof the monk who hankered after the wife of his mundane life was established in the fruition of the First Path. âThis husband and wife,â said the Teacher, âwere the brahmin and his wife of those days, Änanda was RÄdha, and I myself Poá¹­á¹­hapÄda.â

## Full Story
âOur jaws are tired.â
 
{1.497}
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a number of aged monks. While they were still of the world, they were rich and wealthy householders of SÄvatthi, all friends of one another; and tradition tells us that while they were engaged in good works they heard the Teacher preach. At once they cried, âWe are old; what to us are house and home? Let us join the Saá¹gha, and following the Buddhaâs lovely dispensation make an end of sorrow.â


So they shared all their belongings amongst their children and families, and, leaving their tearful kindred, they came to ask the Teacher to receive them into the Saá¹gha. But when admitted, they did not live the life of monks; 
[1.311]
 and because of their age they failed to master the Dhamma. 
Buddhism combined reverence for age with mild contempt for aged novices who, after a mundane life, vouchsafed the rest of their days and faculties to a creed only to be mastered by hard thinking and ardent zeal.


As in their life as householders, so now too when they were monks they lived together, building themselves a cluster of neighbouring huts on the skirts of the monastery. Even when they went in quest of alms, they generally made for their wivesâ and childrenâs houses and ate there. In particular, all these old men were maintained by the bounty of the wife of one of their number, to whose house each brought what he had received and there ate it, with sauces and curries which she furnished.


An illness having carried her off, the aged monks went their way back to the monastery, and falling on one anotherâs necks walked about bewailing the death of their benefactress, the giver of sauces. The noise of their lamentation brought the monks to the spot to know what ailed them. And the aged men told how their kind benefactress was dead, and that they wept because they had lost her and should never see her like again.


Shocked at such impropriety, the monks talked together in the Dhamma Hall about the cause of the old menâs sorrow, and they told the Teacher too, on his entering the Hall and asking what they were discussing. âAh, monks,â said he, âin times past, also, this same womanâs death made them go about weeping and wailing; in those days she was a crow and was drowned in the sea, and these were toiling hard to empty all the water out of the sea in order to get her out, when the wise of those days saved them.â And so saying he told this story of the past.

Our jaws are tired, our mouths are dry, we must stop, not try to empty the sea, which is full to the brim.

His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThe aged monkâs wife was the female crow of those days, and her husband the male crow; the other aged monks were the rest of the crows, and I the Sea DevatÄ.â

âMonk,â said the Teacher, âshe is harmful to you.

## Full Story
âNot again, and never again.â
 
 [1.314]
 
{1.501}
 This story was told by the Teacher when at Jetavana, about subduing desires.


We are told that some five hundred rich friends, sons of merchants of SÄvatthi, by listening to the Teacherâs teachings were led to give their hearts to the dispensation, and that joining the Saá¹gha they lived in Jetavana in the part that AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika paved with gold pieces laid side by side. 
Or âpaved with crores.â See Vin Cv vi. 4. 9, translated in 
Sacred Books of the East
, Volume xx., page 188. 


Now in the middle of a certain night thoughts of lust took hold of them, and, in their distress, they set themselves to lay hold once again of the sensual desires they had renounced. In that hour the Teacher raised aloft the lamp of his omniscience to discover what manner of passion had hold of the monks in Jetavana, and, reading their hearts, perceived that lust and desire had sprung up within them. Like as a mother watches over her only child, or as a one-eyed man is careful of the one eye left him, even so watchful is the Teacher over his disciples; at morning or evening, at whatsoever hour their passions war against them, he will not let his faithful be overpowered but in that self-same hour subdues the raging sensual desires that beset them. Wherefore the thought came to him, âThis is like when thieves break into the city of an emperor; I will unfold the Dhamma straightaway to these monks, to the end that, subduing their sensual desires, I may raise them to Arahatship.â


So he came forth from his perfumed chamber, and in sweet tones called by name for the venerable elder, Änanda, Treasurer of the Dhamma. And the elder came and with due obeisance stood before the Teacher to know his pleasure. Then the Teacher bade him assemble together in his perfumed chamber all the monks who dwelt in that quarter of Jetavana. Tradition says that the Teacherâs thought was that if he summoned only those five hundred monks, they would conclude that he was aware of their lustful mood, and would be debarred by their agitation from receiving the Dhamma; accordingly he summoned all the monks who dwelt there. And the elder took a key and went from cell to cell summoning the monks till all were assembled in the perfumed chamber. Then he made ready the Buddha-seat. In stately dignity like Mount Sineru resting on the solid earth, the Teacher seated himself on the Buddha-seat, making a glory shine round him of paired garlands upon garlands of six-coloured light, which divided into masses of the size of a platter, of the size of a canopy, and of the size of a tower, until, like shafts of lightning, the rays reached to the heavens above. It was just like when the sun rises, stirring the ocean to the depths.


With reverent obeisance and reverent hearts, the monks entered and took their seats around him, encompassing him as it were within an orange curtain. Then in tones as of MahÄbrahma the Teacher 
{1.502}
 said: âMonks, a monk should not harbour the three evil thoughts â sensuality, ill-will and cruelty. Never let it be imagined that wicked desires are a trivial matter. For such desires are like an enemy; and an enemy is no trivial matter, but, given opportunity, works only destruction. Even so a desire, though small at its first arising, has only to be allowed to grow, in order to work utter destruction. Desire is like poison in food, like the itch in the skin, like a viper, like the thunderbolt of Sakka, ever to be shunned, ever to be feared. Whensoever desire arises, forthwith, without 
[1.315]
 finding a momentâs harbourage in the heart, it should be expelled by thought and reflection â like as a raindrop rolls at once off the leaf of the lotus. The wise of former times so hated even a slight desire that they crushed it out before it could grow larger.â And so saying, he told this story of the past.

Not again, and never again, also not again and again, will I enter the tuskerâs body, from that there is fear and fright.

His lesson ended, the Teacher said: âMonks, never let desires take root in the heart but pluck them out wheresoever they spring up.â 
{1.504}
 Having preached the Four Truths, at the close whereof those five hundred monks became an Arahat and the rest won varying lesser degrees of emancipation, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka as follows, âI was myself the jackal of those days.â

## Full Story
âThis tree has but one leaf.â
 This story was told about the Licchavi prince Duá¹­á¹­ha of VesÄlÄ« by the Teacher when he was living in the gabled house in the great forest near VesÄlÄ«. In those days VesÄlÄ« enjoyed marvellous prosperity. A triple wall encompassed the city, each wall a league distant from the next, and there were three gates with watch-towers. In that city there were always seven thousand seven hundred and seven kings to govern the kingdom, and a like number of viceroys, generals, and treasurers. Among the kingsâ sons was one known as Duá¹­á¹­halicchavikumÄra [Prince Wicked of the Licchavis], a fierce, passionate and cruel young man, always punishing, like an enraged viper. Such was his passionate nature that no one could say more than two or three words in his presence; and neither parents, kindred, nor friends could make him better. So at last his parents resolved to bring the ungovernable youth to the Supreme Buddha, realising that none but he could possibly tame their sonâs fierce spirit. So they brought him to the Teacher, whom, with due obeisance, they besought to read the youth a lecture.


Then the Teacher addressed the prince and said: âPrince, human beings should not be passionate or cruel or ferocious. The fierce man is one who is harsh and unkind alike to the mother that bore him, to his father and child, to his brothers and sisters, and to his wife, friends and kindred; inspiring terror like a viper darting forward to bite, like a robber springing on his victim in the forest, like a Yakkha advancing to devour, the fierce man straightaway will be reborn after this life in hell or other place of punishment; and even in this life, 
[1.317]
 however much adorned he is, he looks ugly. Be his face beautiful as the orb of the moon at the full, yet is it loathed as a lotus scorched by flames, as a disc of gold overworn with filth. It is such rage that drives men to slay themselves with the sword, to take poison, to hang themselves, and to throw themselves from precipices; and so it comes to pass that, meeting their death by reason of their own rage, they are reborn into torment. So too they who injure others, are hated even in this life and shall for their defilements pass at the bodyâs death to hell and punishment; and when once more they are born as men, 
{1.505}
 disease and sickness of eye and ear and of every kind ever beset them, from their birth onward. Wherefore let all men show kindness and be doers of good, and then assuredly hell and punishment have no fears for then.â


Such was the power of this one lecture upon the prince that his pride was humbled forthwith; his arrogance and selfishness passed from him, and his heart was turned to kindness and love. Nevermore did he revile or strike, but became gentle as a snake with drawn fangs, as a crab with broken claws, as a bull with broken horns.


Marking this change of mood, the monks talked together in the Dhamma Hall of how the Licchavi prince Duá¹­á¹­ha, whom the ceaseless exhortations of his parents could not curb, had been subdued and humbled with a single exhortation by the Supreme Buddha, and how this was like taming six rutting elephants at once. Well had it been said that, âThe elephant-tamer, monks, guides the elephant he is breaking in, making it to go to right or left, backward or forward, according to his will; in like manner the horse-tamer and the ex-tamer with horses and oxen; and so too the TathÄgata, the Supreme Buddha, guides the man he would train aright, guides him whithersoever he wills along any of the eight directions, and makes his pupil discern shapes external to himself. Such is the Buddha and he alone,â â and so forth, down to the words â âHe that is hailed as chief of the trainers of men, supreme in bowing men to the yoke of Dhamma.â 
[See MN 137
 Saá¸·Äyatanavibhaá¹gasutta
.]
 âFor, sirs,â said the monks, âthere is no trainer of men like unto the Supreme Buddha.â


And here the Teacher entered the Hall and questioned them as to what they were discussing. Then they told him, and he said: âMonks, this is not the first time that a single exhortation of mine has conquered the prince; the like happened before.â And so saying, he told this story of the past.

This tree has but one leaf, it is not four inches above the ground, it has fruit filled up with poison, what will it be when it is grown?

His lesson ended, the Teacher said: âSo, monks, this is not the first time that I have tamed prince Duá¹­á¹­ha; I did the same in days gone by.â Then he identified the JÄtaka by saying: âThe Licchavi prince Duá¹­á¹­ha of today was the prince Duá¹­á¹­ha of the story, Änanda the king, and I the ascetic who exhorted the prince to goodness.â

And such was the frenzy of his terror that he did not look out for his kingdomâs welfare, slept not upon his bed, but ranged abroad quaking in every limb, like a young elephant in an agony of pain. In fancy he saw the earth yawning for him, and the flames of hell darting forth; he could see himself fastened down on a bed of burning metal with iron lances being thrust into his body. Like a wounded chicken, not for one instant was he at peace.


The desire came on him to see the Supreme Buddha, to be reconciled to him, and to ask guidance of him; but because of the magnitude of his transgressions he shrank from coming into the Buddhaâs presence. When the KattikÄ [Autumn] festival came round, and by night RÄjagaha was illuminated and adorned like a city of the gods, the king, as he sat on high upon a throne of gold, saw JÄ«vaka KomÄrabhacca sitting near. The idea flashed across his mind to go with JÄ«vaka to the Buddha, but he felt he could not say outright that he would not go alone but wanted JÄ«vaka to take him. No; the better course would be, after praising the beauty of the night, 
{1.509}
 to propose sitting at the feet of some sage or brahmin, and to ask the courtiers what teacher can give the heart peace. Of course, they would severally praise their own masters; but JÄ«vaka would be sure to extol the Supreme Buddha; and to the Buddha the king with JÄ«vaka would go. So he burst into fivefold praises of the night, saying: âHow fair, sirs, is this clear cloudless night! How beautiful! How charming! How delightful! How lovely! 
These exclamations are misprinted as verse in the PÄli text. It is curious that the order is somewhat transposed here, as compared with the opening words of the 
SÄmaÃ±Ã±aphalasutta
.
 What sage or brahmin shall we seek out, to see if haply he may give our hearts peace?â


Then one minister recommended PÅ«raá¹a Kassapa, another Makkhali GosÄla, and others again Ajita Kesakambala, Kakudha KaccÄyana, SaÃ±jaya Belaá¹­á¹­hiputta, or Nigaá¹á¹­ha NÄthaputta. All these names the king heard in silence, waiting for his chief minister, JÄ«vaka, to speak. But JÄ«vaka, suspecting that the kingâs real object was to make him speak, kept silence in order to make sure. At last the king said: âWell, my good JÄ«vaka, why have you nothing to say?â At the word JÄ«vaka arose from his seat, and with hands clasped in adoration towards the Fortunate One, cried, âSire, yonder in my mango-grove dwells the Supreme Buddha with twelve hundred and fifty 
[Mistakenly translated as thirteen hundred and fifty in the original.]
 monks. This is the high fame that has arisen concerning him.â And here he proceeded to recite the nine titles of honour ascribed to him, beginning with âFortunate.â 
[It refers to the well known chant: 
Itipi so BhagavÄ

Arahaá¹
 2)

 When he had further shown how from his birth onwards the Buddhaâs powers had surpassed all the earlier presages and expectations, JÄ«vaka said: âUnto him, the Fortunate One, let the king repair, to hear the truth and to put questions.â


His object thus attained, the king asked JÄ«vaka to have the elephants got ready and went in royal state to JÄ«vakaâs mango-grove, where he found in the perfumed pavilion the TathÄgata amid the Saá¹gha, which was itself as tranquil as the ocean in perfect repose. Look where he would, the kingâs eye saw only the endless ranks of the monks, exceeding in numbers any following he had ever seen. Pleased with the demeanour of the monks, the king bowed low and spoke words of praise. Then saluting the Buddha, he seated himself, and asked him the question, âWhat is the fruit of the ascetic life?â And the Fortunate One gave utterance to the SÄmaÃ±Ã±aphala Sutta in two sections. 
[Although the discourse is not formerly divided into two 
bhÄá¹avÄras
, it is approximately that length.]
 Glad at heart, the king made his peace with the Buddha at the close of the Sutta, and rising up departed with solemn obeisance. Soon after the king had gone, 
[1.321]
 the Teacher addressed the monks and said: âMonks, this king is uprooted; 
{1.510}
 had not this king slain in lust for dominion that righteous ruler his father, he would have won the Arahatâs clear vision of the Dhamma, before he rose from his seat. But for his sinful favouring of Devadatta he has missed the fruit of the First Path.â 
Unlike the preceding sentence, this last sentence does not occur in the 
DÄ«ghanikÄya
. The interpolation is interesting as suggesting the license with which words were put into the Masterâs mouth by Buddhist authors.


Next day the monks talked together of all this and said that AjÄtasattuâs crime of parricide, which was due to that wicked and sinful Devadatta whom he had favoured, had lost him safety; and that Devadatta had been the kingâs ruin. At this point the Teacher entered the Dhamma Hall and asked the subject of their conversation. Being told, the Teacher said: âThis is not the first time, monks, that AjÄtasattu has suffered for favouring the sinful; like conduct in the past cost him his life.â So saying, he told this story of the past.

He who favours the bad, and mixes with the bad, makes fodder of himself, like SaÃ±jÄ«vaka and the tiger. 
[1.322]

His lesson ended the Teacher identified the JÄtaka by saying: âAjÄtasattu was the young brahmin of those days who brought the dead tiger to life, and I the world-famed teacher.â

 After his meal, with hands not yet dry, he proceeded in his splendid chariot to visit the Teacher; and the king saluted him, his feet beautiful like the open lotus flower, and sat down aside.


Then the Teacher addressed him in these words. âWhy, my lord king, what brings you here at this time of day?â âSir,â said he, âI missed my time because I was sitting on a difficult case, involving moral wrong; now I have finished it, and eaten, and here I am, with my hands hardly dry, to wait upon you.â âMy lord king,â replied the Teacher, âto judge a cause with justice and impartiality is the right thing; that is the way to heaven. Now when you first have the advice of a being all-wise like me, it is no wonder if you should judge your case fairly and justly; but the wonder is when kings have only had the advice of scholars who are not all-wise, and yet have decided fairly and justly, avoiding the Four Ways of Wickedness, and observing the Ten Royal Virtues, and after ruling justly have gone to swell the hosts of heaven.â Then, at the kingâs request, he told a story of the past.

He pits the strong against the strong, Ballika, the soft with softness, the good overcomes with goodness, the bad overcomes with badness, of such a kind is this our king, get off the path, charioteer.

He overcomes anger with non-anger, overcomes bad with goodness, overcomes stinginess with a gift, and lying speech with the truth, of such a kind is this our king, get off the path, charioteer!

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, which he began for the purpose of giving a lesson to the king of Kosala, he identified the JÄtaka, âMoggallÄna was then the driver of king Mallika, Änanda was the king, SÄriputta was the driver of the king of Benares, but I myself was the king.â

## Full Story
âWho rashly undertakes.â
 This story the Teacher told while staying in his gabled chamber, about a barber who lived at VesÄli.


This man, as we are told, used to do shaving and hairdressing and cross-plaiting for the royal household, kings and queens, princes and princesses, indeed he did all of that kind that had to be done. He was a true believer, sheltered in the Three Refuges, 
Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saá¹gha.
 resolved to keep the Five Precepts; and from time to time he would listen to the Teacherâs discourses.


One day he set out to do his work in the palace, taking his son with him. The young fellow, seeing a Licchavi girl dressed up fine and grand, like a DevaccharÄ, fell in love for desire of her. He said to his father, as they left the palace in company, âThere is a girl, if I get her, I shall live; but if I donât, thereâs nothing but death for me.â He would not touch a morsel of food, but lay down hugging the bedstead. His father found him and said: âWhy, son, donât set your mind on forbidden fruit. You are a nobody, a barberâs son; this Licchavi girl is a highborn lady. Youâre no match for her. Iâll find you somebody else; a girl of your own place and station.â But the lad would not listen to him. Then came mother, brother, and sister, aunt and uncle, all his kinsfolk, and all his friends and companions, trying to pacify him; but pacify him they could not. So he pined and pined away, and lay there until he died.


Then the father performed his obsequies, and did what is usual to do for the spirits of the dead. 
{2.6}
 By and by, when the first edge of grief had worn off, he thought he would wait upon the Teacher. Taking a large present of flowers, scents, and perfumes, he repaired to the Great Grove, and did reverence to the Teacher, saluted him, and sat down on one side. âWhy have you kept out of sight all this time, layman?â the Teacher asked. Then the man told him what had happened. Said the Teacher, âAh, layman, âtis not the first time he has perished by setting his heart on what he must not have; this is only what he has done before.â Then at the laymanâs request, he told a story of the past.
 [2.5]

Those who quickly undertake work, without consideration, fall, they regret those works, like they would something hot crammed into the mouth.
{2.8}

The lion resounded with a lionâs roar on the mount Daddara, having heard the lionâs shout, a jackal who dwelt near Daddara experienced fright, became terrified, and his heart burst apart.
{2.9}

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he revealed the Truths, and identified the JÄtaka, at the conclusion of the Truths, the layman was established in the Fruit of the First Path. âThe barberâs son of today was then the jackal; the Licchavi girl was the young lioness; the six younger lions are now six elders; and I myself was the eldest lion.â

## Full Story
âYou are a fourfoot.â
 This is a story told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a certain elder well stricken in years.


Once, we are told, there happened to be a night service, and the Teacher had preached standing upon a slab of the jewelled staircase at the door of his scented cell. After delivering a Sugataâs discourse, he retired into his scented chamber; and the Captain of the Dhamma, saluting his Teacher, went back to his own cell again. MahÄmoggallÄna too retired to his cell, and after a momentâs rest returned to ask the elder SÄriputta a question. As he asked and asked each question, the Captain of the Dhamma made it all clear, as though he were making the moon rise in the sky. There were present the four classes of disciples, 
Monks, nuns, laymen and laywomen.
 who sat and heard it all.


Then a thought came into the mind of one aged elder. âSuppose,â he thought: âI can puzzle SÄriputta before all this crowd, by asking him some question? They will all think, âWhat a clever fellow!â And I shall gain great credit and repute.â So he rose up in the crowd, and stepping near to the elder, stood on one side, and said: âFriend SÄriputta, I too have a question for you; will you let me speak? Give me a decision in discrimination or in undiscrimination, in refutation or in acceptation, in distinction or in counter-distinction.â 
These words appear to be nonsense.
 The elder looked at him. âThis old man,â he thought, âstands within the sphere of desire still; he is empty, and knows nothing.â He said not a single word to him for very shame; laying his fan down, he rose from his seat, 
{2.10}
 and returned to his cell. And elder MoggallÄna likewise returned to his cell.


The bystanders jumped up, crying, âSeize this wicked old fellow, who wouldnât let us hear the sweet words of the sermon!â and they mobbed him. Off he ran, and fell through a hole in the corner of a cesspool just outside the monastery; when he got up he was covered all over with filth. When the people saw him, they felt sorry for it, and went away to the Teacher. He asked, âWhy have you come at this unseasonable hour, laymen?â They told him what had happened. âLaymen,â said he, âthis is not the only time this old man has been pulled up, and not knowing his own power, pitted himself against the strong, only to be covered all over with filth. Long, long ago he knew not his powers, pitted himself against the strong, and was covered with filth as he is covered now.â Then, at their request, he told them a story of the past. 
[2.8]

âI am four-footed, friend, you are four-footed, friend, come, friend, turn back, why do you run away in fear?â 
{2.11}

âYour coat is foul, unclean, you truly smell bad, boar, if you desire to fight, I give you victory, friend.â 
[2.9]

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he identified the JÄtaka, âThe boar of those days is now the ancient elder, and I myself was the lion.â

âConcealed within a stone.â
 This story the Teacher told at Jetavana, about a soldiersâ quarrel.


Tradition tells how two soldiers, in the service of the king of Kosala, of high rank, and great persons at court, no sooner caught sight of one another than they used to exchange ill words. Neither king, nor friends, nor kinsfolk could make them agree.


It happened one day that early in the morning the Teacher, looking around to see which of his disciples were ripe for release, perceived that these two were ready to enter upon the First Path. Next day he went all alone seeking alms in SÄvatthi, and stopped before the door of one of them, who came out and took the Teacherâs bowl; then led him within, and offered him a seat. The Teacher sat, and then enlarged on the profit of cultivating loving-kindness. When he saw the manâs mind was ready, he declared the Truths. This done, the other was established in the Fruit of the First Path. Seeing this, the Teacher persuaded him to take the bowl; then rising he proceeded to the house of the other. Out came the other, and after salutation given, begged the Teacher to enter, and gave him a seat. He also took the Teacherâs bowl, and entered along with him. To him the Teacher lauded the Eleven Blessings of Loving-kindness; 
[
MettÄnisaá¹sasutta
, AN 11.16.]
 and perceiving that his heart was ready, declared the Truths. And this done, he too became established in the Fruit of the First Path.


Thus they were both converted; they confessed their faults one to the other, and asked forgiveness; peaceful and harmonious, they were at one together. That very same day they ate together in the presence of the Fortunate One.


His meal over, the Teacher returned to the monastery. They both returned with him, bearing a rich present of flowers, scents and perfumes, of ghee, honey, and sugar. The Teacher, having preached of duty 
{2.13}
 before the Saá¹gha, and uttered a Sugataâs discourse, retired to his scented chamber.


Next morning, the monks talked the matter over in the Dhamma Hall. âFriend,â one would say to another, âour Teacher subdues the unsubdued.
 [2.10]
 Why, here are these two grand persons, who have been quarrelling all this time, and could not be reconciled by the king himself, or friends and kinsfolk: and the TathÄgata has humbled them in a single day!â The Teacher came in, âWhat are you talking about,â asked he, âas you sit here together?â They told him. Said he, âMonks, this is not the first time that I have reconciled these two; in bygone ages I reconciled the same two persons.â And he told a story of the past.

Here amongst the snakes the noble one has entered, being a rock with colour, desiring safety. Paying homage to the holy man of high class, though hungry, I overcame the desire to eat.

Guarded by Brahma, may you live for a long time, and may divine food manifest itself to you. Whoever, honouring the holy man of class, though hungry, you overcame the desire to eat.

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he identified the JÄtaka, saying: âIn those days, the two great personages were the NÄga and the Supaá¹á¹a, and I myself was the recluse.â

 This story the Teacher told when he was staying in the monastery made by king Pasenadi in front of Jetavana; it was about a sneeze which he gave.


One day, we are told, as the Teacher sat discoursing with four persons round him, he sneezed. âLong life to the Fortunate One, long life to the Buddha!â the monks all cried aloud, and made a great to-do.


The noise interrupted the discourse. Then the Teacher said to the monks, âWhy, monks, if one cry âLong life!â on hearing a sneeze, does a man live or die any the more for that?â They answered, âNo, no, sir.â He went on, âYou should not cry âLong lifeâ for a sneeze, monks. Whosoever does so is guilty of wrong.â


It is said that at that time, when the monks sneezed, people used to call out, âLong life to you, sir!â But the monks had their scruples, and made no answer. Everybody was annoyed, and asked, âPray, why is it that the monastics about the ascetic Son of the Sakyas make no answer, when they sneeze, and somebody or other wishes them long life?â


All this was told to the Fortunate One. He said: âMonks, common folk are superstitious. When you sneeze, and they say, âLong life to you, sir!â I permit you to answer, âThe same to you.â â Then the monks asked him, âSir, when did people begin to answer âLong lifeâ by âThe same to youâ?â Said the Teacher, âThat was long, long ago,â and he told them a tale of the olden time.

Live for a hundred years, Bhagga, and for a further twenty years, may no PisÄcas eat me up, may you live a hundred seasons.

May you live for a hundred years, and for a further twenty years, may the PisÄcas eat poison, may you live a hundred seasons.

âAlÄ«na took king Kosala.â
 This story the Teacher told at Jetavana, about a fainthearted monk. The circumstances will be set forth in the Saá¹varajÄtaka [Ja 462] in the eleventh Book.

This story the Teacher told while dwelling in Jetavana, about a monk who had ceased to strive. This, we learn, was a young man of family, who lived in SÄvatthi. Having heard the Teacherâs discoursing, he renounced the world. Fulfilling the tasks imposed by his teachers and preceptors, he learned by heart both the PÄtimokkhas.


When five years were past, he said: âWhen I have been instructed in the mode of attaining Absorption, I will go dwell in the forest.â Then he took leave of his teachers and preceptors, and proceeded to a frontier village in the kingdom of Kosala. The people were pleased with his behaviour, and he made a hut of leaves and there was attended to.


Entering upon the rainy season, zealous, eager, striving in strenuous endeavour he strove after Absorption for the space of three months: but of this not a trace could he produce. Then he thought: âVerily I am the most devoted to worldly conditions among the four classes of men taught by the Teacher! What have I to do with living in the forest?â Then he said to himself, âI will return to Jetavana, and there in beholding the beauty of the TathÄgata, and hearing his discourse sweet as honey, I will pass my days.â So he relaxed his striving; and setting forth he came in course of time to Jetavana. His preceptors and teachers, his friends and acquaintances asked him the cause of his coming. He informed them, and they reproved him for it, asking him why he had done so.


Then they led him into the Teacherâs presence. âWhy, monks,â said the Teacher, âdo you lead a monk here against his will?â They replied, âThis monk has come here because he has relaxed his striving.â

When the Teacher asked this monk if he really were fainthearted, as was said, he replied, 
{2.18}
 âYes, Fortunate One.â To which the Teacher said: âWhat, monk! In former days did you not gain supremacy over the kingdom of Benares, twelve leagues either way, and give it to a baby boy, like a lump of flesh and nothing more, and all this just by perseverance! And now that you have embraced this dispensation, are you to lose heart and faint?â And he told a story of olden days. 
[2.14]

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, having become perfectly enlightened, he repeated this couple of verses:

Great forces, who were pleased, relying on prince AlÄ«nacitta, captured king Kosala alive, who was displeased with his army.

So, being endowed with support the monk, with effort established, by cultivating wholesome thoughts, in order to attain safety, gradually arrives at the destruction of all of the fetters. 
{2.23}

And so the Teacher, bringing his teaching to a climax in the deathless and great NibbÄna, went on to declare the Truths, and then identified the JÄtaka, after the Truths, this discontented monk became an Arahat, âShe who now is MahÄmÄyÄ was then the mother; this discontented monk was the elephant who took the kingdom and handed it over to the child; SÄriputta was the father elephant, and I myself was the young prince.â

In the present the king of Kosala gives 1,000 robes to Elder Änanda, who then gives 500 to monks in need, and 500 to his attendant monk, who passes them to other novices. The king asks the Buddha if this is right, and the latter tells a story of how a jackal saved a lion, and the lion thereafter looked after the jackal and his family.

## Full Story
âThe strong will always have their way.â
 This was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana after elder Änanda received a present of a thousand robes. The elder had been preaching to the ladies of the king of Kosalaâs palace as described above in the MahÄsÄrajÄtaka [Ja 92].

Once the wives of the king of Kosala thought among themselves, as follows, âVery rare is the coming of a Buddha; and very rare is birth in a human form with all oneâs faculties in perfection. Yet, though we have happened on a human form in a Buddhaâs lifetime, we cannot go at will to the monastery to hear the truth from his own lips, to do obeisance, and to make offerings to him. We live here as in a box. Let us ask the king to send for a fitting monk to come here and teach us the truth. Let us learn what we can from him, and be charitable and do good works, to the end that we may profit by our having been born at this happy juncture.â So they all went in a body to the king, and told him what was in their minds; and the king gave his consent.


Now it fell out on a day that the king was minded to take his pleasure in the royal pleasure gardens, and gave orders that the grounds should be made ready for his coming. As the gardener was working away, he espied the Teacher seated at the foot of a tree. So he went to the king and said: âThe pleasure gardens is made ready, sire; but the Fortunate One is sitting there at the foot of a tree.â âVery good,â said the king, âwe will go and hear the Teacher.â Mounting his chariot of state, he went to the Teacher in the pleasure gardens.


Now there was then seated at the Teacherâs feet, listening to his teaching, a lay brother named ChattapÄá¹i [Parasol Holder], who had entered the Third Path. On catching sight of this lay brother, the king hesitated; but, on reflection that this must be a virtuous man, or he would not be sitting by the Teacher for instruction, he approached and with a bow seated himself on one side of the Teacher. Out of reverence for the supreme Buddha, the lay brother neither rose in the kingâs honour nor saluted his majesty; and this made the king very angry. Noticing the kingâs displeasure, the Teacher proceeded to extol the merits of that lay brother, saying: âSire, this lay brother is master of all tradition; he knows by heart the discourses that have been handed down; and he has set himself free from the bondage of passion.â âSurely,â thought the king, âhe whose praises the Teacher is telling can be no ordinary person.â And he said to him, âLet me know, lay brother, if you are in need of anything.â âThank you,â said the man. Then the king listened to the Teacherâs teaching, and at its close rose up and ceremoniously withdrew.


Another day, meeting that same lay brother going after breakfast umbrella in hand to Jetavana, the king had him summoned to his presence and said: âI hear, lay brother, that you are a man of great learning. Now my wives are very anxious to hear and learn the truth; I should be glad if you would teach them.â âIt is not meet, sire, that a layman should expound or teach the truth in the kingâs harem; that is the prerogative of the monks.â


Recognising the force of this remark, the king, after dismissing the layman, called his wives together and announced to them his intention of sending to the Teacher for one of the monks to come as their instructor in the Dhamma. Which of the eighty chief disciples would they have? After talking it over together, the ladies with one accord chose Änanda the elder, surnamed the Treasurer of the Dhamma [Dhammabhaá¹á¸ÄgÄrika]. So the king went to the Teacher and with a courteous greeting sat down by his side, after which he proceeded to state his wivesâ wish, and his own hope, that Änanda might be their teacher. The Teacher, having consented to send Änanda, the kingâs wives now began to be regularly taught by the elder and to learn from him.

As he preached there in the manner described, 
{2.24}
 a thousand robes, worth each a thousand pieces of money, were brought to the king. Of these the king 
[2.18]
 gave five hundred to as many of his queens. The ladies put these aside and made them a present to our elder, and then the next day in their old ones went to the palace where the king took breakfast. The king remarked, âI gave you dresses worth a thousand pieces each. Why are you not wearing them?â âMy lord,â they said, âwe have given them to the elder.â âHas elder Änanda got them all?â he asked. They said: âYes, he has.â âThe Supreme Buddha,â said he, âallows only three robes. Änanda is doing a little trade in cloth, I suppose!â


He was angry with the elder; and after breakfast, visited him in his cell, and after greeting, sat down, with these words: âPray, sir, do my ladies learn or listen to your preaching?â


âYes, sire; they learn what they ought, and what they ought to hear, they hear.â


âOh, indeed. Do they only listen, or do they make you presents of upper garments or under-garments?â


âToday, sire, they have given me five hundred robes worth a thousand pieces each.â


âAnd you accepted them, sir?â


âYes, sire, I did.â


âWhy, sir, didnât the Teacher make some rule about three robes?â


âTrue, sire, for every monk three robes is the rule, speaking of what he uses for himself. But no one is forbidden to accept what is offered; and that is why I took them â to give them to monks whose robes are worn out.â


âBut when these monks get them from you, what do they do with their old ones?â âMake them into a cloak.â âAnd what about the old cloak?â âThat they turn into a shirt.â âAnd the old shirt?â âThat serves for a coverlet.â âThe old coverlet?â âBecomes a mat.â 
{2.25}
 âThe old mat?â âA towel.â âAnd what about the old towel?â


âSire, it is not permitted to waste the gifts of the faithful; so they chop up the old towel into bits, and mix the bits with clay, which they use for mortar in building their houses.â


âA gift, sir, ought not to be destroyed, not even a towel.â


âWell, sir king, we destroy no gifts, but all are used somehow.â


This conversation pleased the king so much, that he sent for the other five hundred robes which remained, and gave them to the elder. Then, after receiving his thanks, he greeted the elder in solemn state, and went his way.


The elder gave the first five hundred robes to monks whose robes were worn out. But the number of his fellow monastics was just five hundred. One of these, a young monk, was very useful to the elder; sweeping out his cell, serving him with food and drink, giving him toothbrush and water for cleansing his mouth, looking after the privies, living rooms, and sleeping rooms, and doing all that was needed for hand, foot, or back. To him, as his by right for all his great service, the elder gave all the five hundred robes which he had received afterwards. The young monk in his turn distributed them among his fellow-students. These all cut them up, dyed them yellow as a kaá¹ikÄra 
Pterospermum acerifolium
.
 flower; then dressed therein they waited upon the Teacher, greeted him, and sat down on one side.


âSir,â they asked, âis it possible for a holy disciple who has entered on the First Path to be a respecter of persons in his gifts?â âNo, monks, it is not possible for holy disciples to be respecters of persons in their gifts.â âSir, our spiritual teacher, the Treasurer of the Dhamma, gave five hundred robes, each worth a thousand pieces, to a young monk; and he has divided them amongst us.â âMonks, in giving these Änanda was no respecter of persons. 
{2.26}
 That young fellow was a very useful servant; so he made the present to his own attendant for the sake of his service, for the sake of his goodness, 
[2.19]
 and by right, thinking that one good turn deserves another, and with a wish to do what gratitude demands. In former days, as now, wise men acted on the principle one good turn deserves another.â And then, at their request, he told them a story of the past.

The nature of one strong is he dismisses whatever he likes, beast. UnnadantÄ«, know you this: fear has arisen from our refuge. 
{2.29}

Although he is a weak friend, he is established in friendliness, he is my relative and kin, that friend is a comrade to me, O sharp-fanged one, do not despise him, that jackal preserved my life! 
[2.21]

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he declared the Truths and identified the JÄtaka, at the end of the Truths some entered on the First Path, some on the Second, some on the Third, and some the Fourth, âÄnanda was the jackal in those days, and the lion was I myself.â

âBirds of a feather.â
 This story the Teacher told while at Jetavana, about two hot-tempered monks.


It happened that there were two monks, passionate, cruel, and violent, one living at Jetavana and one in the country. Once the country monk came to Jetavana on some errand or other. The novices and young monks knew the passionate nature of this man, so they led him to the cell of the other, all agog to see them quarrel. No sooner did they spy one another, those two hot-tempered men, than they ran into each otherâs arms, stroking and caressing hands, and feet, and back!


The monks talked about it in the Dhamma Hall. âFriend, these passionate monks are cross, cruel, angry to everybody else, but with each other they are the best of friends, cordial and sympathetic!â The Teacher came in, asking what they sat there talking about? They told him. Said he, âThis, monks, is not the only time that these men, who are cross, cruel, and angry to all else, have shown themselves cordial, and friendly, and sympathetic to each other. It happened just so in olden days,â and so saying, he told a story of the past.

Suhanu does not have bad behaviour with Soá¹a in this place, Suhanu is of such a kind, and Soá¹a his companion. 
{2.32}

The transgressor and the arrogant always bite on the tether, the wicked agree with the wicked, the bad agree with the bad.

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he identified the JÄtaka, âThe bad monks were then these two horses, Änanda was the king, and I was the wise counsellor.â

 where Devadatta imitated the Buddha, and fell; the elders then both returned, after delivering a discourse, taking with them their own pupils. On arriving at Veá¸·uvana, the Teacher asked them what Devadatta had done when he saw them? 
{2.39}
 âSir,â they said, âhe

 imitated the Buddha, and was utterly destroyed.â The Teacher answered, âIt is not only now, SÄriputta, that Devadatta came to dire destruction by mimicking me; it was just the same before.â Then at the elderâs request, he told a story of the past.

So, what if the king of Videha, of the house of MithilÄ, is carried on his thoroughbred horses, so VinÄ«laka is carried on geese.

{2.41}
 This is a story told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a wilful person; and the circumstances will be found in the GijjhajÄtaka [Ja 427], of the Ninth Book.

This story the Teacher told at Jetavana concerning a disobedient monk. He was, they say, of gentle birth, and though ordained in the dispensation that leads to safety, was admonished by his well-wishers, masters, teachers, and fellow-students to this effect, âThus must you advance and thus retreat; thus look at or away from objects; thus must the arm be stretched out or drawn back; thus are the inner and outer garment to be worn; thus is the bowl to be held, and when you have received sufficient food to sustain life, after self-examination, thus are you to partake of it, keeping guard over the door of the senses; in eating you are to be moderate and exercise watchfulness; you are to recognize such and such duties towards monks who come to or go from the monastery; these are the fourteen sets of monastic duties, and the eighty great duties to be duly performed; these are the thirteen ascetic practices; all these are to be scrupulously performed.â Yet was he disobedient and impatient, and did not receive instruction respectfully, but refused to listen to them, saying: âI do not find fault with you. Why do you speak thus to me? I shall know what is for my good, and what is not.â


Then the monks, hearing of his disobedience, sat in the Dhamma Hall, telling of his faults. The Teacher came and asked them what it was they were discussing, and sent for the monk and said: âIs it true, monk, that you are disobedient?â And he confessed that it was so.

The Teacher said to this monk, âIn olden days, as now, you were wilful and careless of wise menâs advice, and you were trampled to death by a mad elephant because of it.â And he told a story of the past.

Have no intimacy with a bad person, the noble know the worth of the ignoble. Eventually he does what is wicked, like the elephant to IndasamÄna.

But he of whom you know: He is like I, having virtue and wisdom and learning, with him one should certainly be friendly, happy is the meeting with a good person. 
{2.43}

After concluding this discourse, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka, âThis unruly fellow was then IndasamÄnagotta, and I was myself the teacher of the ascetic band.â

 This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana, about feeding the sacred fire. The circumstances are the same as those of the Naá¹guá¹­á¹­hajÄtaka [Ja 144] related above.

This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, touching the false austerity of the ÄjÄ«vikas, or naked ascetics. Tradition tells us that behind Jetavana they used to practise false austerities. A number of the monks saw them there painfully squatting on their heels, swinging in the air like bats, reclining on thorns, scorching themselves with five fires, and so forth in their various false austerities.

The monks, on seeing those who kept up the fires, said to the Fortunate One, âSir, here are topknot ascetics practising all sorts of false asceticism. Whatâs the good of it?â âThere is no 
[2.30]
 good in it,â said the Teacher. âIt has happened before that even wise men have imagined some good in feeding the sacred fire, but after doing this for a long time, have found out that there is no good in it, and have quenched it with water, and beat it down, beat it down with sticks, never giving it so much as a look afterwards.â Then he told them a story.

Nothing is worse than the intimacy of one intimate with a bad person. The fire that burned with ghee and with milk-rice burned down my leaf-hut, made with much trouble.

Nothing is better than intimacy of one intimate with a good person. The lionâs, tigerâs and leopardâs face the Sambar deer licks intimately.

âFive score black elephants.â
 This story the Teacher told at Jetavana, about arbitrary giving of alms.


We hear that at SÄvatthi, a family used sometimes to give alms to the Buddha and his disciples, sometimes they used to give to the heretics, or else the givers would form themselves into companies, or again the people of one street would club together, or the whole of the inhabitants would collect voluntary offerings, and present them.


On this occasion all the inhabitants had made such a collection of all necessaries; but counsels were divided, some demanding that this be given to the heretics, some speaking for those who followed the Buddha. Each party stuck to their point, the disciples of the heretics voting for the heretics, and the disciples of Buddha for Buddhaâs company. Then it was proposed to divide upon the question, and accordingly they divided; those who were for the Buddha were in the majority.


So their plan was followed, and the disciples of the heretics could not prevent the gifts being offered to the Buddha and his followers.


The citizens gave invitation to the Buddhaâs company; for seven days they set rich offerings before them, and on the seventh gave over all the articles they had collected. The Teacher returned thanks, 
{2.46}
 after which he instructed a host of people in the fruition of the Paths. Next he returned to Jetavana; and when his followers had done their duties, he delivered a Sugataâs discourse standing before his scented chamber, into which he then retired.


At evening time the monks talked the matter over together in the Dhamma Hall, âFriend, how the hereticsâ disciples tried to prevent this from coming to the saints! Yet they couldnât do it; all the collection of articles was laid before the saintsâ own feet. Ah, how great is the Buddhaâs power!â âWhat is this you are talking about now together?â asked the Teacher, coming in. They told him. âMonks,â said he, âthis is not the first time that the disciples of the heretics have tried to thwart an offering which should have been made to me. They did the same before; but always these articles have been finally laid at my feet.â So saying, he told them a tale of long ago. 
[2.32]

These black creatures, who are white tusked, are mine, over a hundred, covered over with gold, âI give these to you,â said king SusÄ«ma, in remembrance of my dead ancestors.

## Full Story
âA vulture sees a corpse.â
 This story the Teacher told about a monk who had his mother to support. The circumstances will be related under the SÄmajÄtaka [Ja 540].

This story the Teacher told at Jetavana, about a certain monk who supported his mother. They say that there was a wealthy merchant at SÄvatthi, who was worth eighteen crores; and he had a son who was very dear and winning to his father and mother. One day the youth went upon the terrace of the house, and opened a window and looked down on the street; and when he saw the great crowd going to Jetavana with perfumes and garlands in their hands to hear the Dhamma preached, he exclaimed that he would go too.


So having ordered perfumes and garlands to be brought, he went to the monastery, and having distributed robes, medicines, drinks, etc. to the assembly and honoured the Fortunate One with perfumes and garlands, he sat down on one side. After hearing the Dhamma, and perceiving the evil consequences of desire and the blessings arising from adopting the ascetic life, when the assembly broke up he asked the Fortunate One for ordination, but he was told that the TathÄgatas do not ordain anyone who has not obtained the permission of his parents; so he went away, and lived a week without food, and having at last obtained his parentsâ consent, he returned and begged for ordination. The Teacher sent a monk who ordained him; and after he was ordained he obtained great honour and gain; he won the favour of his teachers and preceptors, and having received full orders he mastered the Dhamma in five years.


Then he thought to himself, âI live here distracted â it is not suitable for me,â and he became anxious to reach the goal of spiritual insight; so having obtained instruction in meditation from his teacher, he departed to a frontier village and dwelt in the forest, and there having entered a course of insight, however much he laboured and strove for twelve years, he failed to attain any special insight.


His parents also, as time went on, became poor, for those who hired their land or carried on merchandise for them, finding out that there was no son or brother in the family to enforce the payment, seized what they could lay their hands upon and ran away as they pleased, and the servants and labourers in the house seized the gold and coin and made off therewith, so that at the end the two were reduced to an evil plight and had not even a jug for pouring water; and at last they sold their dwelling, and finding themselves homeless, and in extreme misery, they wandered begging for alms, clothed in rags and carrying potsherds in their hands.


Now at that time a monk came from Jetavana to the sonâs place of abode; he performed the duties of hospitality and, as he sat quietly, he first asked whence he was come; and learning that he was come from Jetavana he asked after the health of the Teacher and the principal disciples and then asked for news of his parents, âTell me, sir, about the welfare of such and such a merchantâs family in SÄvatthi.â âO friend, donât ask for news of that family.â âWhy not, sir?â âThey say that there was one son in that family, but he has become an ascetic in this dispensation, and since he left the world that family has gone to ruin; and at the present time the two old people are reduced to a most lamentable state and beg for alms.â


When he heard the otherâs words he could not remain unmoved, but began to weep with his eyes full of tears, and when the other asked him why he wept, âO sir,â he replied, âthey are my own father and mother, I am their son.â âO friend, your father and mother have come to ruin through you â do you go and take care of them.â âFor twelve years,â he thought to himself, âI have laboured and striven but never been able to attain the Path or the Fruit: I must be incompetent; what have I to do with the ascetic life? I will become a householder and will support my parents and give away my wealth, and will thus eventually become destined for heaven.â


So having determined he gave up his abode in the forest to the elder, and the next day departed and by successive stages reached the monastery at the back of Jetavana which is not far from SÄvatthi. There he found two roads, one leading to Jetavana, the other to SÄvatthi. As he stood there, he thought: âShall I see my parents first or the One with Ten Powers?â Then he said to himself, âIn old days I saw my parents for a long time, from henceforth I shall rarely have the chance of seeing the Buddha; I will see the Fully Awakened One today and hear the Dhamma, and then tomorrow morning I will see my parents.â So he left the road to SÄvatthi and in the evening arrived at Jetavana.


Now that very day at daybreak, the Teacher, as he looked upon the world, had seen the potentialities of this young man, and when he came to visit him he praised the virtues of parents in the MÄtiposakasutta [SN 7.19]. As he stood at the end of the assembly of elders and listened, he thought: âIf I become a householder I can support my parents; but the Teacher also says, âA son who has become an ascetic can be helpful,â I went away before without seeing the Teacher, and I failed in such an imperfect ordination; I will now support my parents while still remaining an ascetic without becoming a householder.â So he took his ticket and his ticket-food and gruel, and felt as if he had committed a wrong deserving expulsion after a solitary abode of twelve years in the forest. In the morning he went to SÄvatthi and he thought to himself, âShall I first get the gruel or see my parents?â He reflected that it would not be right to visit them in their poverty empty-handed; so he first got the gruel and then went to the door of their old house.


When he saw them sitting by the opposite wall after having gone their round for the alms given in broth, he stood not far from them in a sudden burst of sorrow with his eyes full of tears. They saw him but knew him not; then his mother, thinking that it was someone standing for alms, said to him, âWe have nothing fit to be given to you, be pleased to pass on.â When he heard her, he repressed the grief which filled his heart and remained still standing as before with his eyes full of tears, and when he was addressed a second and a third time he still continued standing.


At last the father said to the mother, âGo to him; can this be your son?â She rose and went to him and, recognising him, fell at his feet and lamented, and the father also joined his lamentations, and there was a loud outburst of sorrow. To see his parents he could not control himself, but burst into tears; then, after yielding to his feelings, he said: âDo not grieve, I will support you,â so having comforted them and made them drink some gruel, and sit down on one side, he went again and begged for some food and gave it to them, and then went and asked for alms for himself, and having finished his meal, took up his abode at a short distance off.


From that day forward he watched over his parents in this manner; he gave them all the alms he received for himself, even those at the fortnightly distributions, and he went on separate expeditions for his own alms, and ate them; and whatever food he received as provision for the rainy season he gave to them, while he took their worn-out garments and dyed them with the doors fast closed and used them himself; but the days were few when he gained alms and there were many when he failed to win anything, and his inner and outer clothing became very rough.


As he watched over his parents he gradually grew very pale and thin and his friends and intimates said to him, âYour complexion used to be bright, but now you have become very pale â has some illness come upon you?â He replied, âNo illness has come upon me, but a hindrance has befallen me,â and he told them the history. âSir,â they replied, âthe Teacher does not allow us to waste the offerings of the faithful, you do an unlawful act in giving to laymen the offerings of the faithful.â When he heard this he shrank away ashamed.


But not satisfied with this they went and told it to the Teacher, saying: âSo and so, sir, has wasted the offerings of the faithful and used them to feed laymen.â

The Teacher asked him whether he, a monk, was really supporting persons who were still living in the world. This the monk admitted, âHow are they related to you?â the Teacher went on. âThey are my parents, sir.â âExcellent, excellent,â the Teacher said; and bade the monks not be angry with this monk. âWise men of old,â said he, âhave done service even to those who were not of kin to them; but this manâs task has been to support his own parents.â So saying, he told them this story of bygone days.

It is known a vulture can see corpses a hundred leagues away, why did you not know after arriving at the net and the snare? 
{2.52}

When a creature is in decline and life is coming to an end, then he does not know after arriving at the net and the snare.

This lesson ended, the Teacher declared the Truths, and identified the JÄtaka, at the conclusion of the Truths the dutiful monk was established in the fruition of the First Path, âÄnanda was the king of those days; SÄriputta was the merchant; and I myself was the vulture that supported his parents.â

## Full Story
âCreature, your egg-born enemy.â
 This story the Teacher told during a sojourn at Jetavana, about two officers who had a quarrel. The circumstances have been given above in the UragajÄtaka [Ja 154].

Tradition tells how two soldiers, in the service of the king of Kosala, of high rank, and great persons at court, no sooner caught sight of one another than they used to exchange ill words. Neither king, nor friends, nor kinsfolk could make them agree.


It happened one day that early in the morning the Teacher, looking around to see which of his friends were ripe for release, perceived that these two were ready to enter upon the First Path. Next day he went all alone seeking alms in SÄvatthi, and stopped before the door of one of them, who came out and took the Teacherâs bowl; then led him within, and offered him a seat. The Teacher sat, and then enlarged on the profit of cultivating loving-kindness. When he saw the manâs mind was ready, he declared the Truths. This done, the other was established in the Fruit of the First Path. Seeing this, the Teacher persuaded him to take the bowl; then rising he proceeded to the house of the other. Out came the other, and after salutation given, begged the Teacher to enter, and gave him a seat. He also took the Teacherâs bowl, and entered along with him. To him the Teacher lauded the Eleven Blessings of Loving-kindness; and perceiving that his heart was ready, declared the Truths. And this done, he too became established in the Fruit of the First Path.


Thus they were both converted; they confessed their faults one to the other, and asked forgiveness; peaceful and harmonious, they were at one together. That very same day they ate together in the presence of the Fortunate One.


His meal over, the Teacher returned to the monastery. They both returned with him, bearing a rich present of flowers, scents and perfumes, of ghee, honey, and sugar. The Teacher, having preached of duty before the Saá¹gha, and uttered a Sugataâs discourse, retired to his scented chamber.


Next morning, the monks talked the matter over in the Dhamma Hall. âFriend,â one would say to another, âour Teacher subdues the unsubdued. Why, here are these two grand persons, who have been quarrelling all this time, and could not be reconciled by the king himself, or friends and kinsfolk: and the TathÄgata has humbled them in a single day!â The Teacher came in, âWhat are you talking about,â asked he, âas you sit here together?â

Here, as before, the Teacher said: âThis is not the first time, monks, these two nobles have been reconciled by me; in former times I reconciled them too.â Then he told a story of the past.

Womb-born one, having made peace with your enemy, the egg-born one, you sleep with your teeth uncovered, what is it you have come to fear?

Make agreements with enemies, do not have confidence in friends, a fear arising from what is not fearful cuts off all the roots. 
{2.54}

Then this lesson ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka, âThe two noblemen were at that time snake and mongoose, and I was myself the ascetic.â

## Full Story
âFourteen thousand UpasÄá¸·has.â
 This story the Teacher told while at Jetavana, about a brahmin named UpasÄá¸·ha, who was fastidious in the matter of cemeteries.


This man, we learn, was rich and wealthy; but, though he lived over against the monastery, he showed no kindness to the Buddhas, being given to heresy. But he had a son, wise and intelligent. When he was growing old, the man said to his son, âDonât let my body be burnt in a cemetery where any outcaste can be burnt, but find some uncontaminated place to burn me in.â âFather,â said the young fellow, âI know no cemetery fit to burn your body in. My father, take the lead and point out the place where I shall have you burnt.â So the brahmin consenting led his son out of the city to the top of Vulture Peak, and then said he, âHere, my son, no outcaste is ever burnt; here I would have you burn me.â Then he began to descend the hill in his sonâs company.


On that day, in the evening, the Teacher was looking around to see which of his friends was ripe for release, and perceived that this father and son were 
[2.38]
 ready to enter upon the First Path. So he took their road, and came to the foot of the hill, like a hunter waiting for his quarry; there he sat till they should come down from the top. Down they came, and noticed the Teacher. He gave them greeting, and asked, âWhere are you bound, brahmins?â The young man told him their errand. âCome along, then,â said the Teacher, âshow me the place your father pointed out.â So he and they two together climbed up the mountain. âWhich place?â he asked. âSir,â said the lad, âthe space between these three hills is the one he showed me.â 
{2.55}
 The Teacher said: âThis is not the first time, my lad, that your father has been nice in the matter of cemeteries; he was the same before. Nor is it only now that he has pointed you out this place for his burning; long ago he pointed out the very same place.â And at his request the Teacher told them a tale of long ago.

There are fourteen thousand people named UpasÄá¸·aka who were burned in this place, there is no place on earth unaffected by death.

In whom there is truth, Dhamma, non-violence, restraint, and self-control, the noble keep company there, on earth thatâs unaffected by death. 
[2.39]

When this discourse was ended, the Teacher declared the Truths and identified the JÄtaka, at the conclusion of the Truths father and son were established in the Fruit of the First Path. âThe father and son were the same then as they are now, and the ascetic was I myself.â

âBegging monk, do you know.â
 This story was told by the Teacher while he was staying in Tapoda Park near RÄjagaha, about elder Samiddhi [Goodluck].


Once venerable Samiddhi had been wrestling in the spirit all night long. At sunrise he bathed; then he stood with his under garment on, holding the other in his hand, as he dried his body, all yellow as gold. Like a golden statue of exquisite workmanship he was, the perfection of beauty; 
{2.57}
 and that is why he was called Samiddhi.


A DevadhÄ«tÄ, seeing the elderâs surpassing beauty, fell in love with him, and addressed him thus. âYou are young, monk, and fresh, a mere stripling, with black hair, bless you! You have youth, you are lovely and pleasant to the eyes. Why should a man like you turn ascetic without a little enjoyment? Take your pleasure first, and then you shall become ascetic and do what the ascetics do!â He replied, âNymph, at some time or other I must die, and the time of my death I know not; that time is hid from me. Therefore in the freshness of my youth I will follow the solitary life, and make an end of suffering.â


Finding she received no encouragement, the DevadhÄ«tÄ at once vanished. The elder went and told his Teacher about it. Then the Teacher said: âNot now alone, Samiddhi, are you tempted by a DevadhÄ«tÄ. In olden days, as now, DevadhÄ«tÄ tempted ascetics.â And then at his request the Teacher told a story of the past.

Without enjoying you seek alms, monk, donât seek alms without enjoying, having enjoyed, monk, you must seek alms, do not let time pass you by. 
{2.58}

I do not know the time, the time is hidden, and not visible, so, without enjoying, I seek alms, and donât let time pass me by.

After this discourse the Teacher identified the JÄtaka, âThe DevadhÄ«tÄ is the same in both stories, and the ascetic at that time was I myself.â

 This story the Teacher told at Jetavana, about his meaning in the Discourse about the Bird Preaching.

One day the Teacher called the monks, saying: âWhen you seek alms, monks, keep each to your own district.â And repeating that Discourse from the MahÄvagga which suited the occasion, 
{2.59}
 he added, âBut wait a moment: previously others even in the form of animals refused to keep to their own

 districts, and by poaching on other peopleâs preserves, they fell into the way of their enemies, and then by their own intelligence and resource got free from the hands of their enemies.â With these words he related a story of the past.

When this tale had been told, the Teacher added, âThus you see, monks, how even animals fall into their enemiesâ hands by leaving their proper place; but when they keep to it, they conquer their enemies. Therefore do you take care not to leave your own place and intrude upon anotherâs. O monks, when people leave their own station MÄra

The passage is corrupt. We must read â

 This, monks, is the wrong place for a monk.â Then growing perfectly enlightened he repeated the first verse:

A hawk diving with force on a quail standing in its pasture grounds, swooped down on him with violence, and came to death because of that. 
[2.42]

When he had thus perished, out came the quail, exclaiming, âI have seen the back of my enemy!â and perching upon his enemyâs breast, he gave voice to his exalted utterance in the words of the second verse:

Having succeeded with my plan, I delight in my fathersâ grounds, now rid of my foe I rejoice, considering my own welfare.

This discourse at an end, the Teacher declared the Truths and identified the JÄtaka. At the conclusion of the Truths many monks were established in the Paths or their Fruition, âDevadatta was the falcon of those days, and the quail was I myself.â

Happy he sleeps and happy he awakes; he sees no bad dreams; men love him; Amanussas guard him; fire, poison, and sword come not near him; quickly he becomes absorbed in mind; his look grows calm; he dies undismayed; without need of further wisdom he goes to Brahmaâs Realm. Loving-kindness, monks, practised with renunciation of oneâs wishesâ and so forth, âmay be expected to produce these Eleven Blessings. Praising the loving-kindness which holds these Eleven Blessings, monks, a monk ought to show kindness to all creatures, whether expressly commanded or not, he should be a friend to the friendly, aye a friend to the unfriendly, and a friend to the indifferent: thus to all without distinction, whether expressly bidden or not, he should show loving-kindness: he should show sympathy with joy and sorrow and practise equanimity; he should do his work by means of the four Divine Abidings. By so doing he will go to Brahmaâs Realm even without Path or Fruit. Wise men of old by cultivating loving-kindness for seven years, have dwelt in Brahmaâs Realm seven ages, each with its one period to wax and one to wane.â

One day he set out to listen to the Teacher at Jetavana, bearing plenteous ghee and condiments of all sorts, flowers, perfumes, etc. At the same time, his wifeâs mother started to visit her daughter, and brought a present of solid food and gruel. She was a little hard of hearing.


After dinner â one feels a little drowsy after a meal â she said, by way of keeping herself awake, âWell, and does your husband live happily with you? Do you agree together?â âWhy, mother, what a thing to ask! You could hardly find a holy ascetic who is so good and virtuous as he!â The good woman did not quite take in what her daughter said, but she caught the word, âAsceticâ and cried she, âO dear, why has your husband turned ascetic!â and a great to-do she made. Everybody who lived in that house heard it, and cried, âNews â the householder has turned ascetic!â People heard the noise, and a crowd gathered at the door to find out what it was. âThe householder who lives here has turned ascetic!â was all they heard.


Our householder listened to the One with Ten Powerâs sermon, then left the monastery to return to the city. Midway a man met him, who cried, âWhy, master, they do say youâve turned ascetic, and all your family and servants are crying at home!â 
{2.64}
 Then these thoughts passed through his mind. âPeople say I have turned ascetic when I have done nothing of the kind. A lucky speech must not be neglected; this day an ascetic I must be.â Then and there he turned right round, and went back to the Teacher. âYou paid your visit to the Buddha,â the Teacher said, âand went away. What brings you back here again?â The man told him about it, adding, âA lucky speech, sir, must not be neglected. So here I am, and I wish to become an ascetic.â Then he received the lesser and the greater orders, and lived a good life; and very soon he became an Arahat.


The story got known amongst the Saá¹gha. One day they were discussing it all together in the Dhamma Hall, on this fashion, âI say, friend, householder So-and-so took orders because he said âa lucky speech must never be neglected,â and now he has became an Arahat!â The Teacher came in and wanted to know what it was they were talking about. They told him. Said he, âMonks, wise men in days long past also went forth because they said that a lucky speech must never be neglected,â and then he told them a story of olden days.

âVirtuous One,â O leader of men, when people here reach agreement on this name, then the wise man must not fall away, through conscience they bear their duty and so on.

This agreement is reached here today, here, O leader of men, âVirtuous One,â I consider here whether to go forth, for me here thereâs no will for sense pleasure.

The Teacher, having ended this discourse, identified the JÄtaka, âÄnanda was king in those days, and I myself was the rich Benares merchant.â

## Analysis
In the present KokÄlika wanted to be one of those who recited the scriptures, and was invited to do so, but when he appeared in front of the Saá¹gha he could not remember one verse. The Buddha tells a story of a jackal who joined in with lions when they roared and was scorned for his vanity.

## Full Story
âWho is it with a mighty cry.â
 This is a story which the Teacher told at Jetavana about one KokÄlika. At this time we hear that there were a number of very learned monks in the district of ManosilÄ, who spoke out like young lions, loud enough to bring down the heavenly Ganges, 
The Milky Way. See the 
Story of the Present
 to No. 1, above.
 
{2.66}
 while reciting passages of scripture before the Saá¹gha. As they recited their texts, KokÄlika (not knowing what an empty fool he showed himself) thought he would like to do the same. So he went about among the monks saying: âThey donât ask me to recite a piece of scripture. If 
[2.46]
 they were to ask me, I would do it.â All the Saá¹gha got to know of it and they thought they would try him. âFriend KokÄlika,â they said, âgive the Saá¹gha a recital of some scriptures today.â To this he agreed, not knowing his folly; that day he would recite before the Saá¹gha.


He first partook of gruel made to his liking, ate some food, and had some of his favourite soup. At sundown the gong sounded for sermon time; all the Saá¹gha gathered together. The âyellow robeâ which he put on was blue as a bluebell; his outer robe was pure white. Thus clad, he entered the meeting, greeted the elders, stepped up to a Dhamma Seat under a grand jewelled pavilion, holding an elegantly carved fan, and sat down, ready to begin his recitation. But just at that moment beads of sweat began to start out all over him, and he felt ashamed. The first verse of the first verse he repeated; but what came next he could not think. So rising from the seat in confusion, he passed out through the meeting, and sought his own cell. Someone else, a real scholar, recited the scripture. After that all the monks knew how empty he was.


One day the monks fell a talking of it in the Dhamma Hall, âFriend, it was not easy to see formerly how empty KokÄlika is; but now he has given tongue of his own accord, and shown it.â The Teacher entered, and asked what they were discussing together. They told him. He said: âMonks, this is not the first time KokÄlika has betrayed himself by his voice; the very same thing happened before,â and then he told them a story.

Who is it, with a great noise, that resounds on the mount Daddara. The lions no longer cry out, what is his name, lord of the beasts?

The jackal, my dear, the meanest who lives amongst those born as beasts, completely disgusted by his kind, the lions sit in silence.

âMonks,â the Teacher added, â âtis not the first time KokÄlika has betrayed himself by his voice; it was just the same before,â and bringing his discourse to an end, he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time KokÄlika was the jackal, RÄhula was the young lion, and I was myself the lion king.â

This story the Teacher told, while dwelling in Jetavana, about a dishonest monk. This man, even though dedicated to the dispensation that leads to safety, notwithstanding to gain lifeâs necessaries fulfilled the threefold cheating practice [seeking requisites, seeking honour and hinting].


The monks brought to light all the evil parts in the man as they conversed together in the Dhamma Hall, âSuch a one, monks, after he had dedicated himself to this dispensation which leads to safety, yet lives in deceit!â The Teacher came in, and would know what they talked of there. They told him.

Here too the Teacher said: âMonks, not this once only has the fellow turned out a rogue; in days of yore, when he was a monkey, he played tricks for the sake of a fire.â And he told a tale of days long gone by.

Father, this is a young brahmin, reclining at a palm treeâs root, here there is a small hut, come now, let us give the small hut to him. 
[2.48]

Dearest, I do not reproach you, but he would befoul our small hut, a face of such a type was never a virtuous brahminâs face.

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he identified the JÄtaka, âThis tricky monk was the monkey of those days; RÄhula 
Gotama Buddhaâs son.
 was the asceticâs son, and I myself was the ascetic.â

He was just the same before.â Then he told them a story.

I have given you plenty of water, when you were scorched by heat, and were thirsty. Now, having drunk, you are chattering away, itâs best to be detached from bad people.

Whoever heard or saw what is known as a virtuous monkey? Now I have defecated on you, this is our normal custom.

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, after saying: âIt is not only now that Devadatta is so, but in former days also he would not acknowledge a kindness which I showed him,â he identified the JÄtaka, âDevadatta was the monkey then, and the brahmin was I myself.â

One rainy season, disaffection broke out on his borders. The troops stationed there, after two or three battles in which they failed to conquer their adversaries, sent a message to the king. In spite of the season, in spite of the rains, he took the field, and encamped before Jetavana. Then he began to ponder. â âTis a bad season for an expedition; every crevice and hollow is full of water; the road is heavy: Iâll go visit the Teacher. He will be sure to ask âwhither away,â then Iâll tell him. It is not only in things of the future life that our Teacher protects me, but he protects in the things which we now see. So if my going is not to prosper, he will say âIt is a bad time to go, sire;â but if I am to prosper, he will say nothing.â So into Jetavana he came, and after greeting the Teacher sat down on one side.


âWhence come you, O king,â asked the Teacher, âat this unseasonable hour?â âSir,â he replied, âI am on my way to quell a border rising; and I come first to bid you farewell.â To this the Teacher said: âSo it happened before, that mighty monarchs, before setting out for war, have listened to the word of the wise, and turned back from an unseasonable expedition.â Then, at the kingâs request, he told a story of the past.

The fool, who resorts to the tree branches â leader of men, wisdomâs not found in him â threw away a whole fistful of cow peas, seeking out one cow pea that had fallen.

Such are we, O king, those who live amongst others, having great greed, we lose a lot through a little, like the monkey with the cow pea.

As in the MahÄbodhijÄtaka [Ja 528], and the UmmaggajÄtaka [Ja 538], 
[I include the story above.]
 on hearing his own knowledge praised, he remarked, âNot only is the TathÄgata wise this one time, but he was wise before, and had skill in means,â and he told the following story of the past.

They stand there with quivers in hand, and bows, and bearing noble blades, we are surrounded on all sides, how will there be freedom for us? 
{2.78}

Perhaps, to those with many duties, some benefit may arise, there is some not cut off the tree, eat the fruit of the ebony.

When this discourse came to an end, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka, âMahÄnÄma Sakka was the nephew Senaka of those days; the Buddhaâs followers were the monkey troop; and I myself was their chief.â

 This story the Teacher told in Jetavana, how a man got rid of the plague. 
AhivÄtarogo
 occurs in the comm. on 
TherÄ«gÄthÄ
 (
P. T.S.
 1893), p. 120, line 20, but no hint as to its meaning is given. The word should mean, âsnake-wind-disease,â perhaps malarial fever, which e.g. in the Terai is believed to be due to snakeâs breath. Or is it possible that 
ahi
, which may mean the navel, could here be the bowels, and some such disease as cholera be meant? [CPED lists the disease as bubonic plague, but on what authority I donât know.]


It is said that the plague once broke out in a family of SÄvatthi. The parents said to their son, âDonât stay in this house, son; make a hole in the wall and escape somewhere, and save your life. 
It is noteworthy that here the same means is used to outwit the spirit of disease as is often taken to outwit the ghosts of the dead; who might be supposed to guard the door, but not the parts of the house where there was no outlet.
 Then come back again â in this place a great hoard is buried; dig it up, and restore the family fortunes, and a happy life to you!â The young fellow did as he was bid; he broke through the wall, and made his escape. When his complaint was cured, he returned and dug the treasure up, with which he set up his household.


One day, laden with oil and ghee, clothes and raiment, and other offerings, he repaired to Jetavana, and greeted the Teacher, and took his seat. The Teacher entered into converse with him. âWe hear,â said he, âthat you had the plague in your house. How did you escape it?â He told the Teacher all about it. Said he, âIn days of yore, as now, friend layman, when danger arose, there were people who were too fond of home to leave it, and they perished thereby; while those who were not too fond of it, but departed elsewhere, saved themselves alive.â And then at his request the Teacher told a story about the past.

The place of my birth, where I developed, I lived thus on this mud, And on this mud I will now die, just like one of those who is weak. This, just this, I say, O Bhaggava, do you listen to my word:

Whether in the village or wilds, wherever he finds happiness, although knowing his place of birth and development, a person should live whereâer he can go, not staying when his home is destroyed. 
{2.81}

When the Teacher had made an end, he declared the Truths, and identified the JÄtaka, at the conclusion of the Truths the young man was established in the Fruit of the First Path. He ended by saying: âÄnanda was then the turtle, and the Potter was I myself.â

## Full Story
âWhat a trifle.â
 
[2.57]
 
{2.82}
 This story the Teacher told while sojourning in Jetavana, about the twenty-one unlawful ways of earning a livelihood.


At one time there were a great many monks who used to get a living by being physicians, or runners, doing errands on foot, exchanging alms for alms, 
The offence meant is giving a share of alms on one day, and receiving the like the next day, to save the trouble of seeking alms daily.
 and the like, the twenty-one unlawful callings. All this will be set forth in the SÄketajÄtaka [Ja 237]. 
[The 
JÄtaka
 does not discuss the subject at hand. In Ja 469, the wrong ways are further described as follows: The monks gained their livelihood in the twenty-one unlawful ways; they associated with the nuns, and sons and daughters were born to them; monks forsook the duties of the Saá¹gha, and nuns forsook the duties of nuns, lay brethren and sisters the duties of such, brahmins did no longer the duties of a brahmin: men for the most part followed the ten paths of evil-doing, and as they died thus filled the hosts of all states of suffering.]
 When the Teacher found out that they got their living thus, he said: âNow there are a great many monks who get their living in unlawful ways. Those who get their living thus will not escape birth as Yakkhas or Petas; they will become beasts of burden; they will be born in hell; for their benefit and blessing it is necessary to hold a discourse which bears its own moral clear and plain.â


So he summoned the Saá¹gha together, and said: âMonks, you must not win your necessaries by the one-and-twenty unlawful methods. Food won unlawfully is like a piece of redhot iron, like a deadly poison. These unlawful methods are blamed and rebuked by disciples of all Buddhas and Paccekabuddhas. For those who eat food gained by unlawful means there is no laughter and no joy. Food got in this way, in my dispensation, is like the leavings of a Caá¹á¸Äla. To partake of it, for a disciple of the Dhamma, is like partaking of the leavings of a Caá¹á¸Äla.â And with these words, he told a story about the past.

That is but small leftovers, given to us with difficulty, I am born a northern brahmin, whose food is also high class.

When this story was ended, the Teacher repeated, âJust as the young brahmin, monks, after eating the leavings of a Caá¹á¸Äla, found that neither laughter nor joy was for him, because he had taken improper food; so whosoever has embraced this dispensation, and gains a livelihood by unlawful means, when he eats the food and supports his life in any way that is blamed and disapproved by the Buddha, will find that there is no laughter and no joy for him.â Then, after Fully Awakening, he repeated the second verse:

Thus, disregarding the Dhamma, he who lives without the Dhamma, like Satadhamma, having gained, does not rejoice in what is gained. 
{2.85}

When this discourse was concluded, the Teacher declared the Truths and identified the JÄtaka, at the conclusion of the Truths many monks entered upon the Paths and the Fruit thereof, saying: âAt the time of the story I was the low-caste man.â

[2.59]
 This story the Teacher told while in Jetavana, about alms given in common. Two friends at SÄvatthi, young men of good position, made a collection, providing all the necessaries to give the Buddha and his followers. They invited them all, provided bounty for seven days, and on the seventh presented them with all their requisites. The eldest of these saluted the Teacher, and said, sitting beside him, âSir, amongst the givers some gave much and some gave little; but let it bear much fruit for all alike.â Then he offered the gift. The Teacherâs reply was, âIn giving these things to the Buddha and his followers, you, my lay friends, have done a great deed. In days of old wise men gave their bounty thus, and thus offered their gifts.â Then at his request he told a story.

Itâs hard to give offerings, itâs hard for one doing a good deed, the bad cannot imitate the good Dhamma which is hard to know.

Therefore the good and bad go from here to different destinies, the bad will surely go to hell, the good cross over to heaven.

When this discourse came to an end the Teacher identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time,â said he, âthe Buddhaâs company was the body of ascetics, and I myself was their leader.â

 This story the Teacher told at Jetavana, about the Great Renunciation. The Teacher said: âNot now alone, monks, has the TathÄgata made the Great Renunciation: in other days he also renounced the white parasol of royalty, and did the same.â And he told a story of the past. 
{2.87}

The archer Asadisa was a prince and he was very strong, one who could shoot far, who was a sharp shooter, breaking great bodies.

Troubling all his enemies, without harassing anyone else, securing the safety of his brothers, he agreed to restraint.

In the present Elder Nanda is lax in effort, thinking of his former love. The Buddha promises him a reward much greater than his fiancee, and he decides to strive harder. The other monks, though, scorn him for having such lowly ends, and he makes even greater effort and attains Awakening. The Buddha tells a story about an elephant who was scared of war, but when advised by his trainer, won a kingdom.

## Full Story
âO elephant, a hero you.â
 This story the Teacher told while staying at Jetavana, about elder Nanda.


The Teacher, on his first return to Kapila city, had received into the Saá¹gha prince Nanda, his younger brother, and returned to SÄvatthi after and stayed there. Now Elder Nanda, as he was leaving his home, after taking the bowl, in the TathÄgataâs company, remembered how JanapadakalyÄá¹Ä« was looking out of a window, with her hair half combed, and she said: âWhy, prince Nanda is off with the Teacher! â Come back soon, dear lord!â remembering this, I say, he grew downcast and despondent, yellower and yellower, and the veins stood knotted over his skin.


When the Teacher learned, of this, he thought: âWhat if I could establish Nanda as an Arahat!â To Nandaâs cell he went, and sat on the seat which was offered him. âWell, Nanda,â he asked, âare you content with our dispensation?â âSir,â replied Nanda, âI am in love with JanapadakalyÄá¹Ä«, and I am not content.â âHave you been on pilgrimage in the HimÄlayas, Nanda?â âNo, sir, not yet.â âThen we will go.â âBut, sir, I have no Supernormal Powers; how can I go?â âI will take you, Nanda.â So saying, the Teacher took him by the hand, and thus passed through the air.


On the way they passed over a burnt field. There, upon the charred stump of a tree, with nose and tail half gone, hair scorched off, and her hide a cinder, nothing but skin, all covered with blood, sat a female monkey. âDo you see that monkey, Nanda?â the Teacher asked. âYes, sir.â âTake a good look at her,â said he. Then he pointed out, stretching over sixty leagues, the uplands of ManosilÄ, the seven great lakes, Anotatta and the rest, the five great rivers, the whole HimÄlaya highlands, with the magnificent hills named of Gold, of Silver, and of Gems, and hundreds of other lovely spots. Next he asked, âNanda, have you ever seen the abode of the Thirty-Three?â 
{2.93}
 âNo, sir, never,â was the reply. âCome along, Nanda,â said he, âand I will show you the abode of the Thirty-Three.â


Therewith he brought him to the Yellowstone Throne, 
The throne of Sakka (Indra).
 and made him sit on it. Sakka, King of the Devas in two heavens, came with his host 
[2.64]
 of gods, gave greeting and sat down on one side. His handmaids to the number of twenty-five million, and five hundred AccharÄ with dovesâ feet, came and made greeting, then sat down on one side. The Teacher made Nanda look at these five hundred AccharÄ again and again, with desire after them. âNandaâ said he, âdo you see these dove-footed AccharÄ? âYes, sir.â âWell, which is prettier â they or JanapadakalyÄá¹Ä«?â âOh, sir! As that wretched ape was in comparison with JanapadakalyÄá¹Ä«, so is she compared with these!â âWell, Nanda, what are you going to do?â âHow is it possible, sir, to win these nymphs?â âBy living as an ascetic, sir,â said the Teacher, âone may win these nymphs.â The lad said: âIf the Fortunate One pledges his word that an ascetic life will win these nymphs, an ascetic life I will lead.â âAgreed, Nanda, I pledge my word. Well, sir,â said he, âdonât let us make a long business of it. Let us be off, and I will become an ascetic.â


The Teacher brought him to Jetavana back again. The elder began to follow the ascetic life.


The Teacher recounted to SÄriputta, the Captain of the Dhamma, how his younger brother had made him pledge himself in the midst of the gods in the heaven of the Thirty-Three about the DevaccharÄ. In the same manner, he told the story to elder MahÄmoggallÄna, to elder MahÄkassapa, to elder Anuruddha, to elder Änanda, the Treasurer of the Dhamma, eighty great disciples in all; and then, one after the other, he told it to the other monks.


The Captain of the Dhamma, elder SÄriputta, asked elder Nanda, âIs it true, as I hear, friend, that you have the One with Ten Powersâ pledged word that you shall win the DevaccharÄ in the heaven of the Thirty-Three, by passing your life as an ascetic? Then,â he went on, âis not your holy life all bound up with womankind and lust? If you live chaste just for the sake of women, what is the difference between you and a labourer who works for hire?â 
{2.94}
 This saying quenched all the fire in him and made him ashamed of himself. In the same way all the eighty chief disciples, and all the rest of the monks, made this worthy monk ashamed. âI have been wrong,â thought he; in all shame and remorse, he got up his courage, and set to work to develop his spiritual insight. Soon he became an Arahat. He came to the Teacher, and said: âSir, I release the Fortunate One from his promise.â The Teacher said: âIf you have become an Arahat, Nanda, I am thereby released from my promise.â


When the monks heard of this, they began to talk about it over in their Dhamma Hall. âHow docile that elder Nanda is, to be sure! Why, friend, one word of advice awakened his sense of shame; at once he began to live as an ascetic and now he is an Arahat!â The Teacher came in, and asked what they were talking about together. They told him. âMonks,â said he, âNanda was just as docile in former days as he is now,â and then he told them a story.

Accustomed to battle, the hero is renowned as being strong, why have you returned after assaulting the gateway, elephant?

Quickly trample down the cross-bar, and you must pull out the pillars, having crushed the gateways, you must enter quickly, O elephant.

When the Teacher had finished this discourse, he identified the JÄtaka, âIn those days Nanda was the elephant, Änanda was the king, and the trainer was I myself.â

âThis sorry draught.â
 This story the Teacher told while at Jetavana, about five hundred persons who ate leftovers.


At SÄvatthi, we learn, were five hundred persons who had left the stumbling-block of a worldly life to their sons and daughters, 
{2.96}
 and lived all listening to the Teacherâs teaching. Of these, some were in the First Path, some in the Second, some in the Third, all had embraced this dispensation. They that invited the Teacher invited these also. But they had five hundred attendants waiting upon them, to bring them toothbrushes, mouth-water, and garlands of flowers; these lads used to eat their leftovers. After their meal, and a nap, they used to run down to the AciravatÄ«, and on the river bank they would wrestle like very Mallians, 
The Mallians were a tribe of professional wrestlers.
 shouting all the time. But the five hundred lay brethren were quiet, made very little noise, courted solitude. 
[2.66]


The Teacher happened to hear the attendants shouting. âWhat is that noise, Änanda?â he asked. âThe attendants, who eat the leftovers,â was the reply. The Teacher said: âÄnanda, this is not the only time these attendants have fed on leftovers, and made a great noise after it; they used to do the same in the olden days; and then too these lay brethren were just as quiet as they are now.â So saying, at his request, the Teacher told a story of the past.

This fibrous water, tasteless, inferior, drinking it, the donkeys became tipsy. Whereas after drinking this fine liquor the thoroughbreds did not become tipsy.

Having drunk just a little the low man taking it becomes drunk, leader of men. The patient one, born in good family, drinking the finest drink doesnât get drunk.

When this discourse was ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka as follows, âAt that time these attendants were the five hundred asses, these lay brethren were the five hundred thoroughbreds, Änanda was the king, and the wise courtier was I myself.â

âThanks to the groom.â
 
{2.98}
 This story the Teacher told while staying in Veá¸·uvana Park, about keeping bad company. The circumstances have already been recounted under the MahilÄmukhajÄtaka [Ja 26].

This story was told by the Teacher while at the Bamboo Grove, about Devadatta, who, having secured the adherence of prince AjÄtasattu, had attained both gain and honour. Prince AjÄtasattu had a monastery built for Devadatta at GayÄsÄ«sa, and every day brought to him five hundred pots of perfumed three-year-old rice flavoured with all the choicest flavourings. All this gain and honour brought Devadatta a great following, with whom Devadatta lived on, without ever stirring out of his monastery.


At that time there were living in RÄjagaha two friends, of whom one had taken the vows under the Teacher, while the other had taken them under Devadatta. And these continued to see one another, either casually or by visiting the monasteries. Now one day the disciple of Devadatta said to the other, âSir, why do you daily go round for alms with the sweat streaming off you? Devadatta sits quietly at GayÄsÄ«sa and feeds on the best of fare, flavoured with all the choicest flavourings. Thereâs no way like his. Why create misery for yourself? Why should it not be a good thing for you to come the first thing in the morning to the monastery at GayÄsÄ«sa and there drink our rice-gruel with a relish after it, try our eighteen kinds of solid victuals, and enjoy our excellent soft food, flavoured with all the choicest flavourings?â


Being pressed time after time to accept the invitation, the other began to want to go, and thenceforth used to go to GayÄsÄ«sa and there eat and eat, not forgetting however to return to the Bamboo Grove at the proper hour. Nevertheless he could not keep it secret always; and in a little while it came out that he used to go to GayÄsÄ«sa and there regale himself with the food provided for Devadatta. Accordingly, his friends asked him, saying: âIs it true, as they say, that you regale yourself on the food provided for Devadatta?â âWho said that?â said he. âSo-and-so said it.â âIt is true, sirs, that I go to GayÄsÄ«sa and eat there. But it is not Devadatta who gives me food; others do that.â âSir, Devadatta is the foe of the Buddhas; in his wickedness, he has secured the adherence of AjÄtasattu and by unrighteousness got gain and honour for himself. Yet you who have taken the vows according to this dispensation which leads to safety, eat the food which Devadatta gets by unrighteousness. Come; let us bring you before the Teacher.â And, taking with them the monk, they went to the Dhamma Hall.


When the Teacher became aware of their presence, he said: âMonks, are you bringing this monk here against his will?â âYes, sir; this monk, after taking the vows under you, eats the food which Devadatta gets by unrighteousness.â âIs it true, as they say, that you eat the food which Devadatta gets by unrighteousness?â âIt was not Devadatta, sir, that gave it me, but others.â âRaise no quibbles here, monk,â said the Teacher. âDevadatta is a man of bad conduct and bad principle. Oh, how could you, who have taken the vows in the Buddhaâs dispensation, eat Devadattaâs food, while living in the Teacherâs presence? But you have always been prone to being led away, and have followed in turn every one you meet.â

Again, as before, the Teacher said: âIn former days this monk kept bad company just as he does now.â Then he told a story of the past.

Corrupted by Giridatta, king SÄmaâs horse called Paá¹á¸ava, abandoning his previous nature, he follows his trainer. 
[2.68]

If a man, a kinsman, provided with a good disposition, having taken him by the bit, guides him around the enclosure, quickly abandoning his limping, he follows the trainer.

The Teacher, when this discourse was ended, identified the JÄtaka, âDevadatta was Giridanta in those days; the monk who keeps bad company was the horse; and the wise counsellor was I myself.â

âThick, muddy water.â
 This story the Teacher told while staying in Jetavana, and it was about a young brahmin.


A young brahmin, as they say, belonging to SÄvatthi, had mastered the Three Vedas, and used to teach the mantras to a number of young brahmins and nobles. In time he settled down as a married man. His thoughts being now busy with wealth and ornaments, serving men and serving women, lands and substance, kine and buffaloes, sons and daughters, he became subject to passion, error and folly. This obscured his wits, so that he forgot how to repeat his mantras in due order, and every now and then the charms did not come clear in his mind.


This man one day procured a quantity of flowers and sweet scents, and these he took to the Teacher in Jetavana. After his greeting, he sat down on one side. 
{2.100}
 The Teacher talked pleasantly to him. âWell, young sir, you are a teacher of the mantras. Do you know them all by heart?â âWell, sir, I used to know them all right, but since I married my mind has been darkened, and I donât know them any longer.â âAh, young sir,â the Teacher said, âjust the same happened before; at first your mind was clear, and you knew all your verses perfectly, but when your mind was obscured by passions and sensual desires, you could no longer clearly see them.â Then at his request the Teacher told the following story.

Just as in agitated and disturbed water, one cannot see oyster shells or other shellfish, pebbles, sand and schools of fish, so in an agitated mind, one does not see oneâs own or anotherâs welfare.

Just as in transparent and undisturbed water, one can see oysters and also other shellfish, pebbles, sand and schools of fish, 
{2.101}
 so in an unagitated mind, one sees oneâs own welfare and anotherâs welfare

When the Teacher had finished this discourse, he declared the Truths, and identified the JÄtaka, at the conclusion of the Truths the young brahmin entered upon the Fruit of the First Path, âIn those days, this youth was the young brahmin, and I was his teacher.â

This story was told by the Teacher while at the Bamboo Grove, about Devadatta, who, having secured the adherence of prince AjÄtasattu, had attained both gain and honour.

Accordingly, his friends asked him, saying: âIs it true, as they say, that you regale yourself on the food provided for Devadatta?â âWho said that?â said he. âSo-and-so said it.â âIt is true, sirs, that I go to GayÄsÄ«sa and eat there. But it is not Devadatta who gives me food; others do that.â âSir, Devadatta is the foe of the Buddhas; in his wickedness, he has secured the adherence of AjÄtasattu and by unrighteousness got gain and honour for himself. Yet you who have taken the vows according to this dispensation which leads to safety, eat the food which Devadatta gets by unrighteousness.

Oh, how could you, who have taken the vows in the Buddhaâs dispensation, eat Devadattaâs food, while living in the Teacherâs presence? But you have always been prone to being led away, and have followed in turn every one you meet.â

Again the Teacher said: âMonks, bad 
[2.70]
 company is evil and injurious; why should one talk of the evil effects of bad company on human beings? In days long gone by, even a vegetable, a mango tree, whose sweet fruit was a dish fit for the gods, turned sour and bitter through the influence of a noisome and bitter nimb tree.â Then he told a story.

This mango was previously endowed with colour, fragrance, taste, was received with honour, why is this mango now a bitter fruit?

DadhivÄhana, your mango is surrounded by nimba trees, the roots are mixed up with roots, the branches are entwined with branches, through association with the bad the mango has bitter fruit.

After this discourse was ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka, âIn those days I was the wise counsellor.â

âLionâs claws and lionâs paws.â
 
[2.75]
 This is a story told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about KokÄlika. They say that KokÄlika one day hearing a number of wise monks preaching, desired to preach himself; all the rest is like the circumstances given in a previous tale. 
No. 172; compare no. 189. KokÄlika is often alluded to in this way; cp. nos. 117, 481. There is a story in the 
Cullavagga
 i. 18. 3, turning on a similar point; a hen has a chick by a crow, and when it would cry cock-a-doodle-doo it caws, and 
vice versa
 (
Vinaya Texts
, 
Sacred Books of the East
, ii. p. 362). [I include KokÄlikaâs story here.]

At this time we hear that there were a number of very learned monks in the district of ManosilÄ, who spoke out like young lions, loud enough to bring down the heavenly Ganges, while reciting passages of scripture before the Saá¹gha. As they recited their texts, KokÄlika (not knowing what an empty fool he showed himself) thought he would like to do the same. So he went about among the monks saying: âThey donât ask me to recite a piece of scripture. If they were to ask me, I would do it.â All the Saá¹gha got to know of it and they thought they would try him. âFriend KokÄlika,â they said, âgive the Saá¹gha a recital of some scriptures today.â To this he agreed, not knowing his folly; that day he would recite before the Saá¹gha.


He first partook of gruel made to his liking, ate some food, and had some of his favourite soup. At sundown the gong sounded for sermon time; all the Saá¹gha gathered together. The âyellow robeâ which he put on was blue as a bluebell; his outer robe was pure white. Thus clad, he entered the meeting, greeted the elders, stepped up to a Dhamma Seat under a grand jewelled pavilion, holding an elegantly carved fan, and sat down, ready to begin his recitation. But just at that moment beads of sweat began to start out all over him, and he felt ashamed. The first verse of the first verse he repeated; but what came next he could not think. So rising from the seat in confusion, he passed out through the meeting, and sought his own cell. Someone else, a real scholar, recited the scripture. After that all the monks knew how empty he was.


One day the monks fell a talking of it in the Dhamma Hall, âFriend, it was not easy to see formerly how empty KokÄlika is; but now he has given tongue of his own accord, and shown it.â The Teacher entered, and asked what they were discussing together. They told him.

This time again the Teacher on hearing of it said: âNot this once only has KokÄlika been shown up for what he was worth by means of his own voice; the very same thing happened before.â And he told a story.

Lionâs toes, lionâs claws, you stand on lionâs feet, but this lion makes sound other than lionâs pride. 
{2.109}

Do not cry out, prince, live quietly in the woods, they know by the voice, this is not your fatherâs voice.

When the Teacher had finished this discourse, he identified the JÄtaka, âIn those days KokÄlika was the jackal, RÄhula was the brother cub, and the king of beasts was I myself.â

This time he wanted to intone. The Teacher on hearing of it told the following story.

This is not a lionâs sound, nor is it a tigerâs or leopardâs, but wrapped with a lionâs skin, a contemptible donkey cries out.

For a long time the donkey may have eaten grass and barley, while covered with a lionskin, but he spoiled it all by braying. 
[2.77]

After this discourse was ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time KokÄlika was the ass, and the wise farmer was I myself.â

## Full Story
âBehold the fruit of sacrifice.â
 
{2.111}
 This story the Teacher told while staying in Jetavana, about a believing layman. This was a faithful, pious soul, an elect disciple. One evening, on his way to Jetavana, he came to the bank of the river AciravatÄ«, when the ferrymen had pulled up their boat on the shore in order to attend service; as no boat could be seen at the landing-stage, and our friendâs mind being full of delightful thoughts of the Buddha, he walked into the river. 
The resemblance to St Peter on the Sea of Galilee is striking.
 His feet did not sink below the water. He got as far as mid-river walking as though he were on dry land; but there he noticed the waves. Then his Absorption subsided, and his feet began to sink. Again he strung himself up to high tension, and walked on over the water. So he arrived at Jetavana, greeted the Teacher, and took a seat on one side. The Teacher entered into conversation with him pleasantly. âI hope, good layman,â said he, âyou had no mishap on your way.â âOh, sir,â he replied, âon my way I was so absorbed in thoughts of the Buddha that I set foot upon the river; but I walked over it as though it had been dry ground!â âAh, friend layman,â said the Teacher, âyou are not the only one who has kept safe by remembering the virtues of the Buddha. In olden days pious laymen have been shipwrecked in mid-ocean, and saved themselves by remembering the Buddhaâs virtues.â Then, at the manâs request, he told a story of the past.

Behold, this is the fruit of faith, virtue and liberality, a NÄga, in the shape of a ship, conveys the faithful layman.

Associate only with the wise, be intimate with the wise, through living together with the good the barber got to safety. 
{2.113}

The Teacher, after finishing this discourse, declared the Truths and identified the JÄtaka, at the conclusion of the Truths the pious layman entered on the Fruit of the Second Path, âOn that occasion the converted lay brother attained NibbÄna; SÄriputta was the NÄga king, and the sea-spirit was I myself.â

âEven a broken bowstring.â
 
[2.79]
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling in Jetavana, about temptation arising from a former wife. The circumstances will be explained in the Eighth Book, in the IndriyajÄtaka [Ja 423].

The Teacher told this tale while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning temptation by the wife of oneâs former days. The story is that a young man of good family at SÄvatthi heard the Teacherâs preaching, and thinking it impossible to lead a holy life, perfectly complete and pure, as a householder, he determined to become an ascetic in the dispensation which leads to safety and so make an end of misery. So he gave up his house and property to his wife and children, and asked the Teacher to ordain him. The Teacher did so. As he was the junior in his going about for alms with his teachers and instructors, and as the monks were many, he got no chair either in laymenâs houses or in the refectory, but only a stool or a bench at the end of the novices, his food was tossed him hastily on a ladle, he got gruel made of broken lumps of rice, solid food stale or decaying, or sprouts dried and burnt; and this was not enough to keep him alive. He took what he had got to the wife he had left: she took his bowl, saluted him, emptied it and gave him instead well-cooked gruel and rice with sauce and curry.


The monk was captivated by the love of such flavours and could not leave his wife. She thought she would test his affection. One day she had a countryman cleansed with white clay and set down in her house with some others of his people whom she had sent for, and she gave them something to eat and drink. They sat eating and enjoying it. At the house-door she had some bullocks bound to wheels and a cart set ready. She herself sat in a back room cooking cakes. Her husband came and stood at the door. Seeing him, one old servant told his mistress that there was an elder at the door. âSalute him and bid him pass on.â


But though he did so repeatedly, he saw the monk remaining there and told his mistress. She came, and lifting up the curtain to see, she cried, âThis is the father of my sons.â She came out and saluted him: taking his bowl and making him enter she gave him food: when he had eaten she saluted again and said: âSir, you are a saint now: we have been staying in this house all this time; but there can be no proper householderâs life without a master, so we will take another house and go far into the country: be zealous in your good works, and forgive me if I am doing wrong.â For a time her husband was as if his heart would break. Then he said: âI cannot leave you, do not go, I will come back to my worldly life; send a laymanâs garment to such and such a place, I will give up my bowl and robes and come back to you.â She agreed. The monk went to his monastery, and giving up his bowl and robes to his teachers and instructors he explained, in answer to their questions, that he could not leave his wife and was going back to worldly life.


Against his will they took him to the Teacher and told him that he was discontent and wished to go back to worldly life. The Teacher said: âIs this tale true?â âIt is, Lord.â âWho causes you to fall back?â âMy wife.â

Then the Teacher said to this monk, âThat is a woman who does you harm. In former times, too, she put you to the blush before the king and his whole court, and gave you good reason to leave your home.â And he told a story of the past.

Although broken, Ruhaka, the bow string can be reconnected, connect with the old bow string,  do not be controlled by anger. 
{2.115}

While there is fibre existing, while there are workmen existing, I will make another bow string, enough with the old bow string!

The Teacher, after finishing this discourse, declared the Truths and identified the JÄtaka, at the conclusion of the Truths the tempted monk was established in the fruit of the First Path, âOn that occasion the former wife was the same, Ruhaka was the tempted monk, and I was the king of Benares.â

â âTis I â no other.â
 
[2.81]
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana about a discontented monk. The circumstances will be explained in the UmmadantÄ«jÄtaka [Ja 527].

The story tells that one day, as he was going his rounds in SÄvatthi for alms, he saw a woman of surpassing beauty, magnificently attired, and fell in love with her, and on returning home to his monastery he was unable to divert his thoughts from her. From that time, as it were, pierced with loveâs shafts and sick with desire he became as lean as a wild deer, with his veins standing out on his body, and as sallow as sallow could be. He no longer took delight in any one of the Four Postures, or found pleasure in his own thoughts, but giving up all the services due to a teacher he abandoned the use of instruction, inquiry and meditation.


His fellow-monks said: âSir, once you were calm in mind and serene of countenance, but now it is not so. What can be the cause?â they asked. âSirs,â he answered, âI have no pleasure in anything.â Then they bade him be happy, saying: âTo be born [in the time of] a Buddha is a hard matter: so also is the hearing of the True Dhamma, and the attaining to birth as a human being. But you have attained to this, and, yearning to put an end to sorrow, you left your weeping kinsfolk and becoming a believer adopted the ascetic life. Why then do you now fall under the sway of passion? These evil passions are common to all ignorant creatures, from live worms upwards, and such of these passions as are material in their origin, they too are insipid. Desires are full of sorrow and despair: misery in this case ever increases more and more. Desire is like a skeleton or a piece of meat. Desire is like a torch made of a wisp of hay or a light from embers. Desire vanishes like a dream or a loan, or the fruit of a tree. Desire is as biting as a sharp-pointed spear, or as a serpentâs head. But you, verily, after embracing such a Buddhaâs dispensation as this and becoming an ascetic, have now fallen under the sway of such harmful passions.â When by their admonitions they failed to make him grasp their teaching, they brought him before the Teacher in the Dhamma Hall. And when he said: âWhy, monks, have you brought this monk here against his will?â they answered, âThey tell us, he is discontent.â

When this monk was asked by the Teacher whether he were really discontent, he replied that he was. âWho,â said the Teacher, âhas caused you to fall back?â He replied that he had seen a woman dressed up in finery, and overcome by passion he had fallen back. Then the Teacher said: âMonk, womankind are all ungrateful and treacherous; wise men of old were even so stupid as to give the blood from their own right knee for them to drink, and made them presents all their life long, and yet did not win their hearts.â And he told a story of the past. 
{2.116}

This is surely her, I am no other, this one had his hands cut off, no other, what she said was: âHe is my youthful husbandâ, women should be killed, there is no truth in women.

Beat this despicable one with a club, a violent wretch, who goes with othersâ wives. This is a wicked and a faithless wife, while still living cut off her ears and nose! 
{2.121}

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he declared the Truths and identified the JÄtaka, at the conclusion of the Truths the discontented monk entered on the Fruit of the First Path, âIn those days certain elders were the six brothers, the young lady CiÃ±cÄ was the wife, Devadatta was the criminal, Änanda was the iguana, and king Paduma was I myself.â

So he came to Jetavana, and saluted the Teacher; told him how a courtier had intrigued, and asked what he was to do. The Teacher asked him whether he found the courtier useful to him, and whether he loved his wife. âYes,â was the reply, âthe man is very useful; he is the mainstay of my court; and I do love the woman.â âSire,â replied the Teacher, âwhen servants are useful, and women are dear, there is no harming them. In olden days too kings listened to the words of the wise, and were indifferent to such things.â And he told a story of the past.

On a delightful mountain plain arose auspicious lotus lakes, a jackal drank there, knowing that it was guarded by a lion.

If, great king, wild creatures drink from this great pond, because of that it does not stop being a pond, if they are dear to you, be patient.

## Full Story
âThey who will neglect.â
 This story the Teacher told while staying in Jetavana, about a monk who had become discontent.


When the Teacher asked him if it was really true that he was discontent, the monk replied that it was true. Being questioned for the reason, he replied that his passion had been aroused by seeing a finely dressed woman. Then the Teacher thus addressed him:


âMonk, these women tempt men by their figure and voice, scents, perfumes, and touch, and by their wiles and dalliance; thus they get men into their power; and as soon as they perceive that this is done, they ruin them, character, wealth and all, by their evil ways. This gives them the name of Yakkhinis. In former days also a troop of Yakkhinis tempted a caravan of traders, and got power over them; and afterwards, when they got sight of other men, they killed every one of themt, and then devoured them, crunching them in their teeth while the blood ran down over both cheeks.â And then he told a story of the past.

Those people who wonât follow the advice given by the Buddha, will go on to destruction, like the merchants with the Rakkhasis.

Those people who do follow the advice given by the Buddha, will cross over unto safety, like the merchants with the cloud-horse.

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he declared the Truths and identified the JÄtaka, at the conclusion of the Truths the discontented monk entered on the Fruit of the First Path, and many others entered on the Fruit of the First, Second, Third or Fourth, âThe Buddhaâs followers were the two hundred and fifty who followed the advice of the horse, and I was the horse myself.â

âHe smiles not.â
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling at SÄvatthi, about a certain monk.


This monk took a piece of cloth, that had been given to his teacher, feeling confident that if he took it his teacher would not be angry. Then he made a shoe-bag of it, and took his leave. When this teacher asked why he took it, he replied he had felt confident, if he did, that his teacher would not be angry. The teacher flew into a passion, 
{2.131}
 got up and struck him a blow. âWhat confidence is there between you and me?â he asked.


This fact became known among the Saá¹gha. One day the monks were all together talking about it in the Dhamma Hall. âFriend, young monk 
[2.92]
 So-and-so felt so confident of his teacherâs friendship, that he took a piece of cloth, and made it into a shoe-bag. Then the teacher asked him what confidence there was between them, flew into a passion, jumped up, and gave him a blow.â The Teacher came in, and asked them what they were talking of as they sat there together. They told him. Then he said: âThis is not the first time, monks, that this man has disappointed the confidence of his fellow. He did the same before.â And then he told a story of the past.

Having seen you he does not smile, nor does he give you a welcome, he does not give you his attention,  and he speaks out against you.

These are the dispositions that are established in a foe, from which, seeing and hearing, the wise one can know who his foe is. 
{2.132}

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he identified the JÄtaka, âThe monk in question was he who kept the pet elephant, his teacher was the elephant, the Buddhaâs followers were then the band of ascetics, and I myself was their chief.â

 were aroused on seeing a woman in her finery.â Then the Teacher said: âMonk, there is no guarding women. In days of yore, watchers were placed to guard the doors, and yet they could not keep them safe; even when you have got them, you cannot keep them.â And he told a story of the past.

I have come from living abroad, dear, now I came not long ago, I wonder, dear, your mother, does she not consort with another?

[2.96]
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana, about a brahmin.


This man, we are told, had four daughters. Four suitors wooed them; one was fine and handsome, one was old and well advanced in years, the third a man of family, and the fourth was good. He thought to himself, âWhen a man is settling his daughters and disposing of them, whom should he give them to? The handsome man or the oldish man, or one of the other two, the highly born or the very virtuous man?â Ponder as he would, he could not decide. So he thought he would tell the matter to the Supreme Buddha, who would be sure to know; and then he would give the girls to the most suitable wooer. So he had a quantity of perfumes and garlands prepared, and visited the monastery. Saluting the Teacher, he sat on one side, and told him everything from beginning to end; then he asked, âTo which of these four should I give my daughters?â To this the Teacher replied, âIn olden days, as now, wise men asked this question; but now that rebirth has confused your memory, you cannot remember the case.â And then at his request the Teacher told a story of the past.

One is handsome, one is elder, one of good birth, one virtuous, we ask the brahmin about this: which one of these suitors is good? 
{2.138}

There is good in the body, we must pay respects to an elder, there is good in being well born, but in virtue is our delight.

The Teacher, when this discourse was ended, declared the Truths and identified the JÄtaka, at the conclusion of the Truths the brahmin attained the Fruit of the First Path, âThis brahmin was the brahmin then, and the famous teacher was I myself.â

âNot iron fetters.â
 
{2.139}
 This story the Teacher told while staying in Jetavana, about the prison-house.


At the time of this story we hear that a gang of burglars, highwaymen, and murderers had been caught and brought before the king of Kosala. The king ordered them to be made fast with chains, and ropes, and fetters. Thirty country monks, desirous of seeing the Teacher, had paid him a visit and offered their salutations. Next day, as they were seeking alms, they passed the prison and noticed these rascals. In the evening, after their return from the dayâs rounds, they approached the TathÄgata, âSir,â they said, âtoday, as we were seeking alms, we saw in the prison-house a number of criminals bound fast in chains and fetters, being in great misery. They could not break these fetters, and run away. Is there any fetter stronger than these?â


The Teacher replied, âMonks, those are fetters, it is true; but the fetters which consist of a craving for wealth, corn, sons, wives and children are stronger than they are a hundred-fold, nay a thousand-fold. Yet even those fetters, hard to break as they are, have been broken by wise men of old, who went to the HimÄlayas and became ascetics.â Then he told them a story.

There is no bond stronger, so say the wise, whether made of iron, wood, or bulrush, an obsession for jewels and earrings, and the longing towards both sons and wives.

This bond is the stronger, so say the wise, dragging down, pliant, hard to get free from, having cut this also, the wise depart, indifferent, giving up sensual pleasure.
{2.141}

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he declared the Truths: at the conclusion of the Truths, some entered the First Path, some the Second, some the Third, and some the Fourth. âIn the story, MahÄmÄyÄ was the mother, king Suddhodana was the father, RÄhulaâs mother was the wife, RÄhula himself the son, and I was the man who left his family and became an ascetic.â

 {2.142}
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana, about Lakuá¹á¹­aka the venerable and good.


Now this venerable Lakuá¹á¹­aka, we learn, was well known in the dispensation of the Buddha, a famous man, speaking sweet words, a honeyed preacher, having the analytic knowledges, with his passions perfectly subdued, but in stature the smallest of all the eighty elders, no bigger than a novice, like a dwarf kept for amusement.


One day, he had been to the gate of Jetavana to salute the TathÄgata, when thirty brothers from the country arrived at the gate on their way to salute him too. When they saw the elder, they imagined him to be some novice; they pulled the corner of his robe, they caught his hands, held his head, tweaked his nose, got him by the ears and shook him, and handled him very rudely; then 
[2.99]
 after putting aside their bowl and robe, they visited the Teacher and saluted him. Next they asked him, âSir, we understand that you have an elder who goes by the name of Lakuá¹á¹­aka the Good, a honeyed preacher. Where is he?â âDo you want to see him?â the Teacher asked. âYes, sir.â âHe is the man you saw by the gate, and twitched his robe and pulled him about with great rudeness before you came here.â âWhy, sir,â asked they, âhow is it that a man devoted to prayer, full of high aspirations, a true disciple â how is it he is so insignificant?â âBecause of his own defilements,â answered the Teacher; and at their request he told them a story.

This story ended, the Teacher, after Fully Awakening, recited these two couplets:

There are geese, herons, and peacocks, elephants and the spotted deer, all fear the lion, although they are not equal in their bodies.

Even so amongst men a boy is respected if he be wise, but though he is big, a foolâs body is never respected.

When this discourse was ended, the Teacher declared the Truths and identified the JÄtaka, at the conclusion of the Truths some of those monks entered on the First Path, some on the Second, and some upon the Fourth, âThe excellent Lakuá¹á¹­aka was the king in the story, who made people the butt for his jests and then became a butt himself, while I myself was Sakka.â

Said he, âMonks, if our monk had practised loving-kindness towards the four royal races of serpents, that snake would not have bitten him: wise ascetics in by-gone days, before the Buddha was born, by using kindness to these four royal races, were released from the fear that sprang from these serpents.â Then he told them a story.

I am friendly with the VirÅ«pakkhas, with the ErÄpathas I am friendly, I am friendly with the ChabyÄputtas, friendly with the Kaá¹hÄgotamakas.

Iâm friendly with those without feet, with those with two feet Iâm friendly, Iâm friendly with those with four feet, with those with many feet Iâm friendly.

May the one without feet not hurt me, may the one with two feet not hurt me, may the one with four feet not hurt me, may the one with many feet not hurt me.

May all beings, all living creatures, all beings entirely, may all see prosperity, may nothing bad come to anyone.

I have made this protection, I have made this safeguard, may all these beings go away! I revere the Fortunate One, I revere the seven Perfect Sambuddhas.

 sang the praises of their beauty, and went about bragging of it. 
[2.105]


One day they fell into a dispute on this point, âYouâre handsome, but so am I,â said each of them; then, spying an aged elder sitting not far away, they agreed that he was likely to know whether they were handsome or not. Then they approached him with the question, âSir, which of us is handsome?â The elder replied, âFriends, I am more handsome than either of you.â At this the young men reviled him, and went off, grumbling that he told them something they did not ask, but would not tell them what they did.


The Saá¹gha became aware of this event; and one day, when they were all together in the Dhamma Hall, they began talking about it. âFriend, how the old elder shamed those two young fellows whose heads were full of their own beauty!â The Teacher came in, and asked what they were talking of now as they sat together. They told him. He rejoined: âThis, is not the only time, monks, that our friends were full of the praises of their own beauty. In olden times they used to go about boasting of it as they do now.â And then he told them a story.

The Gangesâ fish are lovely, and lovely those of the Yamuna,  this four-footed individual, well-proportioned like a banyan, with a neck like a carriage pole, is more lovely than all of them.

Questioned he does not make answer, or questioned he answers other, that person does praise himself, but our delight is not in this.

When this discourse was concluded, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka, âIn those days the young monks were the two fish, the old man was the turtle, and I was the Tree DevatÄ who saw the whole thing from the Ganges bank.â

âOnce with the great king Assaka.â
 
[2.108]
 This story the Teacher told while staying in Jetavana, about someone who was distracted by the recollection of a former wife. He asked the monk whether he were really lovesick. The man said, Yes. âWhom are you in love with?â the Teacher continued. âMy late wife,â was the reply. Then the Teacher said: âNot this once only, monk, have you been full of desire for this woman; in olden days her love brought you to great misery.â And he told a story.

I wandered around the land together with this king Assaka, reciprocating love with love, having affection for my lord.

Old pleasure and pain are obstructed by the new pleasure and pain, thus now Iâve more affection for a worm than for king Assaka. 
[2.110] {2.158}

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he declared the Truths and identified the JÄtaka, at the conclusion of the Truths, the lovesick monk reached the Fruit of the First Path, âYour late wife was UbbarÄ«; you, the lovesick monk, were king Assaka; SÄriputta was the young brahmin; and the ascetic was I myself.â

Nestor Schnurmann, who heard it from his nurse (about 1860). Once upon a time, the king of the Fishes was wanting in wisdom. His advisers told him that once he could get the heart of the fox, he would become wise. So he sent a deputation, consisting of the great magnates of the sea, whales and others. âOur king wants your advice on some state affairs.â The fox, flattered, consented. A whale took him on his back. On the way the waves beat upon him; at last he asked what they really wanted. They said, what their king really wanted was to eat his heart, by which he hoped to become clever. He said, âWhy didnât you tell me that before? I would gladly sacrifice my life for such a worthy object. But we foxes always leave our hearts at home. Take me back and Iâll fetch it. Otherwise Iâm sure your king will be angry.â So they took him back. As soon as he got near the shore, he leaped on land, and cried âAh you fools! Have you ever heard of an animal not carrying his heart with him?â and ran off. The fish had to return empty.

## Full Story
âMany a tree have I seen.â
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana, about a monk who was one of the fellow-students of elder SÄriputta, Captain of the Dhamma.


This fellow, as we learn, 
{2.161}
 was clever at taking care of his person. Food very hot or very cold he would not eat, for fear it should do him harm. He never went out for fear of being hurt by cold or heat; and he would not have rice which was either over-boiled or too hard.


The Saá¹gha learned how much care he took of himself. In the Dhamma Hall, they all discussed it. âFriend, what a clever fellow monk So-and-so is in knowing what is good for him!â The Teacher came in, and asked what they were talking of as they sat there together. They told him. Then he rejoined,
 [2.113]
 âNot only now is our young friend careful for his personal comfort. He was just the same in olden days.â And he told them a story.

I saw many trees in the woods, like sal trees and myrobalan, but these trees do not walk around like this tree of yours walks around.

This old chicken has departed, having broken out of the cage, the skilful one, departing away from those horse hair snares, speaks out.

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he identified the JÄtaka, âDevadatta was the fowler then, the young dandy was the bird, and the Tree DevatÄ that saw the whole thing was I myself.â

[He also figures in Ja 123 
Naá¹galÄ«sajÄtaka
.]


This man, we learn, was unable to get out a single sound in the presence of two or three people. He was so very nervous, that he said one thing when he meant another.


It happened that the monks were speaking of this as they sat together in the Dhamma Hall. 
{2.165}
 The Teacher came in, and asked what they were talking of as they sat there together. They told him. He answered, âMonks, this is not the first time that LÄá¸·udÄyÄ« has been a very nervous man. It was just the same before.â And he told a story of the past.

You practiced, and were constantly heedful, for a year, in the fragrant grass bushes. You changed the meaning in the assembly, the one of little wisdom did not preserve the sense. 
{2.167}

The one who begs, dear Somadatta, undergoes one of two things: he receives wealth or doesnât receive, this is the nature of asking.

When the Teacher by this story had shown how Simpleton UdÄyÄ« had been just as bashful before as he was then, he identified the JÄtaka, âLÄá¸·udÄyÄ« was the father of Somadatta, and I was Somadatta myself.â

## Full Story
âThe king of Bharu.â
 This story the Teacher told while staying at Jetavana, about the king of Kosala.


Now we read that magnificent presents were made to the Fortunate One and his company, and they were held in great respect, as it is written: âAt that time the Fortunate One was honoured and revered, respected, reverenced, highly esteemed, and received rich presents â robes, food, lodgement, drugs and medicines, and provisions; and the Saá¹gha was honoured, etc. (as before); but the pilgrims of heterodox schools were not honoured, etc. (as before).â 
This appears to be a regular formula; the Sanskrit equivalent occurs in 
DivyÄvadÄna
, p. 91.
 Well, the sectaries, finding that honour and gifts diminished, convened a secret meeting for deliberation. âSince the appearance of the ascetic Gotama,â they said, 
{2.170}
 âhonour and gifts come no more to us, but he has got the best of both. What can be the reason of his good fortune?â Then one of them spoke as follows. âAscetic Gotama has the best and chief place in all JambudÄ«pa to live in, and that is the reason of his success.â Then the others said: âIf this is the reason, we will make a rival settlement above Jetavana, and then we shall receive presents.â This was the conclusion they came to. 
[2.119]


âBut,â thought they, âif we make our settlement unknown to the king, the monks will prevent us. If he accepts a present, he will not be disinclined to break up their settlement. So we had best bribe him to give us a place for ours.â


So by the intervention of his courtiers, they offered a hundred thousand pieces to the king, with this message, âGreat king, we want to make a rival settlement in Jetavana. If the monks tell you they wonât permit it, please do not give them any answer.â To this the king agreed, because he wanted the bribe.


After thus conciliating the king, the schismatics got an architect and put the work in hand. There was a good deal of noise about it.


âWhat is all this great noise and tumult, Änanda?â the Teacher asked. âThe noise,â said he, âis some sectaries who are having a new settlement built.â âThat is not a fit place,â he rejoined, âfor them to settle. These sectaries are fond of noise; thereâs no living with them.â Then he called the Saá¹gha together, and bade them go inform the king, and have the building put a stop to.


The monks went and stood by the palace door. The king, as soon as he heard of their coming, knew they must be come about stopping the new settlement. But he had been bribed, and so he ordered his attendants to say the king was not at home. The monks went back and told the Teacher. The Teacher guessed that a bribe had been given, and sent his two chief disciples. 
SÄriputta and MoggallÄna.
 But the king, as soon as he heard of their coming, gave the same order as before; and they too returned and told the Teacher. The Teacher said: âDoubtless the king is not able to stay at home today; he must be out.â


Next forenoon, he dressed himself, took his bowl and robe, and with five hundred monks walked to the door of the palace. The king heard them come; he descended from the upper story, and took from the Buddha his alms-bowl. Then he gave rice and gruel to him and his followers, and with a salutation sat down on one side.


The Teacher began an exposition for the kingâs benefit, in these words. âGreat king, other kings in by-gone days have taken bribes, and then by making virtuous people quarrel together have been dispossessed of their kingdom, and been utterly destroyed.â And then, at his request, the Teacher told a story of the past. 
{2.171}

Having made the seers differ, the king of Bharu, so I have heard, both the king and his kingdom were cut off and went to destruction. 
[2.121]

Therefore such impulsive behaviour the wise ones do not praise, the one of uncorrupt mind speaks an utterance connected with truth. 
{2.173}

When the Teacher had ended this story, he added, âGreat king, one should not be under the power of desire. Two ascetics ought not to quarrel together.â Then he identified the JÄtaka, âIn those days, I was the leader of the sages.â When the king had entertained the TathÄgata, and he had departed, the king sent some men and had the rival settlement destroyed, and the sectaries became homeless.

The one who drinks when the river is full they say, the one hidden when the barley is grown they say, they call upon him when one has gone far off: well then, brahmin, you must eat and then come to him.

Because the king remembers me, and offers up the crow to me, he will offer geese, herons and peacocks: forgetting would be worse.

âThe turtle needs must speak.â
 
[2.123]
 This is a story told by the Teacher while staying in Jetavana, about KokÄlika. The circumstances which gave rise to it will be set forth under the MahÄtakkÄrijÄtaka [Ja 481].

During one rainy season the two chief disciples, desiring to leave the multitude and to dwell apart, took leave of the Teacher, and went into the kingdom where KokÄlika was. They repaired to the residence of KokÄlika, and said this to him, âMonk KokÄlika, since for us it is delightful to dwell with you, and for you to dwell with us, we would abide here three months.â âHow,â said the other, âwill it be delightful for you to dwell with me?â They answered, âIf you tell not a soul that the two chief disciples are dwelling here, we shall be happy, and that will be our delight in dwelling with you.â âAnd how is it delightful for me to dwell with you?â âWe will teach the Dhamma to you for three months in your home, and we will discourse to you, and that will be your delight in dwelling with us.â âDwell here, monks,â said he, âso long as you will,â and he allotted a pleasant residence to them. There they dwelt in the fruition of the Attainments, and no man knew of their dwelling in that place.


When they had thus past the rains they said to him, âMonk, now we have dwelt with you, and we will go to visit the Teacher,â and asked his leave to go. He agreed, and went with them on the rounds for alms in a village over against the place where they were. After their meal the elders departed from the village. KokÄlika leaving them, turned back and said to the people, âLay brethren, you are like brute animals. Here the two chief disciples have been dwelling for three months in the monastery opposite, and you knew nothing of it: now they are gone.â âWhy did you not tell us, sir?â the people asked.


Then they took ghee and oil and medicines, raiment and clothes, and approached the elders, saluting them and saying: âPardon us, sirs we knew not you were the chief disciples, we have learned it but today by the words of the venerable monk KokÄlika. Pray have compassion on us, and receive these medicines and clothes.â KokÄlika went after the elders with them, for he thought: âThe elders are frugal, and content with little; they will not accept these things, and then they will be given to me.â But the elders, because the gift was offered at the instigation of a monk, neither accepted the things themselves nor had them given to KokÄlika. The lay folk then said: âSirs, if you will not accept these, come here once again to bless us.â The elders promised, and proceeded to the Teacherâs presence.


Now KokÄlika was angry, because the elders neither accepted those things themselves, nor had them given to him. The elders, however, having remained a short while with the Teacher, each chose five hundred monks as their following, and with these thousand monks went on pilgrimage seeking alms, as far as KokÄlikaâs country. The lay folk came out to meet them, and led them to the same monastery, and showed them great honour day by day.


Great was the store given them of clothes and of medicines. Those monks who went out with the elders dividing the garments gave of them to all the monks which had come, but to KokÄlika gave none, neither did the elders give him any. Getting no clothes KokÄlika began to abuse and revile the elders, âSÄriputta and MoggallÄna are full of wicked desire; they would not accept before what was offered them, but these things they do accept. There is no satisfying them, they have no regard for another.â But the elders, perceiving that the man was harbouring evil on their account, set out with their followers to depart; nor would they return, not though the people begged them to stay yet a few days longer.


Then a young monk said: âWhere shall the elders stay, laymen? Your own particular elder does not wish them to stay here.â Then the people went to KokÄlika, and said: âSir, we are told you do not wish the elders to stay here. Go to! Either appease them and bring them back, or away with you and live elsewhere!â In fear of the people this man went and made his request to the elders. âGo back, monk,â answered the elders, âwe will not return.â So he, being unable to prevail upon them, returned to the monastery. Then the lay brethren asked him whether the elders had returned. âI could not persuade them to return,â said he. âWhy not, monk?â they asked. And then they began to think it must be no good monks would dwell there because the man did wrong, and they must get rid of him. âSir,â they said, âdo not stay here; we have nothing here for you.â


Thus dishonoured by them, he took bowl and robe and went to Jetavana. After saluting the Teacher, he said: âSir, SÄriputta and MoggallÄna are full of wicked desire, they are in the power of wicked desires!â The Teacher replied, âSay not so, KokÄlika; let your heart, KokÄlika, have confidence in SÄriputta and MoggallÄna; learn that they are good monks.â KokÄlika said: âYou believe in your two chief disciples, sir; I have seen it with my own eyes; they have wicked desires, they have secrets within them, they are wicked men.â So he said thrice (though the Teacher would have stayed him), then rose from his seat, and departed. Even as he went on his way there arose over all his body boils of the size of a mustard seed, which grew and grew to the size of a ripe seed of the wood apple tree, burst, and blood ran all over him. Groaning he fell by the gate of Jetavana, maddened with pain.


A great cry arose, and reached even to the Brahma Realm, âKokÄlika has reviled the two chief disciples!â Then his spiritual teacher, the Brahma Tudu by name, learning the fact, came with the intent of appeasing the elders, and said while poised in the air, âKokÄlika, a cruel thing this you have done; make your peace with the chief disciples.â âWho are you, brother?â the man asked. âTudu Brahma, is my name,â said he. âHave you not been declared by the Fortunate One,â said the man, âone of those who return not? That word means that such come not back to this earth. You will become a Yakkha upon a dunghill!â Thus he upbraided the MahÄbrahma. And as he could not persuade the man to do as he advised, he replied to him, âMay you be tormented according to your own word.â Then he returned to his abode of bliss. And KokÄlika after dying was born again in the Lotus Hell. That he had been born there the great and mighty Brahma told to the TathÄgata, and the Teacher told it to the monks.


In the Dhamma Hall the monks talked of the manâs wickedness, âMonks, they say KokÄlika reviled SÄriputta and MoggallÄna, and by the words of his own mouth came to the Lotus Hell.â The Teacher came in, and said he, âWhat speak you of, monks, as you sit here?â They told him.

Here again the Teacher said: âThis is not the only time, monks, that KokÄlika has been ruined by talking; it was the same before.â And then he told the story as follows.

The turtle by letting out an utterance surely killed himself, while having a good grip on a stick, by speaking he killed himself.

Having seen this, chief of vigorous men, speak a word that is wholesome and concise.  You see, by talking much too much, the turtle came to disaster.

This discourse ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka, âKokÄlika was the turtle then, the two famous elders were the two wild geese, Änanda was the king, and I was his wise adviser.â

Long ago by her means you came near being spitted and roasted for food, but wise men saved your life.â Then he told a tale of the past.

It is not this fire that burns me, nor the spit that is well fashioned, but my lady  thinking of me: âHe went for joy to another.â

The fire of lust it is that burns me, and my heart it does torment. Fisherman, master, free me, there is no pleasure in being killed.

 This story the Teacher told, while dwelling at Jetavana, about a greengrocer who was a lay brother.


The circumstances have already been given in the First Book. 
No. 102 
Paá¹á¹ikajÄtaka
, where recurs the second verse.

This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a lay brother who was a greengrocer in SÄvatthi and made a living by the sale of various roots and vegetables, and pumpkins and the like. Now he had a pretty daughter who was as good and virtuous as she was pretty, but was always laughing. And when she was asked in marriage by a family of his own station in life, he thought: âShe ought to be married, but sheâs always laughing; and a bad girl married into a strange family is her parentsâ shame. I must find out for certain whether she is a good girl or not.â


So one day he made his daughter take a basket and come with him to the forest to gather herbs. Then to try her, he took her by the hand with whispered words of love. Straightaway the girl burst into tears and began to cry out that such a thing would be as monstrous as fire rising out of water, and she besought him to forbear. Then he told her that his only intent was to try her, and asked whether she was virtuous. And she declared that she was and that she had never looked on any man with eyes of love. Calming her fears and taking her back home, he made a feast and gave her in marriage. Then feeling that he ought to go and pay his respects to the Teacher, he took perfumes and garlands in his hand and went to Jetavana.

Here again the Teacher asked him where he had been so long; and he replied, âMy daughter, sir, is always smiling. After testing her, I gave her in marriage to a young gentleman. As this had to be done, I had no opportunity of paying you a visit.â To this the Teacher answered, âNot only now is your daughter virtuous, but virtuous she was in days of yore; and as you have tested her now, so you tested her in those days.â And at the manâs request he told a story of the past.

All the world has delight in lovemaking, you are unskilled in village ways, Seggu, child, how is this thing known to you today? Having grabbed you, you cry out in the woods.

The one who should shelter me from suffering, my father, is treacherous inside the woods, to whom will I cry out amidst the woods? he who protects me, offers violence.

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he declared the Truths and identified the JÄtaka, at the end of the Truths the greengrocer entered on the Fruit of the First Path, âIn those days, father and daughter were the same as now, and the Tree DevatÄ that saw it all was I myself.â

âWell planned indeed!â
 
 [2.127]
 
{2.181}
 This story the Teacher told while staying in Jetavana, about a dishonest trader.


There were two traders of SÄvatthi, one pious and the other a cheat. These two joined partnership, and loaded five hundred wagons full of wares, journeying from east to west for trade; and returned to SÄvatthi with large profits.


The pious trader suggested to his partner that they should divide their stock. The rogue thought to himself, âThis fellow has been roughing it for ever so long with bad food and lodging. Now heâs at home again, heâll eat all sorts of dainties and die of a surfeit. Then I shall have all the stock for myself.â What he said was, âNeither the stars nor the day are favourable; tomorrow or the next day weâll see about it,â so he kept putting it off. However, the pious trader pressed him, and the division was made. Then he went with scents and garlands to visit the Teacher; and after a respectful obeisance, he sat on one side. The Teacher asked when he had returned. âJust a fortnight ago, sir,â said he. âThen why have you delayed to visit the Buddha?â The trader explained. Then the Teacher said: âIt is not only now that your partner is a rogue; he was just the same before,â and at his request told him a story of the past.

Treachery to the treacherous is well thought-out, fraud to the fraudulent is planted in return, if the mice can devour a ploughshare, why can a hawk not carry away a boy child? 
[2.129]

There is fraud upon fraud for the fraudulent one, there is cheating in return for the one who cheats, he must give the ploughshare to the one who lost it, the one who lost his ploughshare must not steal his child. 
{2.184}

When this discourse was ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka, âThe cheat in both cases was the same, and so was the clever man; I myself was the Lord Chief Justice.â

When asked by the Teacher if he really were discontented, he said yes; asked why, he replied that it was through his passions. âO monk!â said the Teacher, âthis passion has been despised even by the lower animals; and can you, a monk in such a dispensation, yield to discontent arising from the passion that even brutes despise?â Then he told him a story of the past.

Unwrought gold is mine, wrought gold is mine, this they say by night and day, unintelligent men do not consider the noble Dhamma.

There are two householders in the house, one has no beard in that place, pendulant breasts, plaited hair, and perforated ears, being bought with lots of wealth, she attacks the people.

## Full Story
âIf any man.â
 This story the Teacher told while staying at Jetavana, about Devadatta.


It was occasioned by something that happened at RÄjagaha. At one period the Captain of the Dhamma was living with five hundred monks at the Bamboo Grove. And Devadatta, with a body of men, wicked, like himself, lived at GayÄsÄ«sa.


At that time the citizens of RÄjagaha used to club together for the purpose of almsgiving. A trader, who had come there on business, brought a magnificent perfumed yellow robe, asking that he might become one of them, and give this garment as his contribution. The townspeople brought plenty of gifts. All that was contributed by those who had clubbed together consisted of ready money. There was this garment left. The crowd which had come together said: âHere is this beautiful perfumed robe left over. Who shall have it â elder SÄriputta, or Devadatta?â Some were in favour of SÄriputta; others said: âElder SÄriputta will stay here a few days, 
{2.197}
 and then go travelling at his own sweet will; but Devadatta always lives near our city; he is our refuge in good fortune or ill. Devadatta shall have it!â They made a division, and those who voted for Devadatta were in the majority. So to Devadatta they gave it. He had it cut in strips, and sewn together, and coloured like gold, and so he wore it upon him.


At the same time, thirty monks went from RÄjagaha to SÄvatthi to salute the Teacher. After greetings had been exchanged, they told him all this affair, adding, âAnd so, sir, Devadatta wears this mark of the saint, which suits him ill enough.â âMonks,â said the Teacher, âthis is not the first time that Devadatta has put on the garb of a saint, a most unsuitable dress. He did the same before.â And then he told them a story.

The one who, while still being impure, will put on the yellow robe, abstaining from restraint and truth, is not worthy of the yellow robe.

The one who throws out any impurity, steady in virtue, endowed with restraint and truth, is worthy of the yellow robe. 
{2.199}

After this discourse was ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka, âDevadatta was the man who killed the elephants, and the head of the herd was I.â

The Teacher came in, and asked what they were talking about as they sat there. They told him. Then he said: âThis is not the first time, monks, that Devadatta has been harsh, cruel, merciless. He was so before.â And he told them a story.

This is the word of my teacher, this is what PÄrÄsariya said: âDo not do anything wicked, which later will cause you regret.â

Whatever a person does, the same he will see in himself, the one who does good will see good, the one who does wrong will see wrong, whatever seed he sews, the same kind he will carry off as fruit.

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, by which he showed how in other days, as then, Devadatta had been harsh, cruel, and merciless, he identified the JÄtaka in these words, âIn those days Devadatta was the hunter, SÄriputta was the famous teacher, Änanda was CÅ«á¸·anandiya, the noble lady GotamÄ« was the mother, and I was the monkey Nandiya.â

 This story the Teacher told in Jetavana, about a landed proprietor.


Tradition has it that once a landowner who was a citizen of SÄvatthi did business with a landowner from the country. 
{2.203}
 Taking his wife with him, he visited this man, his debtor; but the debtor averred that he could not pay. The other, in anger, set out for home without having broken his fast. On the road, some people met him; and seeing how famished the man was, gave him food, bidding him share it with his wife. 
[2.143]


When he got this, he grudged his wife a share. So addressing her he said: âWife, this is a well-known haunt of thieves, so you had better go in front.â Having thus got rid of her, he ate all the food, and then showed her the pot empty, saying: âLook here, wife! They gave me an empty pot!â She guessed that he had eaten it all up himself, and was much annoyed.


As they both passed by the monastery in Jetavana, they thought they would go into the park and get a drink of water. There sat the Teacher, waiting on purpose to see them, like a hunter on the trail, seated under the shade of his perfumed cell. He greeted then kindly, and said: âLay sister, is your husband kind and loving?â âI love him, sir,â she replied, âbut he does not love me; let alone other days, this very day he was given a pot of food on the way, and gave not a bit to me, but ate it all himself.â âLay sister, so it has always been â you loving and kind, and he loveless; but when by the help of the wise he learns your worth, he will do you all honour.â Then, at her request, he told a story of the past.

Reverence to the reverent, follow the one who follows you, she should do her duty to the one doing his duty, but she need not do good to the one who wishes her harm, no one needs to love those who do not have love in return.

Abandon the one who abandons, not having desire, she need not love the one who is devoid of thought for her. A bird, knowing that a tree is devoid of fruit, can look for another tree in this great wide world.

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he declared the Truths, and identified the JÄtaka, at the conclusion of the Truths the husband and wife entered on the Fruit of the First Path. âThe husband and wife are the same in both cases, and the wise counsellor was I myself.â

He who, monkey-king, like you, has these four things: Truth, wisdom, courage, charity, will overcome his foe.

For whoever these supremely auspicious virtues are not found, truth, wisdom, courage, charity, will not overcome his foe.

Said the Teacher, âThis is not the first time then, monks, that Devadatta has gone about seeking to kill me; he did just the same in bygone days too.â And, having ended his lesson, the Teacher showed the connection and identified the JÄtaka by saying: âDevadatta was the crocodile of those days, the brahmin-girl CiÃ±cÄ was the crocodileâs wife, and I myself the monkey-king.â

 A story told by the Teacher at Jetavana, about the king of Kosala. This king started to quell a border rising at a bad season of the year. The circumstances have been described already. 
[Ja 176. I include the story here.]

One rainy season, disaffection broke out on his borders. The troops stationed there, after two or three battles in which they failed to conquer their adversaries, sent a message to the king. In spite of the season, in spite of the rains, he took the field, and encamped before Jetavana. Then he began to ponder. â âTis a bad season for an expedition; every crevice and hollow is full of water; the road is heavy: Iâll go visit the Teacher. He will be sure to ask âwhither away;â then Iâll tell him. It is not only in things of the future life that our Teacher protects me, but he protects in the things which we now see. So if my going is not to prosper, he will say âIt is a bad time to go, sire;â but if I am to prosper, he will say nothing.â So into Jetavana he came, and after greeting the Teacher sat down on one side.


âWhence come you, O king,â asked the Teacher, âat this unseasonable hour?â âSir,â he replied, âI am on my way to quell a border rising; and I come first to bid you farewell.â To this the Teacher said: âSo it happened before, that mighty monarchs, before setting out for war, have listened to the word of the wise, and turned back from an unseasonable expedition.â

The Teacher as before told the king a story.

Going at the right time is good, not going at the wrong time is good, by going out at the wrong time, alone, and with the many folk, nothing explains the meaning like the owl with the army of crows.

The wise one knows the rules and commands, follows the faults of others, bringing all foes under control, he will be happy like the owl. 
{2.209}

This discourse ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka, âÄnanda was then the king, and the wise courtier was I myself.â

âWell matched.â
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana, about one of the monks.


There stood at that time, about three-quarters 
GÄvutaddhayojanamatte
. It may possibly mean âan eighth.â
 of a league from Jetavana, a market town, where a great deal of rice was distributed by ticket, and special meals were given. Here lived an inquisitive lout, who pestered the young monks and novices who came to share in the distribution â 
{2.210}
 âWho are for solid food? Who for drink? Who for moist food?â And he made those who could not answer feel ashamed, and they dreaded him so much that they would not go to that village.


One day, a monk came to the ticket-hall, with the question, âAny food for distribution in such-and-such a village, sir?â âYes, friend,â was the answer, âbut thereâs a roughneck here asking questions; if you canât answer them, he abuses and reviles you. He is such a pest that nobody will go near the place.â âSir,â said the other, âgive me an order on the place, and Iâll humble him, and make him modest, and so influence him that whenever he sees you after this, heâll feel inclined to run away.â


The monks agreed, and gave the necessary order. The monk walked to our village, and at the gate of it he put on his robe. The loafer spied him â was at him like a mad ram, with, âAnswer me a question, monk!â âLayman, let me go first about the village for my broth, and then come back with it to the waiting hall.â


When he returned with his meal, the man repeated his question. The monk answered, âLeave me to finish my broth, to sweep the room, and to fetch my ticketâs worth of rice.â So he fetched the rice; then placing his bowl in this very manâs hands, he said: âCome, now Iâll answer your question.â 
[2.148]


Then he led him outside the village, folded his outer robe, put it on his shoulder, and taking the bowl from the other, stood waiting for him to begin. The man said: âMonk, answer me one question.â âVery well, so I will,â said the monk; and with one blow he felled him to the ground, bruised his eyes, beat him, dropped filth in his face, and went off, with these parting words to frighten him, âIf ever again you ask a question of any monk who comes to this village, Iâll see about it!â After this, he took to his heels at the mere sight of a monk.


By and by all this became known among the Saá¹gha. One day they were talking about it in the Dhamma Hall, âFriend, I hear that monk So-and-so dropped filth in the face of that loafer, and left him!â The Teacher came in, and wanted to know what they were all talking about as they sat there. They told him. Said he, âMonks, this is not the first time this monk attacked the man with dirt, but he did just the same before.â Then he told them a story. 
{2.211}

A hero comes across a hero, beating him with heroism, come, O NÄga, turn back again, why do you run away in fear? See, people of Aá¹ga and Magadha, my heroism and yours.

Not with my feet will I kill you, not with my tusks, not with my trunk, I will kill you with excrement, the rotten will kill the rotten. 
{2.212}

When this discourse was ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka, âIn those days, this lout was the dung-beetle, the monk in question was the elephant, and I was the Tree DevatÄ who saw it all from a clump of trees.â

## Full Story
âThree forts.â
 
[2.149]
 This story the Teacher told at Jetavana about a brahmin named KÄmanÄ«ta. The circumstances will be explained in the Twelfth Book, and the KÄmajÄtaka [Ja 467].

A brahmin, so they say, who dwelt at SÄvatthi, was felling trees on the bank of the AciravatÄ«, in order to cultivate the land. The Teacher, when he visited SÄvatthi for alms, perceiving his destiny, went out of his road to talk sweetly with him. âWhat are you doing, brahmin?â he asked. âO Gotama,â said the man, âI am cutting a space free for cultivation.â âVery good,â he replied, âgo on with your work, brahmin.â


In the same manner the Teacher came and talked with him when the felled trunks were all away, and the man was clearing his acre, and again at plowing time, and at making the little embanked squares for water. Now on the day of sowing, the brahmin said: âToday, O Gotama, is my plowing festival. When this corn is ripe, I will give alms in plenty to the Saá¹gha, with the Buddha at their head.â The Teacher accepted his offer, and went away. On another day he came, and saw the brahmin watching the corn. âWhat are you doing, brahmin?â asked he. âWatching the corn, O Gotama!â âVery good, brahmin,â said the Teacher, and away he went. Then the brahmin thought: âHow often Gotama the ascetic comes this way! Without doubt he wants food. Well, food I will give him.â On the day when this thought came into his mind, when he went home, there he found the Teacher come also. Thereat arose in the brahmin a wondrous great confidence.


By and by, when ripe was the corn, the brahmin resolved, tomorrow he would reap the field. But while he lay in bed, in the upper reaches of the AciravatÄ« the rain fell heavily; down came a flood, and carried the whole crop away to the sea, so that not one stalk was left. When the flood subsided, and the brahmin beheld the destruction of his crops, he had not the strength to stand: pressing his hand to his heart â for he was overcome with great sorrow â he went weeping home, and lay down lamenting.


In the morning the Teacher saw this brahmin overwhelmed with his woe, and he thought: âI will be the brahminâs support.â So next day, after his alms-round in SÄvatthi, on his return from receipt of food he sent the monks back to their monastery, and himself with the junior who attended him visited the manâs house. When the brahmin heard of his coming, he took heart, thinking: âMy friend must be come for a kindly talk.â He offered him a seat; the Teacher entering sat upon the seat indicated, and asked, âWhy are you downhearted, brahmin? What has happened to displease you?â âO Gotama!â said the man, âfrom the time that I cut down the trees on the bank of the AciravatÄ«, you know what I have been doing. I have been going about, and promising gifts to you when that crop should be ripe: now a flood has carried off the whole crop, away to the sea, nothing is left at all! Grain has been destroyed to the amount of a hundred wagon-loads, and so I am deep in grief!â âWhy, will what is lost come back for grieving?â âNo, Gotama, that will it not.â âIf that is so, why grieve? The wealth of beings in this world, or their corn, when they have it, they have it, and when it is gone, why, gone it is. No composite thing but is subject to destruction; do not brood over it.â Thus comforting him, the Teacher repeated the KÄma discourse as appropriate to his case. At the conclusion of the discourse, the mourning brahmin was established in the Fruit of the First Path. The Teacher having eased him of his pain, arose from his seat, and returned to the monastery.


All the town heard how the Teacher had found such a brahmin pierced with the pangs of grief, had consoled him and established him in the Fruit of the First Path.


The monks talked of it in the Dhamma Hall, âHear, sirs! The One with Ten Powers made friends with a brahmin, grew intimate, took his opportunity to declare the Dhamma to him, when pierced with the pangs of grief, eased him of pain, and established him in the Fruit of the First Path!â The Teacher came in, and asked, âWhat do you speak of, monks, as you sit here together?â They told him. He replied, âThis is not the first time, monks, I have cured his grief, but I did the same long, long ago,â and with these words he told a story of the past.

Three inside of the mountain I desire, the PaÃ±cÄlas, Kurus and Kekakas, more than that, brahmin, I desire that you cure me, brahmin, one guided by desire.

Some there are who can work the bite of the cobras, the wise can work possession by Amanussa. But no one can work one who is led by desire, what cure is there for one fallen from purity?

When this discourse was ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka, âThe monk who is a slave to his desires was at that time the king; and I myself was Sakka.â

## Full Story
âLo, my elephants.â
 This story the Teacher told at Jetavana, about a mendicant, with vagrant tastes.


He traversed the whole of JambudÄ«pa for the purpose of arguing, and found no one to contradict him. At last he got as far as SÄvatthi, and asked was there any one there who could argue with him. The people said: âThere is one who could argue with a thousand such â all-wise, chief of men, the mighty Gotama, lord of the faith, who bears down all opposition, there is no adversary in all JambudÄ«pa who can dispute with him. As the billows break upon the shore, so all arguments break against his feet, and are dashed to spray.â Thus they described the qualities of the Buddha. 
[2.152]


âWhere is he now?â asked the mendicant. âHe is at Jetavana,â they replied. âNow Iâll get up a debate with him!â said the mendicant. So attended by a large crowd he made his way to Jetavana. On seeing the gate towers of Jetavana, 
The Jetavana monastery is represented on the BhÄrhut StÅ«pa (Cunningham, pl. LVII); for the

, see pl. xxviii, fig. 3.
 which prince Jeta had built at a cost of ninety millions of money, he asked whether that was the palace where the ascetic Gotama lived. The gateway of it, they said. âIf this be the gateway, what will the dwelling be like!â he cried. âThereâs no end to the perfumed chambers!â the people said. âWho could argue with such a monk as this?â he asked; and hurried off at once.


The crowd shouted for joy, and thronged into the park. âWhat brings you here before your time?â asked the Teacher. They told him what had happened. Said he, âThis is not the first time, laymen, that he hurried away at the mere sight of the gateway of my dwelling. He did the same before.â And at their request, he told a story of the past. 
{2.217}

With clouds of great elephants, with garlanded great horses, with a wave of chariots, with a great rain of arrows, with the whirlpool of weapon-handlers giving them strong blows, beseiging the great city of Taxila on all sides.

Run up against them, approach them quickly, with the sounding of various noises, continue the great sound today, just as with lightning flashes, the rain cloud thunders. 
{2.218}

This discourse ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka, âOur mendicant wanderer was then the king of Benares, and I was the king of Taxila myself.â

At that time, the Teacher, with a large company round him, sitting on the beautifully adorned throne of the truth, upon a vermilion dais, was discoursing like a young lion roaring with a lionâs roar. The mendicant, seeing the One with Ten Powersâ form like the form of Brahma, his face like the glory of the full moon, and his forehead like a plate of gold, turned round where he had come, in the midst of the crowd, and ran off, saying: âWho could overcome a man like this?â


The crowd went in chase, then came back and told the Teacher. He said: âNot only now has this mendicant fled at the mere sight of my golden face; he did the same before.â And he told a story of the past.

Measureless are the banners, endless on all sides,  as hard to overcome as the ocean by crows, as hard to overcome as a mountain by wind, as hard to overcome as am I now by such. 
{2.220}

Fool, do not talk this nonsense, such is not his, when on fire do not receive one who obstructs you, you attack like a solitary elephant, like one who crushes a reed with his foot.

This discourse ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka, âThe vagrant wanderer was at that time the king of GandhÄra, and the king of Benares was I myself.â

They told him. The Teacher said: âMonks, this is not the first time that Devadatta has repudiated his teacher, and become my enemy, and come to utter destruction. The same thing happened before.â Then he told them a story.

Just as when someone, buying menâs shoes for ease and use, so suffering could be removed, oppressed by the scorching heat on the feet, they chafe at the feet of that person.

So he of bad family, ignoble, stealing this science and learning of yours, being consumed by his learning right there, the ignoble one is like a bad shoe.

 This story the Teacher told while staying at Jetavana, about a young lady.


She was the only daughter of a rich merchant of SÄvatthi. She noticed that in her fatherâs house a great fuss was made over a fine bull, and asked her nurse what it meant. âWho is this, nurse, that is honoured so?â The nurse replied that it was a right royal bull.


Another day she was looking from an upper storey down the street, when lo, she spied a hunchback. 
{2.225}
 Thought she, âIn the cow tribe, the leader has a hump. I suppose itâs the same with men. That must be a right, royal man, and I must go and be his humble follower.â So she sent her maid to say that the merchantâs daughter wished to join herself to him, and he was to wait for her in a certain spot. She collected her treasures together, and disguising herself; left the mansion and went off with the hunchback.


By and by all this became known in the town and among the Saá¹gha. In the Dhamma Hall, the monks discussed its bearings, âFriend, there is a merchantâs daughter who has eloped with a hunchback!â The Teacher came in, and asked what they were all talking about together. They told him. He replied, âThis is not the first time, monks, that she has fallen in love with a hunchback. She did the same before.â And he told them a story.

Having had a sole thought of welfare the fool, who is not a guide, is surely not worthy to join up, dear lady, with the hunchbacked dwarf.  
[2.157]

Thinking this was a bull of a man, I desired this hunchbacked man, this same shrunken person lies down like a lute with a broken string.

Surely go wherever you so desire, you are shot in the vitals with a barb, you have been killed by your food and by sound, the greedy one is following the fish.

So also when falling on worldliness, following the mindâs desire, he suffers, he dies in the midst of kin and of friends, like the crocodile following the fish.

âNow desire has gone.â
 This story the Teacher told while staying at Jetavana, about a young girl.


Tradition tells us that a certain man at SÄvatthi, a servant of the Teacherâs two chief disciples, had one beautiful and happy daughter. When she grew 
[2.159]
 up, she married into a family as good as her own. The husband, without consulting anybody, used to enjoy himself elsewhere at his own sweet will. She took no notice of his disrespect; but invited the two chief disciples, made them presents, and listened to their preaching, until she reached the Fruit of the First Path. After this she spent all her time in the enjoyment of the Path and the Fruit; at last, thinking that as her husband did not want her, there was no need for her to remain in the household, she determined to embrace the ascetic life. She informed her parents of her plan, carried it out, and became a saint.


Her story became known amongst the Saá¹gha; and one day they were discussing it in the Dhamma Hall. âFriend, the daughter of such and such a family strives to attain the highest good. Finding that her husband did not care for her, she made rich presents to the chief disciples, listened to their preaching, and gained the Fruit of the First Path; she took leave of her parents, became an ascetic, and then a saint. So, friend, the girl sought the highest good.â While they were talking, the Teacher came in and asked what it was all about. They told him. He said: âThis is not the first time, monks, that she seeks the highest; she did so in olden days as well.â And he told a story of the past.

Now you are done, sensual desire in you has been overcome, just as a tusk that is cut off with a saw cannot be rejoined. 
[2.160]

Great desire, with great greed together with excessively great greed, cuts off  our welfare, just as I was cut off from AsitÄbhÅ«.

After this discourse was ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka, âThese two people were then the prince and princess, and I was the ascetic.â

The Bodhisatta = (the wanderer) Vacchanakha,

Roja the Mallian = the wealthy man of Benares (BÄrÄá¹asÄ«seá¹­á¹­hi).

## Full Story
âHouses in the world are sweet.â
 This story the Teacher told at Jetavana, about Roja the Mallian.


We learn that this man, who was a lay friend of Änandaâs, sent the elder a message that he should come to him. The elder took leave of the Teacher, and went. He served the elder with all sorts of food, and sat down on one side, engaging him in a pleasant conversation. Then he offered the elder a share of his house, tempting him by the five channels of desire. âÄnanda, sir, I have at home great store of live and dead stock. I will divide it and give you half; let us live in one house together!â The elder declared to him the suffering which is involved in desire; then rose from his seat, and returned to the monastery.


When the Teacher asked whether he had seen Roja, he replied that he had. âWhat did he say to you?â âSir, Roja invited me to return to the world; then I explained to him the suffering involved in desires and the worldly life.â The Teacher said: âÄnanda, this is not the first time that Roja the Mallian has invited ascetics to return to the world; he did the same before,â and then, at his request, he told a story of the past. 
{2.232}

Vacchanakha, households are pleasant, having gold and having food, where, after eating and drinking, you can lie down free from desire.

No houses for the one who does not exert himself, no houses without speaking lies, no houses for the one with a stick, who does not defraud others, so being faulty and hard to endure, who would practice in a house?

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he identified the JÄtaka, âRoja the Mallian was the Benares merchant, and I was Vacchanakha the mendicant.â

## Full Story
âWhy are hearts cold.â
 This story the Teacher told during a stay near SÄketa, about a brahmin named SÄketa. Both the circumstances that suggested the story and the story itself have already been given in the First Book. 
[Ja 68. I include the story here.]
 
[2.163]

This story was told by the Teacher, while at AÃ±janavana, about a certain brahmin. Tradition says that when the Fortunate One with his disciples was entering the city of SÄketa, an old brahmin of that place, who was going out, met him in the gateway. Falling at the One with Ten Powersâ feet, and clasping him by the ankles, the old man cried, âSon, is it not the duty of children to cherish the old age of their parents? Why have you not let us see you all this long time? At last I have seen you; come, let your mother see you too.â So saying, he took the Teacher with him to his house; and there the Teacher sat upon the seat prepared for him, with his disciples around him. Then came the brahminâs wife, and she too fell at the feet of the Fortunate One, crying, âMy son, where have you been all this time? Is it not the duty of children to comfort their parents in their old age?â Hereon, she called to her sons and daughters that their brother was come, and made them salute the Buddha. And in their joy the aged pair showed great hospitality to their guests. After his meal, the Teacher recited to the old people the Sutta concerning old-age; and, when he had ended, both husband and wife won fruition of the Second Path. Then rising up from his seat, the Teacher went back to AÃ±janavana.


Meeting together in the Dhamma Hall, the monks fell to talking about this thing. It was urged that the brahmin must have been well aware that Suddhodana was the father, and MahÄmÄyÄ the mother, of the TathÄgata; yet none the less, he and his wife had claimed the TathÄgata as their own son â and that with the Teacherâs assent. What could it all mean? Hearing their talk, the Teacher said: âMonks, the aged pair were right in claiming me as their son.â And so saying, he told this story of the past.

What is the reason, BhagavÄ, some people here, have a heart extremely cool, and a mind of faith?

Through living together in the past or being beneficial in the present, in this way love arises, like a water-lily arises on the water.

After this discourse was ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka, âThese two people were the brahmin and his wife in the story; and I was their son.â

This question referred to the means of entering on the Paths.
 question. He replied, âThat question requires a Buddha; nobody else can answer it.â So he took his son to Jetavana, and saluted the Teacher. âSir,â said he, âas my son sat on my hip, he asked me the question called the âDoor.â I didnât know the answer, so here I am to ask you to give it.â Said the Teacher, âThis is not the first time, layman, that the lad has been a seeker after the way to accomplish his ends, and asked wise men this question; he did so before, and wise men in olden days gave him the answer; but by reason of a multitude of rebirths, he has forgotten it.â And at his request the Teacher told a tale of the olden time.

Come, speak one word, father, a word relying on multiple meanings, something comprehensive, by which our purpose may be successful.

Skill is one word, dear, a word relying on multiple meanings, thatâs connected with virtue, being accomplished in forebearance, able to endow friends with happiness, enemies with suffering. 
{2.237}

When this discourse was ended, the Teacher declared the Truths and identified the JÄtaka, at the conclusion of the Truths father and son reached the Fruit of the First Path, âThis man was then the son, and I was the merchant of Benares myself.â

âWhen I was in their cage.â
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling in the Bamboo Grove, about AjÄtasattu.


MahÄkosala, the king of Kosalaâs father, when he married his daughter to king BimbisÄra, had given her a village in KÄsi to support her. After AjÄtasattu murdered BimbisÄra, his father, the queen very soon died of love for him. Even after his motherâs death, AjÄtasattu still enjoyed the revenues of this village. But the king of Kosala determined that no parricide should have a village which was his by right of inheritance, and made war upon him. Sometimes the uncle got the best of it, and sometimes the nephew. And when AjÄtasattu was victor, he raised his banner and marched through the country back to his capital in triumph; but when he lost, all downcast he returned without letting any one know.


It happened on a day that the monks sat talking about it in the Dhamma Hall. âFriend,â so one would say, âAjÄtasattu is delighted when he beats his uncle, and when he loses he is cast down.â The Teacher, entering the Hall, asked what they were discussing this time; 
{2.238}
 and they told him. He said: âMonks, this is not the first time that the man has been happy when he conquered, and miserable when he did not.â And he told them a story. 
[2.165]

Though a poisonous snake, when I entered the mouth of the fish trap, the green frog found satisfaction when the little fish did bite me.

A man will steal for as long as it is of benefit to him, but when the others steal, the one stealing is the one stolen from.

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he identified the JÄtaka, âAjÄtasattu was the water-snake, and the green frog was I.â

Devadatta for nine months had tried to compass the destruction of the future Buddha, and had sunk down into the earth by the gateway of Jetavana.
 [2.166]


Then they that dwelt at Jetavana and in all the country round about were delighted, saying: âDevadatta the enemy of Buddha has been swallowed up in the earth: the adversary is slain, and the Teacher has become perfectly Awakened!â 
{2.240}
 And hearing these words spoken many a time and oft, the people of all the continent of JambudÄ«pa, and all the Yakkhas, and BhÅ«tas, and Devas were delighted likewise.


One day, all the monks were talking together in the Dhamma Hall, and thus would they say, âMonk, since Devadatta sank into the earth, what a number of people are glad, saying, Devadatta is swallowed up by the earth!â The Teacher entered, and asked, âWhat are you all talking about here, monks?â They told him. Then said he, âThis is not the first time, O monks, that multitudes have rejoiced and laughed aloud at the death of Devadatta. Long ago they rejoiced and laughed as they do now.â And he told them a story.

All people were harassed by Piá¹gala, now, because he is dead, they feel delight, what was the one with tawny eyes to you? Why are you crying, watchman of the door?

The one with tawny eyes wasnât dear to me, but his coming back I truly do fear, going from here should he harrass Deathâs King, being harrassed he may sent him back here.

Heâs burned by thousands of cartloads, cooled by hundreds of water pots, the earth has been dug up, please do not fear, he is not coming back!

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he identified the JÄtaka, âDevadatta was Piá¹gala; and his son was I myself.â

 This story the Teacher told while living in Jetavana, about a dog that used to be fed in the resting hall by the Ambala tower.


It is said that from a puppy this dog had been kept there and fed by some water-carriers. In course of time it grew up there to be a big dog. Once a 
[2.171]
 villager happened to see him; and he bought him from the water-carriers for an upper garment and a rupee; then, fastening him to a chain, led the dog away. The dog was led away, unresisting, making no sound, and followed and followed the new master, eating whatever was offered. âHeâs fond of me, no doubt,â thought the man; and let him free from the chain. No sooner did the dog find himself free, than off he went, and never stopped until he came back to the place he started from.


Seeing him, the monks guessed what had happened; and in the evening, when they were gathered in the Dhamma Hall, they began talking about it. âFriend, hereâs the dog back again in our resting hall! How clever he must have been, to get rid of his chain! No sooner free, than back he ran!â The Teacher, entering, asked what they were all talking about as they sat together. They told him. He rejoined, âMonks, this is not the first time our dog was clever at getting rid of his chain; he was just the same before.â And he told them a story.

The foolish dog does not chew his way through this strap, you could be free from bonds, gnawing you could go home.

[2.180]
 This is a story told by the Teacher while he stayed near Ukkaá¹­á¹­hÄ, in the Subhagavana Park, in connection with the Discourse on the Succession of Causes.


At that time, it is said, five hundred brahmins who had mastered the three Vedas, having embraced this dispensation, studied the Three Piá¹­akas. These learned, they became intoxicated with pride, thinking to themselves, âThe Supreme Buddha knows just the Three Piá¹­akas, and we know them too. So what is the difference between us?â They discontinued their waiting upon the Buddha, and went about with an equal following of their own.


One day the Teacher, when these men were seated before him, repeated the Discourse on the Succession of Causes, 
[MN 1.]
 and adorned it with the eight grounds. They did not understand a word. The thought came into their mind, âHere we have been believing that there were none so wise as we, and of this we understand nothing. There is none so wise as the Buddhas: O the excellence of the Buddhas!â After this they were humbled, as quiet as serpents with their fangs extracted.


When the Teacher had stayed as long as he wished in Ukkaá¹­á¹­hÄ, he departed to VesÄli; and at Gotamaâs shrine he repeated the Discourse on the Gotamaka Shrine. 
[
Gotamakacetiyasutta
, AN 3.126.]
 There was a quaking of a thousand worlds! Hearing this, these monks became saints.


But however, after the Teacher had finished repeating the Discourse on the Succession of Causes, during his visit to Ukkaá¹­á¹­hÄ 
{2.260}
 the monks discussed the whole affair in the Dhamma Hall. âHow great is the power of the Buddhas, friend! Why, these brahmin mendicants, who used to be so drunk with pride, have been humbled by the Discourse on the Succession of Causes!â The Teacher entered and asked what their talk was about. They told him. He said: âMonks, this is not the first time that I have humbled these men, who used to carry their heads so high with pride; I did the same before.â And then he told them a tale of the olden time.

Times devours all beings including its very own self, that being who devours time, roasts the roaster of beings.

Many people have heads and hair growing on them, which are fastened on necks, and someone here has ears.

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time these monks were the five hundred pupils; and I myself was their teacher.â

 This is a story which the Teacher told while staying in his gabled chamber near VesÄli, about SÄ«hasenÄpati.


It is said that this man, after he had fled to the refuge, offered hospitality and then gave food with meat in it. The naked ascetics on hearing this were angry and displeased; they wanted to do the TathÄgata a mischief, âThe ascetic Gotama,â sneered they, âwith his eyes open, eats meat prepared on purpose for him.â


The monks discussed this matter in their Dhamma Hall, âFriend, NÄthaputta the naked ascetic 
He is one of the six 
titthiyas
 (Heretics), and generally called 
NÄthaputta
 (which is probably the right spelling here). The ânaked asceticsâ were probably the Jains.
 goes about sneering, because, he says, âThe ascetic Gotama eats meat prepared on purpose for him, with his eyes open.â â Hearing this, the Teacher rejoined, âThis is not the first time, monks, that NÄthaputta has been sneering at me for eating meat which was got ready for me on purpose; he did just so in former times.â And he told them a story.

Having hit, cut, slaughtered, the unrestrained gives a gift, eating such food he is defiled with wickedness. 
{2.263}

Having slaughtered wife and son the unrestrained gives a gift, though the wise one is eating he is not defiled with wickedness. 
[2.183]

This discourse ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka, âNÄthaputta, the naked ascetic was this wealthy man, and I was the ascetic.â

One day, it is said, the two chief disciples were discussing a question. The monks who heard the discussion praised the elders. Elder LÄá¸·udÄyi, who sat amongst the company, curled his lip with the thought: âWhat is their knowledge compared with mine?â When the monks noticed this, they left him. The company broke up.


The monks were talking about it in the Dhamma Hall. âFriend, did you see how LÄá¸·udÄyi curled his lip in scorn of the two chief disciples?â On hearing which the Teacher said: âMonks, in olden days, as now, LÄá¸·udÄyi had no other answer but a curl of the lip.â Then he told them a story. 
{2.264}

Surely PÄdaÃ±jali outshines with wisdom all of us, for he curls his lip, could it be he sees something further? 
[2.184]

He does not know right or wrong, or, this is good or not good, aside from his useless lip, he does not know anything!

Four monks, approaching the TathÄgata, asked him to explain the means by which Absorption may be induced. This he explained. This done, they dispersed to the several places where they spent their nights and days. One of them, having learned the Six Sense Spheres, became a saint; another did so after learning the Five Elements of Being, the third after learning the Four Principal Elements, the fourth after learning the Eighteen Constituents of Being. Each of them recounted to the Teacher the particular excellence which he had attained. A thought came into the mind of one of them; and he asked the Teacher, âThere is only one NibbÄna for all these modes of meditation; how is it that all of them lead to becoming an Arahat?â Then the Teacher asked, âIs not this like the people who saw the Flame of the Forest?â As they requested him to tell them about it, he repeated a tale of bygone days.

The Kiá¹suka has been seen by you all, why are you doubtful here? you havenât questioned the charioteer about all conditions!

In this way, for those who do not understand things with all knowledge, they doubt about things, like the brothers regarding the Kiá¹suka.

When this discourse was ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time I was the king of Benares.â

It is said that he had ordained a youth, whom he treated unkindly. The novice at last could stand it no longer, and returned to the world. Then the elder tried to coax him. 
{2.267}
 âLook here, lad,â said he, âyour robe shall be your own, and your bowl too; I have another bowl and robe which Iâll give you. Join us again!â At first he refused, but at last after much asking he did so. From the day he joined the Saá¹gha the elder maltreated him as before. Again the lad found it too much, and left the order. As the elder begged him again several times to join, the lad replied, âYou can neither do with me nor without me; let me alone â I will not join!â


The monks got talking about this in the Dhamma Hall. âFriend,â they said, âa sensitive lad that! He knew the elder too well to join us.â The Teacher came in and asked what they were talking about. They told him. He rejoined, âNot only is the lad sensitive now, monks, but he was just the same of old; when once he saw the faults of that man, he would not accept him again.â And he told a story of the past.

Youâll be my only child, you will be master in our family, descend from the tree, SÄlaka, come now we should go to our home. 
[2.187]

My heart is surely good, you think, but you beat me with bamboo sticks, we enjoy this ripe mango wood, you go to your home as you like.

 asked what they were discussing together. They told him. Said he, âMonks, it is not the only time this monk has been a deceitful person; for a deceitful person he was before, when he shammed simply for the sake of warming himself at the fire.â Then he told them a story.

This seer, delighting in calm and restraint stands afflicted by the fear of winter, come now, please enter into this household, drive away all cold and anxiety.

This is no seer, delighting in calm and restraint, this is a monkey who ranges in tree branches. He is a spoiler, a provocateur, vulgar, if he comes inside he will surely spoil my home.

Thus did the Teacher discourse by way of showing how this man was not then only, but always, a deceitful person. This ended, he declared the Truths, and identified the JÄtaka, at the conclusion of the Truths some reached the First Path, some the Second, and yet some the Third, âThe hypocritical monk was the monkey, RÄhula was the son, and I was the ascetic myself.â

A young nobleman, living in SÄvatthi, gave his heart to the dispensation of the Treasures, 
The Buddha, the Dhamma, the Saá¹gha.
 and embraced the ascetic life. But one day, as he went his rounds in SÄvatthi, he happened to see a woman dressed in decorative apparel. Passion sprang up in his heart; he became disconsolate. When his teachers, counsellors and friends saw him thus, they at once asked him the cause. Seeing that he longed to return to the world, they said to one another, âMy friend, the Teacher can remove the defilements of those who are tormented by lust and the like, and by declaring the Truths, he brings them to enjoy the fruition of sanctity. Come, let us lead him to the Teacher.â


So to the Teacher they brought him. Said he, âWhy do you bring me this youth against his will, monks? They told him the reason. âIs this true,â he asked, âthat you are discontent, as they say?â He assented. The Teacher asked the reason, and he recounted what had happened. Said he, âO monk, it has happened before that these women have caused impurity to spring up even in pure beings whose defilements have been stayed by the power of Absorption. Why should not vain men like you be defiled, when defilement comes even to the pure? Even men of the highest repute have fallen into dishonour; how much more the impure! Shall not the wind that shakes Mount Sineru also stir a heap of old leaves? 
{2.272}
 This troubled the enlightened Buddha himself, sitting on his throne, and shall it not trouble such a one as you?â and at their request he told them a story.

By the cleansing of lustful thoughts, and by the sharpening of thought â not by adorning, not by blessings, and not by the fletcher.

Not by shooting from the ear, not by using a peacockâs feather â by defilements Iâm pierced in the heart with a fire in all my limbs.

I can see no wound on my body from where the blood might flow out, my heart is very careless, suffering is brought upon myself.

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he declared the Truths and identified the JÄtaka, at the conclusion of the Truths the discontented monk became an Arahat, and some entered the First Path, some the Second, and some the Third Paths, âÄnanda was the king, and I was the ascetic.â

 This story the Teacher told in Jetavana, about a passionate man. We learn that there was a monk who was full of bitterness. No matter how little was said to him, he fell into a rage and spoke roughly; showing wrath, hatred, and mistrust.


In the Dhamma Hall the monks discussed the matter. âFriend, how angry and bitter is monk So-and-so! He goes snapping about for all the world like salt in the fire. Though he has adopted this peaceful dispensation, yet he cannot even restrain his anger.â The Teacher heard this and sent a monk to fetch the man in question. âAre you really as passionate as they say?â he asked. The man said he was. Then the Teacher added, âThis is not the first time, monks, that this man has been passionate. He was just the same before,â and he told them a story.

Even today itâs in my mind, what you did to me for a handful of sesame, taking me by the arm you beat me with a stick.

Do you not take delight in life, brahmin, that you come by here, having taken ahold of my arms, three times you did batter me.

The noble one doing the ignoble, he who censors with a stick, this is right instruction, not hatred, so the wise do understand. 
[2.196]

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he declared the Truths; at the conclusion of the Truths the passionate monk attained the Fruit of the Third Path, and many others entered on the First, or Second, or Third Paths. âAt that time the passionate monk was the king; but the Teacher was I myself.â

 from all quarters the materials for houses which they were getting made for themselves. They were for ever asking, âGive us a man, give us somebody to do servantâs work,â and so forth. Everybody was annoyed at this begging and solicitation. So much annoyed were they, that at sight of these monks they were startled and scared away.


It happened that the venerable monk MahÄkassapa entered Äá¸·avÄ«, and traversed the place in quest of alms. The people, as soon as they saw the elder, ran away as before. 
Reading 
patipajjÄ«su
.
 After mealtime, having returned from his rounds, he summoned the monks, and thus addressed them, âOnce Äá¸·avÄ« was a good place for alms; why is it so poor now?â They told him the reason.


Now the Fortunate One was at the time dwelling at the AggÄá¸·ava shrine. The elder came to the Fortunate One, and told him all about it. The Teacher convened the monks touching this matter. 
{2.283}
 âI hear,â said he, âthat you are building houses and worrying everybody for help. Is this true?â They said it was. Then the Teacher rebuked them, adding these words, âEven in the serpent world, monks, full as it is of the seven precious stones, this kind of begging is distasteful to the serpents. How much more to men, from whom it is as hard to get a rupee as it is to skin a flint!â and he told a story of the past.

For me extensive and rich food and drinks are available because of this jewel, I wonât give it to you, you ask too much, nor will I come back to your hermitage.

Like a boy with a sharpened sword in hand, you scare me as you beg for this sapphire, I wonât give it to you, you ask too much, nor will I come back to your hermitage. 
[2.199] {2.285}

You shouldnât beg or desire what he holds dear, through excessive begging he is detested, the NÄga, whose jewel the brahmin begged, went away and he was surely not seen.

The Teacher added, âThus, monks, even in the world of NÄgas, where are the seven precious stones in plenty, begging is disliked by the NÄgas: how much more by men!â And, after teaching them this lesson, he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time, Änanda was the younger brother, but the elder was I myself.â

âGrass and the scum of gruel.â
 This story the Teacher told at Jetavana about the elder SÄriputta.


It once fell out that the Buddha had been spending the rainy season in SÄvatthi, and afterwards had been on alms pilgrimage. On his return, the inhabitants determined to welcome his homecoming and they made their gifts to the Buddha and his following. They posted the clerk who used to sound the 
[2.200]
 call for preaching, to distribute the monks amongst all comers, according to the number they wished to provide for.


There was one poor old woman, who had prepared one portion. The monks were assigned, some to this giver, some to that. At sunrise, the poor woman came to the clerk, and said: âGive a monk to me!â He answered, âI have already distributed them all; but elder SÄriputta is still in the monastery, and you may give your portion to him.â At this she was delighted, and waited by the gate of Jetavana until the elder came out. She gave him greeting, took his bowl from his hand, and leading him to her house, offered him a seat.


Many pious families heard a rumour that some old woman had got Elder SÄriputta to sit down at her door. Amongst those who heard it was king Pasenadi of Kosala. He at once sent her food of all sorts, together with a garment and a purse of a thousand pieces, with the request, âLet whoever is entertaining the monk, put on this robe, and spend this money, and thus entertain the elder.â As the king did, so did AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika, 
{2.287}
 the younger AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika, the lay sister VisÄkhÄ (a great lady), all sent the same: other families sent one hundred, two hundred or so, as their means allowed. Thus in a single day the old woman got as much as a hundred thousand pieces of money.


Our elder drank the broth which she gave him, and ate her food, and the rice that she cooked; then he thanked her, and so edified her that she was converted. Then he returned to the monastery.


In the Dhamma Hall, the monks discussed the elderâs goodness. âFriend, the Captain of the Dhamma has rescued an old housewife from poverty. He has been her mainstay. The food she offered he did not disdain to eat.â The Teacher entered, and asked what they were talking of now as they sat together. They told him. And he said: âThis is not the first time, monks, that SÄriputta has been the refuge of this old woman; nor the first time he did not disdain to eat the food she offered. He did the same before.â And he told a story of the past.

Having eaten grass as food, and eaten the scum of rice powder, this was your food previously, why do you not eat the same now? 
[2.202]

Where they do not know about a personâs birth or his discipline, many are there, MahÄbrahma, also the scum of rice powder.

But you must know me, I am the supreme horse of whatever kind, knowing and coming to know this, I will not eat your rice powder. 
{2.290}

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he declared the Truths, and identified the JÄtaka, and at the conclusion of the Truths many entered the First Path, or the Second, or the Third. âAt that time the old woman was the same, SÄriputta was the thoroughbred, Änanda was the king, and the horsedealer was I myself.â

The bird, who knew the measure in food, for as long as his lifetime lasted, supported his mother.

But because of swallowing food excessively, then he sank down right there, not knowing the measure.

Therefore knowing the measure in food is good, being without greed, by not knowing the measure they sink, knowing it they do not sink.

When we have parted with our wares, if we are fortunate and return in safety, we will come and wait upon you again.â Then they set off on their journey.


In a difficult part of their road they observed a disused well. There was no water in it that they could see, and they were athirst; so they resolved to dig deeper. As they dug, 
{2.295}
 they came upon successive layers of minerals of all sorts, from iron to lapis lazuli. This find contented them; they filled their wagons with these treasures, and got back safe to SÄvatthi. They stowed away the treasure which they had brought; and then bethought them, that having been so lucky they would give food to the Saá¹gha. So they invited the TathÄgata, and made him presents; and when they had respectfully greeted him, and sat down on one side, they recounted how they had found their treasure. Said he, âYou, good laymen, are content with your find, and accept your wealth and your livelihood with all moderation. But in other days there were men not content, immoderate, who refused to do as wise men advised them, and so lost their life.â And he told at their request a story of the past.

The Teacher, after telling this tale, after Fully Awakening, uttered the following lines:




1. JarÅ«dapÄnaá¹ khaá¹amÄnÄ, vÄá¹ijÄ udakatthikÄ,

He excels this world and the world of gods in wisdom.â


The Teacher entered, and asked what they were talking of now as they sat there. They told him. He answered, âThis is not the first time, monks, that the TathÄgata has been wise; he was the same before.â And he told a story of the past.

This one is not skilled in houses, this greedy one with wrinkled face, whatever has been made he spoils, such is the nature of this clan.

 This story the Teacher told during a stay at Jetavana, about a discontented monk.


We are told that this monk, in traversing SÄvatthi for his alms, saw a finely dressed woman and fell in love with her. Then the monks led him to the Dhamma Hall, and informed the Teacher that he was discontent. The Teacher asked whether it were true; and was answered, yes, it was. 
{2.311}
 âMonk,â said the Teacher, âwhen will you ever satisfy this lust, even while you are a householder? Such lust is as deep as the ocean, nothing can satisfy it. In former days there have been supreme monarchs, who attended by their retinue of men held sway over the four great continents encircled by two thousand isles, ruling even in the heaven of the Four Great Kings, even when they were kings of the gods in the Heaven of the Thirty Three, even in the abode of the Thirty Six Sakkas â even these failed to satisfy their lust, and died before they could do so; when will you be able to satisfy it?â And he told a story of the past.

As far as moon and sun  revolve in the directions, shining, radiant, all are servants of MandhÄtÄ, those whose breath depends upon earth.

Not through a rain of coins is satisfaction found in sense desires, the wise one knowing sense pleasures have little joy, much suffering.

But he does not find delight in divine pleasures, the disciple of the Perfect Sambuddha finds delight in cravingâs destruction. 
{2.314}

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he declared the Four Truths, and identified the JÄtaka, at the conclusion of the Truths the discontented monk and many others attained to the Fruit of the First Path. âAt that time, I was the great king MandhÄtÄ.â

âWhen all alone.â
 This story the Teacher told while living at Jetavana, about the gift of a thousand garments, how the venerable Änanda received five hundred garments from the women of the household of the king of Kosala, and five hundred from the king himself. The circumstances have been described above, in the SigÄlajÄtaka [Ja 152], of the Second Book. 
[This is another name for Ja 157 
Guá¹ajÄtaka
. I include the story here.]

This was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana how elder Änanda received a present of a thousand robes. The elder had been preaching to the ladies of the king of Kosalaâs palace as described above in the MahÄsÄrajÄtaka [Ja 92].


As he preached there in the manner described, a thousand robes, worth each a thousand pieces of money, were brought to the king. Of these the king gave five hundred to as many of his queens. The ladies put these aside and made them a present to our elder, and then the next day in their old ones went to the palace where the king took breakfast. The king remarked, âI gave you dresses worth a thousand pieces each. Why are you not wearing them?â âMy lord,â they said, âwe have given them to the elder.â âHas elder Änanda got them all?â he asked. They said: âYes, he has.â âThe Supreme Buddha,â said he, âallows only three robes. Änanda is doing a little trade in cloth, I suppose!â


He was angry with the elder; and after breakfast, visited him in his cell, and after greeting, sat down, with these words: âPray, sir, do my ladies learn or listen to your preaching?â


âYes, sire; they learn what they ought, and what they ought to hear, they hear.â


âOh, indeed. Do they only listen, or do they make you presents of upper garments or under-garments?â


âToday, sire, they have given me five hundred robes worth a thousand pieces each.â


âAnd you accepted them, sir?â


âYes, sire, I did.â


âWhy, sir, didnât the Teacher make some rule about three robes?â


âTrue, sire, for every monk three robes is the rule, speaking of what he uses for himself. But no one is forbidden to accept what is offered; and that is why I took them â to give them to monks whose robes are worn out.â


âBut when these monks get them from you, what do they do with their old ones?â


âMake them into a cloak.â


âAnd what about the old cloak?â


âThat they turn into a shirt.â


âAnd the old shirt?â


âThat serves for a coverlet.â


âThe old coverlet?â âBecomes a mat.â âThe old mat?â âA towel.â âAnd what about the old towel?â


âSire, it is not permitted to waste the gifts of the faithful; so they chop up the old towel into bits, and mix the bits with clay, which they use for mortar in building their houses.â


âA gift, sir, ought not to be destroyed, not even a towel.â


âWell, sir king, we destroy no gifts, but all are used somehow.â


This conversation pleased the king so much, that he sent for the other five hundred robes which remained, and gave them to the elder. Then, after receiving his thanks, he greeted the elder in solemn state, and went his way.


The elder gave the first five hundred robes to monks whose robes were worn out. But the number of his fellow monastics was just five hundred. One of these, a young monk, was very useful to the elder; sweeping out his cell, serving him with food and drink, giving him toothbrush and water for cleansing his mouth, looking after the privies, living rooms, and sleeping rooms, and doing all that was needed for hand, foot, or back. To him, as his by right for all his great service, the elder gave all the five hundred robes which he had received afterwards. The young monk in his turn distributed them among his fellow-students. These all cut them up, dyed them yellow as a kaá¹ikÄra flower; then dressed therein they waited upon the Teacher, greeted him, and sat down on one side.


âSir,â they asked, âis it possible for a holy disciple who has entered on the First Path to be a respecter of persons in his gifts?â âNo, monks, it is not possible for holy disciples to be respecters of persons in their gifts.â âSir, our spiritual teacher, the Treasurer of the Dhamma, gave five hundred robes, each worth a thousand pieces, to a young monk; and he has divided them amongst us.â âMonks, in giving these Änanda was no respecter of persons. That young fellow was a very useful servant; so he made the present to his own attendant for the sake of his service, for goodnessâ sake, and by right, thinking that one good turn deserves another, and with a wish to do what gratitude demands. In former days, as now, wise men acted on the principle one good turn deserves another.â And then, at their request, he told them a story of the past.

There is nothing done with wisdom in him, he is not your kin or companion, for what reason does TirÄ«á¹­avaccha, the one with three sticks, eat the choicest food? 
{2.317}

In distress, being defeated in war, being alone in an awful desert, he stretched out his hand when I was troubled, by that I escaped torment and suffering.

By him doing his duty I reached here, from deathâs realm to the world of the living, TirÄ«á¹­avaccha, dear, is worthy to receive, give him wealth, offer him an offering. 
{2.318}

Then the Teacher added, âWise men of old gave help too,â and having thus concluded his discourse, he identified the JÄtaka as follows, âÄnanda was the king, and I was the ascetic.â

He was, it was said, greedy after the Buddhist requisites and casting off all duties of master and pastor, entered SÄvatthi quite early, and after drinking excellent rice-gruel served with many a kind of solid food in the house of VisÄkhÄ, and after eating in the daytime various dainties, paddy, meat and boiled rice, not satisfied with this he went about thence to the house of Culla AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika, and the king of Kosala, and various others.


So one day a discussion was raised in the Dhamma Hall concerning his greediness. When the Teacher heard what they were discussing, he sent for that monk and asked him if it were true that he was greedy, and he said: âYes.â

Here again the Teacher told the monk, 
{2.319}
 âYou were greedy before, monk, as you are now; and in olden days for your greed you had your head cleft with a sword.â 
[The story must have had an alternative ending at one time. As it stands at present, the king is pleased with him, and praises his wisdom.]
 Then he told a story about the past.

For his benefit they go far, even to beg an enemy, I am the envoy to his belly, donât be angry, lord of cars.

By day and by night they come under his bellyâs control, young man, I am the envoy to his belly, donât be angry, lord of cars.

O brahmin, to you I give these red cows, a thousand cows together with their bull, what will an envoy not give an envoy, for we are surely an envoy to him.

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he declared the Truths and identified the JÄtaka, at the conclusion of the Truths the greedy monk reached the Fruit of the Third Path, and many others entered the other Paths. âThe greedy man is the same in both stories, and I was king Bhojanasuddhika.â

 This story the Teacher told at Jetavana, about some monks who made offering of garlands under Änandaâs tree. The circumstances will be given in the KÄliá¹gabodhijÄtaka [Ja 479].

This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana about worship of the Bodhi tree performed by elder Änanda.


When the TathÄgata had set forth on pilgrimage, for the purpose of gathering in those who were ripe for conversion, the citizens of SÄvatthi proceeded to Jetavana, their hands full of garlands and fragrant wreaths, and finding no other place to show their reverence, laid them by the gateway of the perfumed chamber and went off. This caused great rejoicings. But AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika got to hear of it; and on the return of the TathÄgata visited elder Änanda and said to him, âThis monastery, sir, is left unprovided while the TathÄgata goes on pilgrimage, and there is no place for the people to do reverence by offering fragrant wreaths and garlands. Will you be so kind, sir, as to tell the TathÄgata of this matter, and learn from him whether or not it is possible to find a place for this purpose.â The other, quite willingly, did so, asking, âHow many shrines are there?â âThree, Änanda.â âWhich are they?â âShrines for a relic of the body, a relic of use or wear, a relic of memorialâ âCan a shrine be made, sir, during your life?â âNo, Änanda, not a body-shrine; that kind is made when a Buddha enters NibbÄna. A shrine of memorial is improper because the connection depends on the imagination only. But the great Bodhi tree used by the Buddhas is fit for a shrine, be they alive or be they dead.â âSir, while you are away on pilgrimage the great monastery of Jetavana is unprotected, and the people have no place where they can show their reverence. Shall I plant a seed of the great Bodhi tree before the gateway of Jetavana?â âBy all means so do, Änanda, and that shall be as it were an abiding place for me.â


The elder told this to AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika, and VisÄkhÄ, and the king. Then at the gateway of Jetavana he cleared out a pit for the Bodhi tree to stand in, and said to the chief elder, MoggallÄna, âI want to plant a Bodhi tree in front of Jetavana. Will you get me a fruit of the great Bodhi tree?â The elder, willingly, passed through the air to the platform under the Bodhi tree. He placed in his robe a fruit that was dropping from its stalk but had not reached the ground, brought it back, and delivered it to Änanda. The elder informed the king of Kosala that he was to plant the Bodhi tree that day. So in the evening time the king came with a great concourse, bringing all things necessary; then also AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika and VisÄkhÄ came and a crowd of the faithful besides.


In the place where the Bodhi tree was to be planted the elder had placed a golden jar, and in the bottom of it was a hole; all was filled with earth moistened with fragrant water. He said: âO king, plant this seed of the Bodhi tree,â giving it to the king. But the king, thinking that his kingdom was not to be in his hands for ever, and that AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika ought to plant it, passed the seed to AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika, the great merchant. Then AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika stirred up the fragrant soil and dropped it in. The instant it dropped from his hand, before the very eyes of all, it sprang up as broad as a plough-head a Bodhi sapling, fifty cubits tall; on the four sides and upwards shot forth five great branches of fifty cubits in length, like the trunk. So stood the tree, a very lord of the forest already; a mighty miracle! The king poured round the tree jars of gold and of silver, in number eight hundred, filled with scented water, beauteous with a great quantity of blue water-lilies, and caused to be set there a long line of vessels all full, and a seat he had made of the seven precious things, golden dust he had sprinkled about it, a wall was built round the precincts, he erected a gate chamber of the seven precious things. Great was the honour paid to it.


The elder, approaching the TathÄgata, said to him, âSir, for the peopleâs good, accomplish under the Bodhi tree which I have planted that height of Attainment to which you attained under the great Bodhi tree.â âWhat is this you say, Änanda?â replied he. âThere is no other place can support me, if I sit there and attain to that which I attained in the enclosure of the great Bodhi tree.â âSir,â said Änanda, âI pray you for the good of the people, to use this tree for the rapture of Attainment, in so far as this spot of ground can support the weight.â The Teacher used it during one night for the rapture of Attainment.


The elder informed the king, and all the rest, and called it by the name of the Bodhi Festival.

This tree was called 
[2.223]
 Änandaâs tree, because Änanda planted it. 
[In the story AnÄthapiá¹á¸aka does the actual planting, monks not being allowed to dig the earth. We may understand it as being due to Änanda that the tree was planted.]
 All JambudÄ«pa heard tell how the elder had planted this tree by the gate of Jetavana.


Some monks who lived in the country thought they would make offerings before Änandaâs tree. They journeyed to Jetavana, did their devotions to the Teacher, and next day wended their way to SÄvatthi, to the Lotus Street; but not a garland could they get. So they told Änanda, how they had wished to make an offering to the tree, but that not a garland was to be had in all the Lotus Street. The elder promised to fetch some; so he went off to the Lotus Street, and returned with many handfuls of blue lotus, which he gave them. With these they made their offering to the tree.


When the monks got wind of this, they began discussing the elderâs merits in the Dhamma Hall, âFriend, some brothers of little merit from the country could not get a single nosegay in the Lotus Bazaar; but the elder went and fetched them some.â The Teacher entered, and asked what they were talking of as they sat there; and they told him. Said he, 
{2.322}
 âMonks, this is not the first time that a clever tongue has gained a garland for clever speaking; it was the same before.â 
[Note that nothing was said in the Introduction to indicate that Ven Änanda had used clever speaking to gain the lotuses for the monks, so the story hardly fits.]
 And he told them a story.

Just like head hair and beard which are cut off, grow back, so will your nose grow, when begged, give us a lotus.

Just as in the autumn seeds sewn in the field grow, so will your nose grow, when begged give us a lotus.

Both of these talk nonsense, though he give lotuses, whether they say or donât say, there is no nose grown, friend, give me lotuses, I am begging this ask. 
[2.224] {2.323}

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he identified the JÄtaka, âThe boy who got the lotus was I myself.â

In olden days, even wise men could not guard their own daughters; while they stood holding their fathersâ hand, without their fathersâ knowing, because of defilements she ran away with a man,â and he told them a story.

If his hand is soft, and his elephant well-trained, should it rain in darkness, then surely it will be.

Soft talk is not enough, like rivers hard to fill, knowing this they sink, he should avoid from afar.

 This story the Teacher told at Jetavana, also about a discontented monk. The Teacher had him brought into the Dhamma Hall, and asked if it were true that he was discontent. Yes, said he, it was. âWomen,â said the Teacher, âin olden days made even believing souls do wrong.â Then he told a story.

He came by his own super power, not breaking through the waters, going and mixing with a woman he sunk into the great sea.

Temptress, great deceiver, upsetter of the spiritual life, knowing this they sink, he should avoid from afar.

Those women frequent him, through desire or through wealth, like a fire in that place, they quickly burn him up. 
[2.229]

When this discourse was ended, the Teacher declared the Truths; now at the conclusion of the Truths the discontented monk became established in the Fruit of the First Path. âAt that time,â said he, âI was myself the youth that had never had anything to do with women.â

## Analysis
In the present the Buddha goes to teach in one village where there was a young and very rich gentleman, who, when he heard the Buddha teach became a monk. When one day they were crossing a river the Buddha asked him to show the palace he had lived in in a previous life, which had sunk under the waters. He did so, and the Buddha then told the story of his previous fame and fortune.


The Bodhisatta = (the King of the Devas) Sakka,

## Full Story
â âTwas king PanÄda.â
 This story the Teacher told when he was settled on the bank of the Ganges, about the miraculous power of elder Bhaddaji.


On one occasion, when the Teacher had passed the rains at SÄvatthi, he thought he would show kindness to a young gentleman named Bhaddaji. So with all the monks who were with him, he made his way to the city of Bhaddiya, and stayed three months in JÄtiyÄ Grove, waiting until the young man should mature and perfect his knowledge. Now young Bhaddaji was a magnificent person, the only son of a rich merchant in Bhaddiya, with a fortune of eight hundred millions. He had three houses for the three seasons, in each of which he stayed four months; and after spending this period in one of them, he used to migrate with all his kith and kin to another in the greatest pomp. On these occasions all the town was eager to see the young manâs magnificence; and between these houses used to be erected seats in circles on circles and tiers above tiers.


When the Teacher had been there three months, he informed the townspeople that he intended to leave. Begging him to wait until the morrow, the townsfolk on the following day collected magnificent gifts for the Buddha and his attendant monks; and set up a pavilion in the midst of the town, decorating it and laying out seats; then they announced that the hour had come. The Teacher 
[2.230]
 with his company went and took their seats there. Everybody gave generously to them. After the meal was over, the Teacher in a voice sweet as honey returned thanks to them.


At this moment, young Bhaddaji was passing from one of his residences to another. 
{2.332}
 But that day not a soul came to see his splendour; only his own people were about him. So he asked his people how it was. Usually all the city was eager to see him pass from house to house; circles on circles and tiers above tiers the seats were built; but just then there was nobody but his own followers! What could be the reason?


The reply was, âMy lord, the Supreme Buddha has been spending three months near the town, and this day he leaves. He has just finished his meal, and is holding a discourse. All the town is there listening to his words.â


âOh, very well, we will go and hear him too,â said the young man. So, in a blaze of ornaments, with his crowd of followers about him, he went and stood on the skirt of the crowd; as he heard the discourse, he threw off all his defilements, and attained to supreme fruition and became an Arahat.


The Teacher, addressing the merchant of Bhaddiya, said: âSir, your son, in all his splendour, while hearing my discourse has become an Arahat; this very day he should either embrace the ascetic life, or enter NibbÄna.â


âSir,â replied he, âI do not wish my son to enter NibbÄna. Admit him to the monastic order; this done, come with him to my house tomorrow.â


The Fortunate One accepted this invitation; he took the young gentleman to the monastery, admitted him to the Saá¹gha, and afterward to the lower and higher ordinations. For a week the youthâs parents showed generous hospitality to him.


After remaining these seven days, the Teacher went on alms pilgrimage, taking the young man with him, and arrived at a village called Koá¹­i. The villagers of Koá¹­i gave generously to the Buddha and his followers. At the end of this meal, the Teacher began to express his thanks. While this was being done, the young gentleman went outside the village, and by a landing-place of the Ganges he sat down under a tree, and plunged in Absorption, thinking that he would rise as soon as the Teacher should come. When the elders of greatest age approached, he did not rise, but he rose as soon as the Teacher came. The unconverted folk were angry because he behaved as though he were a monk of long standing, not rising up even when he saw the eldest monks approach.


The villagers constructed rafts. This done, 
{2.333}
 the Teacher asked where Bhaddaji was. âThere he is, sir.â âCome, Bhaddaji, come aboard my raft.â The elder rose, and followed him to his raft. When they were in mid-river, the Teacher asked him a question.


âBhaddaji, where is the palace you lived in when Great PanÄda was king?â âHere, under the water,â was the reply. The worldly monks said one to the other, âElder Bhaddaji is declaring his knowledge!â 
For an explanation of this phrase, 
aÃ±Ã±aá¹ vyÄkaroti
, see 
MahÄvagga
 r. v. 19 with the translatorsâ note (
Sacred Books of the East
, 
Vinaya Texts
 ii. p. 10).
 Then the Teacher bade him disperse the doubt of his fellow-students.


In a moment, the elder, with a bow to his Teacher, moving by his Supernormal Powers, took the whole pile of the palace on his finger, and rose in the air bearing the palace with him (it covered a space of twenty-five leagues); then he made a hole in it and showed himself to the present inhabitants of the palace below, and tossed the building above the water first one league, then two, then three. Then those who had been his kinsfolk in this former existence, who had now become fish or turtles, water-snakes or frogs, because they loved the palace so much, and had come to life in the very same place, wriggled out of it when it rose up, and tumbled over and over into the water again. When the Teacher saw this, he said: âBhaddaji, your relations are in trouble.â At his Teacherâs words the elder let the palace go, and it sank to the place where it had been before.


The Teacher passed to the further side of the Ganges. Then they prepared 
[2.231]
 him a seat just on the river bank. On the seat prepared for the Buddha, he sat, like the sun fresh risen pouring forth his rays. Then the monks asked him when it was that elder Bhaddaji had lived in that palace. The Teacher answered, âIn the days of king Great PanÄda,â and went on to tell them a story of the past.

The king whose name was PanÄda, had a palace made out of gold, which was sixteen lengths across, and a thousand-fold in height, they say.

A thousand sections, a hundred floors, adorned with emerald flags, the musicians danced there, six thousand divided in seven troupes.

At that time this was certainly so, just as Bhaddaji has said, at that time I was Sakka, Lord of Devas, now I am your steward. 
{2.335}

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he identified the JÄtaka, âBhaddaji was the MahÄpanÄda, and I was Sakka.â

## Full Story
âHe for whose sake.â
 
[2.233]
 This story the Teacher told at Jetavana, about a certain landowner.


At SÄvatthi, we learn, a handsome woman saw this man, who was also handsome, and fell in love. The passion within her was like a fire burning her body through and through. She lost her senses, both of body and of mind; she cared nothing for food; she only lay down hugging the frame of the bedstead.


Her friends and handmaidens asked her what troubled her at heart that she lay hugging the bedstead; what was the matter, they wished to know. The first few times she answered nothing; but as they continued pressing her, she told them what it was.


âDonât worry,â they said, âweâll bring him to you,â and they went and had a talk with the man. At first he refused, but by their much asking he at last consented. They got his promise to come at a certain hour on a fixed day, and told the woman.


She prepared her chamber, and dressed herself in her finery, and sat on the bed waiting until he came. He sat down beside her. Then a thought came into her mind. 
{2.338}
 âIf I accept his advances at once, and make myself cheap, my pride will be humbled. To let him have his will the very first day he comes would be out of place. I will be capricious today, and afterwards I will give way.â So no sooner had he touched her, and begun to dally, she caught his hands, and spoke roughly to him, bidding him go away, as she did not want him. He shrank back angrily, and went off home.


When the women found out what she had done, and that the man had gone off, they reproached her. âHere you are,â they said, âin love with somebody, and lie down refusing to take nourishment; we had great difficulty in persuading the man, but at last we bring him; and then you have nothing to say to him!â She told them why it was, and they went off; warning her that she would get talked about.


The man never even came to look at her again. When she found she had lost him, she would take no nourishment, and soon died. When the man heard of her death, he took a quantity of flowers, scents, and perfumes, and went to Jetavana, where he saluted the Teacher and sat on one side.


The Teacher asked him, âHow is it, lay brother, that we never see you here?â He told him the whole story, adding that he had avoided waiting on the Buddha all this time for shame. Said the Teacher, âLayman, on this occasion the woman sent for you through her passion, and then would have nothing to do with you and sent you away angry; and just so in olden days, she fell in love with wise persons, sent for them, and when they came refused to have anything to do with them, and thus plagued them and sent them back again.â Then at his request the Teacher told a story of the past.

That by which you grew thin, yellow, and did not take delight in food, that master, he has returned, why at this time do you run away?

If at the beginning itself whatâs called intimacy arises, for women their fame is lost, therefore, my dear, I do run away.

Not desiring to come to one born in a renowned family, she will grieve for a long time, like BhaddalÄ« grieved for VÄtagga.

When this discourse was ended, the Teacher declared the Truths and identified the JÄtaka, at the conclusion of the Truths, this landowner entered on the Fruit of the First Path, âThis woman was the female ass, and I was VÄtagga.â

âGold-clawed creature.â
 
 {2.341}
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana, about a certain woman.


We are told that a certain landowner of SÄvatthi, with his wife, was on a journey into the country for the purpose of collecting debts, when he fell among robbers. Now the wife was very beautiful and charming. The robber chief was so taken by her that he purposed killing the husband to get her. But the woman was good and virtuous, a devoted wife. She fell at the robberâs feet, crying, âMy lord, if you kill my husband for love of me, I will take poison, or stop my breath, and kill myself too! With you I will not go. Do not kill my husband uselessly!â In this way she begged him off.


They both got back safe to SÄvatthi. Then it occurred to them as they passed the monastery in Jetavana, that they would visit it and salute the Teacher. So to the perfumed cell they went, and after salutation sat down on one side. The Teacher asked them where they had been. âTo collect our debts,â they replied. âDid your journey pass off without mishap?â he asked next. âWe were captured by robbers on the way,â said the husband, âand the chief wanted to murder me; but my wife here begged for me, and I owe my life to her.â Then said the Teacher, âYou are not the only one, layman, whose life she has saved. In days of yore she saved the lives of other wise men.â And then at his request the Teacher told a story of the past.

âHornÃ©d creature having extended eyes, bones for skin, lying in water, hairless, overcome by him I cry wretchedly, you should not abandon me, dear as life.â

âDear sir, I will not abandon you, elephant of sixty years, by the four quarters on the earth you are the one most dear to me.â 
[2.237]

âThose crabs in the ocean, and in the Ganges and the YamunÄ, of these youâre the best born in water, through my cries free my husband.â

When this discourse was ended, the Teacher declared the Truths, and identified the JÄtaka, at the conclusion of the Truths both husband and wife attained the Fruit of the First Path.

âBest of all.â
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling in the country near Dakkhiá¹Ägiri, about a gardenerâs son.


After the rains, the Teacher left Jetavana, and went on alms pilgrimage in the 
[2.238]
 district about Dakkhiá¹Ägiri. A layman invited the Buddha and his company, and made them sit down in his grounds while he gave them rice and cakes. Then he said: âIf any of the masters care to see over the grounds, they might go along with the gardener,â and he ordered the gardener to supply them with any fruit they might fancy.


By and by they came upon a bare spot. âWhat is the reason,â they asked, âthat this spot is bare and treeless?â âThe reason is,â answered the gardener, âthat a certain gardenerâs son, who had to water the saplings, thought he had better give them water in proportion to the length of the roots; so he pulled them all up to see, and watered them accordingly. The result was that the place became bare.â


The monks returned, and told this to their Teacher. Said he, âNot only now has the lad destroyed a plantation; he did just the same before,â and then he told them a story.

âHe who was esteemed as the best of all of them, such is his wisdom, why ask about other folk?â

âTruly such are you, Brahma, although unknowing, you reproach me, without having seen the root, how can we know which tree is grounded?â 
[2.239]

âI do not reproach you or any other monkeys in the woods, Vissasena is blameworthy, and those whose aim is to grow trees.â 
{2.347}

When this discourse was ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka, âThe lad who destroyed the park was the monkey chief, and I was the wise man.â

## Full Story
âThose who are dowered.â
 This story the Teacher told while living in Jetavana about one SujÄtÄ, a daughter-in-law of AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika, daughter of the great merchant DhanaÃ±jaya, and youngest sister of VisÄkhÄ.


We are told that she entered the house of AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika full of haughtiness, thinking how great a family she had come from, and she was obstinate, violent, passionate, and cruel; refused to do her part towards her new father and mother, or her husband; and went about the house with harsh words and hard blows for everyone.


One day, the Teacher and five hundred monks visited AnÄthapiá¹á¸ikaâs house, and took their seats. The great merchant sat beside the Fortunate One, hearkening to his discourse. At the same time SujÄtÄ happened to be scolding the servants.


The Teacher ceased speaking, and asked what that noise was. The merchant explained that it was his rude daughter-in-law; that she did not behave properly towards her husband or his parents, she gave no alms, and had no good points; faithless and unbelieving, she went about the house scolding day and night. The Teacher bade send for her.


The woman came, and after saluting the Teacher, she stood on one side. Then the Teacher addressed her thus:


âSujÄtÄ, there are seven kinds of wife a man may have; of which sort are you?â She replied, âSir, you speak too shortly for me to understand; please explain.â âWell,â said the Teacher, âlisten attentively,â and he uttered the following verses:

âOne is bad-hearted, nor compassionates

The good; loves others, but her lord she hates.

Destroying all that her lordâs wealth obtains, 
It is not clear whether 
vadhena kÄ«tassa
 is âthe thing bought by his wealth,â or the âpersonâ; probably both.


This wife the title of Destroyer gains. 
[2.240]

Whateâer the husband gets for her by trade,

Or skilled profession, or the farmerâs spade, 
{2.348}

She tries to filch a little out of it.

For such a wife the title Thief is fit.


Careless of duty, lazy, passionate,

Greedy, foul-mouthed, and full of wrath and hate,

Tyrannical to all her underlings â

All this the title High and Mighty brings.


Who evermore compassionates the good,

Cares for her husband as a mother would,

Guards all the wealth her husband may obtain â

This wife the title Motherly will gain.


She who respects her husband in the way

Young sisters reverence to elders pay,

Modest, obedient to her husbandâs will,

The Sisterly is this wifeâs title still.


She whom her husbandâs sight will always please

As friend that friend after long absence sees,

High-bred and virtuous, giving up her life

To him â this one is called the Friendly wife.


Calm when abused, afraid of violence,

No passion, full of dogged patience,

True-hearted, bending to her husbandâs will,

Slave is the title given to her still.â 
{2.349}

âThese, SujÄtÄ, are the seven wives a man may have. Three of these, the Destructive wife, the Dishonest wife, and Madam High and Mighty are reborn in hell; the other four in the Fifth Heaven.

âThey who are called Destroyer in this life,

The High and Mighty, or the Thievish wife,

Being angry, wicked, disrespectful, go

Out of the body into hell below.


They who are called the Friendly in this life,

Motherly, Sisterly, or Slavish wife,

By virtue and their long self-mastery

Pass into heaven when their bodies die.â

While the Teacher was explaining these seven kinds of wives, SujÄtÄ attained to the Fruit of the First Path; and when the Teacher asked to which class she belonged, she answered, âI am a slave, sir!â and respectfully saluting the TathÄgata, gained pardon of him.


Thus by one admonition the Teacher tamed the shrew; and after the meal, when he had declared their duties amidst the Saá¹gha, he entered his scented chamber.


Now the monks gathered together in the Dhamma Hall, and sang the Teacherâs praises. âFriend, by a single admonition the Teacher has tamed a shrew, and raised her to Fruition of the First Path!â The Teacher entered, and asked what they were talking of as they sat together. They told him. Said he, âMonks, this is not the first time that I have tamed SujÄtÄ by a single admonition.â And he proceeded to tell a story of the past.

Though being endowed with beauty, pleasing and good-looking, those with rough voices are not dear, in this world or the next.

Surely you must see this one, who is black, ugly, mottled with spots, the cuckoo, because of his soft voice, is dear to many creatures.

Therefore for the one of kind voice, a wise speaker, and not haughty, who explains both the Dhamma and its meaning, his is a sweet speech.

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he thus identified the JÄtaka, âSujÄtÄ was the mother of the king of Benares, and I was the king himself.â

âThe owl is king.â
 This story the Teacher told while living at Jetavana, about a quarrel between crows and owls.


At the period in question, the crows used to eat owls during the day, and at night, the owls flew about, nipping off the heads of the crows as they slept, and thus killing them. There was a certain monk who lived in a cell on the outskirts of Jetavana. When the time came for sweeping, there used to be a quantity of crowsâ heads to throw away, which had dropped from the tree, enough to fill seven or eight pots. He told this to the monks.


In the Dhamma Hall the monks began to talk about it. âFriend, monk So-and-so finds ever so many crowsâ heads to throw away every day in the place where he lives!â 
{2.352}
 The Teacher came in, and asked what they were talking about as they sat together. They told him. They went on to ask how long it was since the crows and owls fell quarrelling. The Teacher replied, âSince the time of the first age of the world,â and then he told them a story.

Over all my relatives, it seems, the owl has been made ruler, if I have permission of my relatives, I would speak one word.

Speak, friend, you have permission, all that is Dhamma and meaningful, although these birds are young, theyâre endowed with wisdom and brilliance.

Good luck to you, but I do not like the anointing of the owl, look at his face when not angry, what will it be when made angry?

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he declared the Truths and identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time, the wild goose chosen for king was I myself.â

## Full Story
âThis well a forest-ascetic.â
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Isipatana, about a jackal that fouled a well.


We learn that a jackal used to foul a well where the monks used to draw water, and then used to make off. One day the novices pelted him with clods of earth, and made it uncomfortable for him. After that he never came to look at the place again.


The monks heard of this and began to discuss it in the Dhamma Hall. âFriend, the jackal that used to foul our well has never come near it since the novices chased him away with clods!â The Teacher came in, and asked what they were talking about now as they sat together. They told him. Then he replied, âMonks, this is not the first time that this jackal fouled a well. He did the same before,â and then he told a story of the past. 
[2.244]

For the seer in the wilds who lives austere for many nights, dear friend, why did you spoil this well which was made with difficulty? 
{2.355}

This is the nature of jackals, having drunk I must urinate, it is our fathersâ and grandfathersâ nature, you should not blame us.

Those for whom such is natural, what would be unnatural? Donât let me see your natural or unnatural any time!

When the Teacher had ended this discourse he declared the Truths and identified the JÄtaka, âThe jackal that fouled the well is the same in both cases; and I was the chief of the ascetic band.â

## Full Story
âWhat time the nearness.â
 
{2.356}
 This story the Teacher told while living at Jetavana, about KokÄlika. 
KokÄlika was a follower of Devadatta.
 The circumstances of this story will be given in the Thirteenth Book, and the TakkÄriyajÄtaka [Ja 481].

During one rainy season the two chief disciples, desiring to leave the multitude and to dwell apart, took leave of the Teacher, and went into the kingdom where KokÄlika was. They repaired to the residence of KokÄlika, and said this to him, âMonk KokÄlika, since for us it is delightful to dwell with you, and for you to dwell with us, we would abide here three months.â âHow,â said the other, âwill it be delightful for you to dwell with me?â They answered, âIf you tell not a soul that the two chief disciples are dwelling here, we shall be happy, and that will be our delight in dwelling with you.â âAnd how is it delightful for me to dwell with you?â âWe will teach the Dhamma to you for three months in your home, and we will discourse to you, and that will be your delight in dwelling with us.â âDwell here, monks,â said he, âso long as you will,â and he allotted a pleasant residence to them. There they dwelt in the fruition of the Attainments, and no man knew of their dwelling in that place.


When they had thus past the rains they said to him, âMonk, now we have dwelt with you, and we will go to visit the Teacher,â and asked his leave to go. He agreed, and went with them on the rounds for alms in a village over against the place where they were. After their meal the elders departed from the village. KokÄlika leaving them, turned back and said to the people, âLay brethren, you are like brute animals. Here the two chief disciples have been dwelling for three months in the monastery opposite, and you knew nothing of it: now they are gone.â âWhy did you not tell us, sir?â the people asked.


Then they took ghee and oil and medicines, raiment and clothes, and approached the elders, saluting them and saying: âPardon us, sirs we knew not you were the chief disciples, we have learned it but today by the words of the venerable monk KokÄlika. Pray have compassion on us, and receive these medicines and clothes.â KokÄlika went after the elders with them, for he thought: âThe elders are frugal, and content with little; they will not accept these things, and then they will be given to me.â But the elders, because the gift was offered at the instigation of a monk, neither accepted the things themselves nor had them given to KokÄlika. The lay folk then said: âSirs, if you will not accept these, come here once again to bless us.â The elders promised, and proceeded to the Teacherâs presence.


Now KokÄlika was angry, because the elders neither accepted those things themselves, nor had them given to him. The elders, however, having remained a short while with the Teacher, each chose five hundred monks as their following, and with these thousand monks went on pilgrimage seeking alms, as far as KokÄlikaâs country. The lay folk came out to meet them, and led them to the same monastery, and showed them great honour day by day.


Great was the store given them of clothes and of medicines. Those monks who went out with the elders dividing the garments gave of them to all the monks which had come, but to KokÄlika gave none, neither did the elders give him any. Getting no clothes KokÄlika began to abuse and revile the elders, âSÄriputta and MoggallÄna are full of wicked desire; they would not accept before what was offered them, but these things they do accept. There is no satisfying them, they have no regard for another.â But the elders, perceiving that the man was harbouring evil on their account, set out with their followers to depart; nor would they return, not though the people begged them to stay yet a few days longer.


Then a young monk said: âWhere shall the elders stay, laymen? Your own particular elder does not wish them to stay here.â Then the people went to KokÄlika, and said: âSir, we are told you do not wish the elders to stay here. Go to! Either appease them and bring them back, or away with you and live elsewhere!â

Here again KokÄlika said: âI will bring SÄriputta and MoggallÄna back with me.â So having left KokÄlikaâs country, he travelled to Jetavana, greeted the Teacher, and went on to the 
[2.245]
 elders. He said: âFriends, the citizens of KokÄlikaâs country summon you. Let us go there!â âGo yourself, friend, we wonât,â was the answer. After this refusal he went away by himself.


The monks got talking about this in the Dhamma Hall. âFriend! KokÄlika canât live either with SÄriputta and MoggallÄna, or without them! He canât put up with their room or their company!â The Teacher came in, and enquired what they were all talking about together. They told him. He said: âIn olden days, just as now, KokÄlika couldnât live with SÄriputta and MoggallÄna, or without them.â And he told a story.

Through association with a bad friend, security decreases, the wise one should guard his predominance like he should guard his eyes.

Through association with a good friend, security increases, the wise one should do all his duties in life for one like himself.

Come, tigers, please turn back, return to the great wood, donât cut the wood, bereft of tigers, do not let there be tigers without a wood.

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he declared the Truths and identified the JÄtaka, âKokÄlika was then the foolish DevatÄ, SÄriputta the lion, MoggallÄna the tiger, and the wise DevatÄ was I myself.â

## Full Story
What is that pile of food
. 
{2.359}
 
The Teacher taught this, while living at Jetaâs Wood, concerning the settling of a quarrel between two ministers of the king of Kosala. The Birth Story of the Present has been told in the Section with Two Verses. 
Specifically in Ja 154 
Uraga
jÄtaka
, which I include here.


It seems the king of Kosala had two ministers, who were attendants and leaders of a guild, who, whenever one saw the other, quarrelled. They naturally became enemies in the whole city. Neither the king, nor relatives, were able to reconcile them.


Then one day in the morning the Teacher, while looking round to see who was capable of being released from bondage, saw these two had the supporting conditions for the Path of Stream-Entry.


And on another day he entered SÄvatthÄ« alone for alms, and stood at the door of one of their houses. After coming out, taking the bowl, leading the Teacher inside the residence, he had him sit down on the prepared seat. 


While sitting there the Teacher taught about the advantages ofdeveloping loving-kindness, and when he knew his mind was ready, he explained the truths, and at the end of the truths he was established in the Fruit of Stream-Entry. 


The Teacher, knowing he had the state of Stream-Entry, after making him take the bowl, rose and went to the door of the otherâs house. 


After he had come out, he paid respects to the Teacher, saying: âEnter, venerable sir,â and after entering he made him sit down. The other minister also took the bowl, and entered together with the Teacher. The Teacher praised the eleven advantages of loving-kindness, and when he knew his mind was ready, he explained the truths, and at the end of the truths he was also established in the Fruit of Stream-Entry. 


These two both having Stream-Entry, confessed their offences to each other, and after asking forgiveness, and being reconciled and on good terms, their intentions were one and the same. 


That very day face to face with the Fortunate One they ate together. 


The Teacher, after he had finshed the meal duties, returned to the monastery. 


Carrying a lot of garlands, incense, creams, and ghee, honey and molasses, they entered together with the Teacher. 


The Teacher, having explained the duties to the monastic Saá¹gha, 
{2.13}
 and given advice, entered into the Perfumed Hut. 


The next morning, amongst the monastics in the Dhamma Hall, this talk about the Teacherâs virtues arose: âFriends, the Teacher tames the untamed, these two ministers were striving for a long time, but neither was the king able to bring about reconciliation, and nor were their relatives, friends and so on able, but in just one day the Realised One tamed them.â


After the Teacher came, he asked: âAnd what, monastics, are you discussing while sitting here?â


âNamely, this,â they said. 


âNow, monastics, I have reconciled whese two people, and before I also reconclied them,â and after saying that, he delivered a story about the past.

Who is that with a pile of food, like a brahmin with a handful? Where did you wander to almsfood? What funeral did you attend?

I am a foolish monkey, having touched the untouchable, if you release me, bless you, free, Iâll go to the mountain.

The Kassapas are turtles, and the Koá¹á¸aÃ±Ã±as are monkeys, Kassapa, free up Koá¹á¸aÃ±Ã±a, from having intercourse with you.

The Teacher after delivering the Dhamma teaching, and revealing the truths, made the connection of the JÄtaka: âAt that time the two ministers were the turtle and the monkey, and I was the ascetic.â

âKnowing your faith.â
 
[2.251]
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling in Jetavana, about a monk that killed a wild goose. 
{2.366}
 Two monks, great friends, who came from SÄvatthi, and had embraced the ascetic life, after taking the higher orders used generally to go about together. One day they came to the river AciravatÄ«. After a bath, they stood on the sand, basking in the sunlight and talking pleasantly together. At this moment two wild geese flew over their heads. One of the young fellows picked up a stone. âIâm going to hit that goose bird in the eye!â says he. âYou canât,â says the other. âThat I can,â says the first, âand not only that â I can hit either this eye or that eye, as I please.â âNot you!â says the other. âLook here, then!â says the first; and picking up a three-cornered stone, threw it after the bird. The bird turned its head on hearing the pebble whizz through the air. Then the other, seizing a round pebble, threw it so that it hit the near eye and came out of the other. The goose with a loud cry turned over and over and fell at their very feet.


The monks who were standing about saw what had occurred, and ran up, reproaching him. âWhat a shame,â they said, âthat you, who have embraced such a dispensation as ours, should take the life of a living creature!â They made him go before the TathÄgata with them. âIs what they say true?â asked the Teacher. âHave you really taken the life of a living creature?â âYes, sir,â replied the monk. âMonk,â said he, âhow is it that you have done this thing, after embracing so great a dispensation? Wise men of old, before the Buddha appeared, though they lived in the world, and the worldly life is impure, felt remorse about mere trifles; but you, who have embraced this great dispensation, have no scruples. A monk ought to hold himself in control in deed, word, and thought.â Then he told a story.

Knowing your faith and your virtue, ruler of the people, we did exchange gold in Kaliá¹ga with the collyrium-coloured one. 
{2.370}

Dependents or non-dependents, he who comes here for my sake, all of them are acceptable, this was my former teachersâ word.

This elephant I give to you, brahmin, suitable, useful for a king, famous, decorated, covered with golden chains, with a driver, go wherever you will. 
{2.371}

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he declared the Truths, and explained the JÄtaka tale. At the conclusion of the Truths, some entered the First Path, some the Second, some entered the Third, and some became Arahats. And the JÄtaka tale is thus explained:

Uppalavaá¹á¹Ä was the courtesan,

Puá¹á¹a the porter, and the driver was


KaccÄna; Kolita, the measurer;

The rich man, SÄriputta; he who drove


The chariot, Anuruddha; and the priest

Was Kassapa the elder; he that was


The viceroy, now is Nandapaá¹á¸ita;

RÄhulaâs mother has the queen-consort,


The queen-mother was MÄyÄ; and the king

Was the Bodhisatta. Thus is it clear.

## Full Story
âWhy do you patiently.â
 
 {2.385}
 This story the Teacher told at Jetavana, about a certain impertinent monkey. At SÄvatthi, we are told, was a tame monkey in a certain family; and it ran into the elephantâs stable, and perching on the back of a virtuous elephant, voided excrement, and began to walk up and down. The elephant, being both virtuous and patient, did nothing. But one day in this elephantâs place stood a wicked young one. The monkey thought it was the same, and climbed upon its back. The elephant seized him in his trunk, and dashing him to the ground, trod him to pieces.


This became known in the meeting of the Saá¹gha; and one day they all began to talk about it. âMonks, have you heard how the impertinent monkey mistook a bad elephant for a good one, and climbed on his back, and how he lost his life for it?â In came the Teacher, and asked, âMonks, what are you talking of as you sit here?â and they told him. âThis is not the first time,â said he, âthat this impertinent monkey behaved so; he did the same before,â and he told them a story.

Why are you joined together with a treacherous one, light of mind, and put up with this suffering like one who fulfills all desires?

Humiliate him with your horn, and fix him in place with your foot, or more fools might grow angry, and no one will prevent him.

Heâs thinking this is me: although he does this to others, they will kill him right there, and there will be freedom for me.

When the Teacher had ended this teaching, he declared the Truths, and identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the bad buffalo was he who now is the bad elephant, the bad monkey was the same, but the virtuous noble buffalo was I myself.â

## Full Story
âAs the youth upon his way.â
 
[2.264]
 This story the Teacher told in Jetavana, about Paá¹á¸uka and Lohita. Of the Group of Six, two â Mettiya and Bhummaja â lived nearby RÄjagaha; two, Assaji and Punabbasu, near KÄ«á¹­Ägiri, and at Jetavana near SÄvatthi the two others, Paá¹á¸uka and Lohita. They questioned matters laid down in the Dhamma; whoever were their friends and intimates, they would encourage, saying: âYou are no worse than these, brother, in birth, lineage, or character; if you give up your opinions, they will have much the better of you,â and by saying this kind of thing they prevented their giving up their opinions, and thus strifes and quarrels and contentions arose.


The monks told this to the Fortunate One. The Fortunate One assembled the monks for that cause, to make explanation; and causing Paá¹á¸uka and Lohita to be summoned, addressed them, âIs it true, monks, that you really yourselves question certain matters, and prevent people from giving up their opinions?â âYes,â they replied. âThen,â said he, âyour behaviour is like that of the man and the crane,â and he told them a story.

As the young brahmin on the path thinks the jackal who ranged the woods, declaring she desired his good, was one who desired to harm him, so he thinks the woodpecker, who desired harm, one who desired good.

So does a certain person here, who is of such a kind, when a beneficial word is spoken, take it in the opposite sense. 
{2.390}

Those who do praise him, or exalt him out of fear, he thinks is a friend, as the young brahmin thinks of the woodpecker.

When the Teacher had enlarged upon this theme, he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the robber chief was I myself.â

## Full Story
âNo doubt the king.â
 This story the Teacher told in Jetavana, about one who destroyed baskets. At SÄvatthi, we learn, a certain courtier invited the Buddha and his company, and made them sit in his park. 
{2.391}
 As he was distributing to them, during the meal, he said: âLet those who wish to walk about the park, do so.â The monks walked about the park. At that time the gardener climbed up a tree which had leaves upon it, and said, taking hold of some of the large leaves, âThis will do for flowers, this one for fruit,â and making them into baskets he dropped them to the foot of the tree. His little son destroyed each as soon as it fell. The monks told this to the Teacher. âMonks,â said the Teacher, âthis is not the first time that this lad has destroyed baskets: he did it before.â And he told them a story. 
[2.267]

Certainly the king of beasts is skilled in making baskets, therefore he does spoil the basket, he surely will make another.

âNeither my mother or my father are skilled in making baskets, having made baskets we spoil them, such is our clanâs character.â 
{2.392}

âFor whoever such is natural, what would be unnatural? Donât let me see your natural or unnatural any time!â

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the monkey was the boy who has been destroying the baskets; but the wise man was I myself.â

## Full Story
âThere grows a tree.â
 This story the Teacher told in Jetavana, about the elder SÄriputta giving mango juice to the nun BimbÄdevÄ«. When the Supreme Buddha inaugurated the universal reign of the dispensation, while living in a room at VesÄli, MahÄpajÄpatÄ« GotamÄ«, along with five hundred of the SÄkiya clan, asked for initiation, and received initiation and full orders. Afterwards the five 
[2.268]
 hundred nuns became Arahats on hearing the preaching of Nandaka. But when the Teacher was living near SÄvatthi, the mother of RÄhula thought to herself, âMy husband on embracing the ascetic life has become omniscient; my son too has become an ascetic, and lives with him. What am I to do in the midst of the house? I will enter on this life, and go to SÄvatthi, and I will live looking upon the Supreme Buddha and my son continually.â So she betook herself to a nunnery, and entered the order, and went and lived in a cell at SÄvatthi, in company of her teachers and preceptors, beholding the Teacher and her beloved son. The novice RÄhula came and saw his mother.


One day, the nun was afflicted with flatulence; 
{2.393}
 and when her son came to see her, she could not get to see him, but some others came and told him she was ill. Then he went in, and asked his mother, âWhat ought you to take?â âSon,â said she, âat home this pain used to be cured by mango juice flavoured with sugar; but now we live by begging, and where can we get it?â Said the novice, âIâll get it for you,â and departed.


Now the preceptor of his reverence RÄhula was [SÄriputta], the Captain of the Dhamma, his teacher was the great MoggallÄna, his uncle was the elder Änanda, and his father was the Supreme Buddha: thus he had great luck. However, he went to no other save only to his preceptor; and after greeting him, stood before him with a sad look. âWhy do you seem sad, RÄhula?â asked the elder. âSir,â he replied, âmy mother is ill with flatulence.â âWhat must she take?â âMango juice and sugar does her good.â âAll right, Iâll get some; donât trouble about it.â


So next day he took the lad to SÄvatthi, and seating him in a waiting-room, went up to the palace. The king of Kosala bade the elder be seated. At that very moment the gardener brought a basket of sweet mangoes ripe for food. The king removed the skin, sprinkled sugar, crushed them up himself, and filled the elderâs bowl for him. The elder returned to the place of waiting and gave them to the novice, bidding him give them to his mother; and he did so. No sooner had the nun eaten, than her pain was cured. The king also sent messengers, saying: âThe elder did not sit here to eat the mango juice. Go and find out whether he gave it to any one.â The messenger went along with the elder, and found out, and then returned to tell the king. Thought the king, âIf the Teacher should return to a worldly life, he would be a Universal Monarch; the novice RÄhula would be his treasure the crown prince, 
Two of the seven 
ratanas
, or Treasures of the Empire of an universal monarch.
 the holy nun would be his treasure the empress, and all the universe would belong to them. I must go and attend upon them. Now they are living close by there is no time to be lost.â So from that day he continually gave mango syrup to the nun.


It became known among the monks how the elder gave mango syrup to the holy nun. 
{2.394}
 And one day they fell talking in the Dhamma Hall, âFriend, I hear that the elder SÄriputta comforted nun BimbÄdevÄ« with mango syrup.â The Teacher came in and asked, âWhat are you talking about now?â When they told him, âThis is not the first time, monks, that RÄhulaâs mother was comforted with mango syrup by the elder; the same happened before,â and he told them a story.

The Abbhantara mango tree, which has a fruit that is divine, eating it the pregnant woman gives birth to a Universal Monarch.

Lady, you are a great queen, also you are dear to your husband, the king will surely bring the Abbhantara mango fruit to you.

Exerting for the masterâs sake, whatever position he attains, the self-sacrificing hero, I am the one receiving it.  
[2.272]

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he identified the JÄtaka in these words, âAt that time RÄhulaâs mother was the queen, Änanda was the parrot, SÄriputta was the ascetic who gave the mango fruit, but the ascetic who lived in the park was I myself.â

## Full Story
âIt is best that you should know.â
 
[2.273]
 This tale the Teacher told at Jetavana, about a courtier of the king of Kosala. This man was very useful to the king, we are told, and did everything that had to be done. Because he was very useful, the king did him great honour. The others were jealous, and concocted a slander, and calumniated him. The king believed their saying, and without enquiring into his guilt, bound him in chains, though virtuous and innocent, and cast him into prison. There he dwelt all alone; but, by reason of his virtue, he had peace of mind, and with mind at peace he understood the conditions of existence, and attained the fruition of the First Path. By and by the king found that he was guiltless, and broke his chains and gave him honour more than before.


The man wished to pay his respects to the Teacher; and taking flowers and perfumes, he went to the monastery, and did reverence to the TathÄgata, and sat respectfully aside. The Teacher talked graciously with him. âWe have heard that ill fortune befell you,â said he. âYes, sir, but I made my ill fortune into good; and as I sat in prison, I produced the fruition of the First Path.â âGood friend,â said the Teacher, âyou are not the only one who has turned evil into good; for wise men in the olden time turned evil into good just as you did.â And he told a story of the past.

He who frequents the best has the best share, or even better, reconciling them as one, I released a hundred from slaughter.

Therefore by reconciling them with all of the world together, when dead he would go to heaven, listen to this, you of KÄsi.

The Teacher, after Fully Awakening, repeated the third verse:




3. Idaá¹ vatvÄ, mahÄrÄjÄ Kaá¹so, BÄrÄá¹asiggaho,

Dhanuá¹ kaá¹á¸aÃ±-ca nikkhippa, saá¹yamaá¹ ajjhupÄgamÄ« ti






Having said this, I, the great king Kaá¹sa, who had seized Benares, laying down my bow and quiver, entered upon moral restraint.






In this connection, 
Kaá¹sa
, this is his name.


Having seized Benares, from dwelling there he was the one 
who had seized Benares
.


The king, having spoken this word, laying down, abandoning, putting aside his 
bow
 and what is reckoned his 
quiver
 of arrows, and undertaking the practice of moral restraint, went forth, and after going forth, through producing absorption, and not losing absorption, he was reborn in the BrahmÄ Realm.




When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time Änanda was the marauding king, but the king of Benares was I myself.â

Having said this, I, the great king Kaá¹sa, who had seized Benares, laying down my bow and quiver, entered upon moral restraint.

## Full Story
âThe best, the best you always.â
 
[2.275]
 This story the Teacher told in Jetavana about the elder Dhanuggahatissa. MahÄkosala, the father of king Pasenadi, when he married his daughter, the lady KosalÄ, to king BimbisÄra, gave a village of KÄsi, producing a revenue of a hundred thousand, for bath and perfume money. When AjÄtasattu murdered the king his father, the lady Kosala died of grief. Then thought king Pasenadi, âAjÄtasattu has killed his father, my sister has died from sympathy with her husbandâs misfortune; I will not give the KÄsi town to the parricide.â So he refused to give it to AjÄtasattu. About this village there was war betwixt these two from time to time. AjÄtasattu was fierce and strong, and Pasenadi was a very old man, so he was beaten again and again, and the people of MahÄkosala were generally conquered.


Then the king asked his courtiers, âWe are constantly being beaten; what is to be done?â âMy lord,â they said, âthe venerable fathers are skilled in incantations. We must hear the word of the monks who dwell in Jetavana.â Then the king dispatched couriers, bidding them listen to the converse of the monks at a suitable time.


Now at the time there were two old elders living in a leaf-hut close to the monastery, whose names were elder Utta and elder Dhanuggahatissa. 
{2.404}
 Dhanuggahatissa had slept through the first and second watch of the night; and awaking in the last watch, he broke some sticks, lit a fire, and sitting down said: âUtta, my friend!â âWhat is it, friend Tissa?â âAre you not asleep?â âNow we are awake, whatâs to do?â âGet up, now, and sit by me.â So he did, and began to talk to him. âThat stupid, pot-bellied Kosala never has a jar full of boiled rice without letting it spoil; how to plan a war he knows not a bit. He is always being beaten and forced to pay.â âBut what should he do?â Now just then the couriers stood listening to their talk.


The elder Dhanuggahatissa discussed the nature of war. âWar, sir,â said he, âconsists of three kinds: the lotus army, the wheel army, and the wagon army. 
These are technical terms in Sanskrit also (
padmavyÅ«ho
, 
Åakaá¹­a
Â°, 
cakra
Â°); see Manu 7. 188, 7. 187, and B. R. dict. 
s.v.
 The âwheelâ explains itself: the âwagonâ was a wedge-shaped phalanx; the âlotus,â as noted by BÃ¼hler (translation of Manu in 
Sacred Books of the East
 page 246), is âequally extended on all sides and perfectly circular, the centre being occupied by the king.â
 If those who wish to capture AjÄtasattu will post garrisons in two hill-forts right away in the hills, and pretend that they are weak, and watch till they get him among the hills, and bar his passage, leap out from the two forts and take him in front and in the rear, and shout aloud, they will quickly have him like a landed fish, like a frog in the fist; and so they will be able to secure him.â All this the couriers told their king. The king caused the drum to be beaten for the attack, arranged his army wagon-wise, took AjÄtasattu alive; his daughter, princess VajirÄ he gave in marriage to his sisterâs son, and dismissed her with the KÄsi village for her bath-money.


This event became known among the Saá¹gha. One day, they were all talking about it in the Dhamma Hall, âFriend, I hear that the king of Kosala conquered AjÄtasattu through the instructions of Dhanuggahatissa.â The Teacher 
[2.276]
 came in, âWhat do you sit here talking about now, monks?â asked he. They told him. He said: âThis is not the first time that Dhanuggahatissa was clever in discussing war,â and he told them a story. 
{2.405}

You wandered before destroying the best, having overcome the boar in this place, now alone, having departed, you brood, tiger, why is your strength not found today?â

Before these surely go from place to place, afraid, troubled, they sought out their own caves, now, having gathered, they dwell together, standing they are hard for me to conquer.

Honour to the group gathered together, having seen a wondrous friendship, I say, where the tusker-beasts conquered the tiger, freed through concord amongst those strong in tooth.

After this discourse the Teacher identified the JÄtaka, âDhanuggaha the elder was the Carpenterâs Boar, and I was the Tree DevatÄ.â

âWhatever riches they who strive.â
 This story the Teacher told about a brahmin who stole good luck. 
{2.410}
 The circumstances of this birth-tale are given above in the Khadiraá¹gajÄtaka [Ja 40].

For AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika, who had lavished fifty-four crores on the dispensation of the Buddha over the monastery alone, and who valued naught else save only the Three Jewels, used to go every day while the Teacher was at Jetavana to attend the Great Services â once at daybreak, once after breakfast, and once in the evening. There were intermediate services too; but he never went empty-handed, for fear the novices and lads should look to see what he had brought with him. When he went in the early morning, he used to have rice-gruel taken up; after breakfast, ghee, butter, honey, molasses, and the like; and in the evening, he brought perfumes, garlands and cloths. So much did he expend day after day, that his expense knew no bounds. Moreover, many traders borrowed money from him on their bonds â to the amount of eighteen crores; and the great merchant never called the money in. Furthermore, another eighteen crores of the family property, which were buried in the riverbank, were washed out to sea, when the bank was swept away by a storm; and down rolled the brazen pots, with fastenings and seals unbroken, to the bottom of the ocean. In his house, too, there was always rice standing ready for 500 monks â so that the merchantâs house was to the Saá¹gha like a pool dug where four roads meet, yes, like mother and father was he to them. Therefore, even the Supreme Buddha used to go to his house, and the Eighty Chief Elders too; and the number of other monks passing in and out was beyond measure.


Now his house was seven stories high and had seven portals; and over the fourth gateway dwelt a DevatÄ who was a heretic. When the Supreme Buddha came into the house, she could not stay in her abode on high, but came down with her children to the ground-floor; and she had to do the same whenever the Eighty Chief Elders or the other elders came in and out. Thought she, âSo long as the ascetic Gotama and his disciples keep coming into this house I can have no peace here; I canât be eternally coming downstairs to the ground floor. I must contrive to stop them from coming any more to this house.â So one day, when the business manager had retired to rest, she appeared before him in visible shape.


âWho is that?â said he. âIt is I,â was the reply, âthe DevatÄ who lives over the fourth gateway.â âWhat brings you here?â âYou donât see what the merchant is doing. Heedless of his own future, he is drawing upon his resources, only to enrich the ascetic Gotama. He engages in no commerce; he undertakes no business. Advise the merchant to attend to his business, and arrange that the ascetic Gotama with his disciples shall come no more into the house.â


Then said he, âFoolish DevatÄ, if the merchant does spend his money, he spends it on the dispensation of the Buddha, which leads to safety. Even if he were to seize me by the hair and sell me for a slave, I will say nothing. Begone!â


Another day, she went to the merchantâs eldest son and gave him the same advice. And he flouted her in just the same manner. But to the merchant himself she did not so much as dare to speak on the matter.


Now by dint of unending munificence and of doing no business, the merchantâs incomings diminished and his estate grew less and less; so that he sank by degrees into poverty, and his table, his dress, and his bed and food were no longer what they had once been. Yet, in spite of his altered circumstances, be continued to entertain the Saá¹gha, though he was no longer able to feast them. So one day when he had made his bow and taken his seat, the Teacher said to him, âHouseholder, are gifts being given at your house?â âYes, sir,â said he, âbut thereâs only a little sour husk-porridge, left over from yesterday.â âBe not distressed, householder, at the thought that you can only offer what is unpalatable. If the heart be good, the food given to Buddhas, Paccekabuddhas, and their disciples, cannot but be good too. And why? Because of the greatness of the fruit thereof. For he who can make his heart acceptable cannot give an unacceptable gift â as is to be testified by the following passage:

For, if the heart have faith, no gift is small

To Buddhas or to their disciples true.


âTis said no service can be reckoned small

Thatâs paid to Buddhas, lords of great renown.


Mark well what fruit rewarded that poor gift

Of pottage â dried-up, sour, and lacking salt.â 
The first two lines are from the 
VimÄnavatthu
, page 44.

Also, he said this further thing, âHouseholder, in giving this unpalatable gift, you are giving it to those who have entered on the Noble Eightfold Path. Whereas I, when in VelÄmaâs time I stirred up all JambudÄ«pa by giving the seven things of price, and in my largesse poured them forth as though I had made into one mighty stream the five great rivers â I yet found none who had reached the Three Refuges or kept the Five Precepts; for rare are those who are worthy of offerings. Therefore, let not your heart be troubled by the thought that your gift is unpalatable.â And so saying, he repeated the VelÄmakasutta [AN 9.20].


Now that DevatÄ who had not dared to speak to the merchant in the days of his magnificence, thought that now he was poor he would hearken to her, and so, entering his chamber at dead of night she appeared before him in visible shape, standing in mid-air. âWhoâs that?â said the merchant, when he became aware of her presence. âI am the DevatÄ, great merchant, who dwells over the fourth gateway.â âWhat brings you here?â âTo give you counsel.â âProceed, then.â âGreat merchant, you take no thought for your own future or for your own children. You have expended vast sums on the dispensation of the ascetic Gotama; in fact, by long-continued expenditure and by not undertaking new business you have been brought by the ascetic Gotama to poverty. But even in your poverty you do not shake off the ascetic Gotama! The ascetics are in and out of your house this very day just the same! What they have had of you cannot be recovered. That may be taken for certain. But henceforth donât you go yourself to the ascetic Gotama and donât let his disciples set foot inside your house. Do not even turn to look at the ascetic Gotama but attend to your trade and traffic in order to restore the family estate.â


Then he said to her, âWas this the counsel you wanted to give me?â âYes, it was.â


Said the merchant, âThe One with Ten Powers has made me proof against a hundred, a thousand, yes against a hundred thousand DevatÄs such as you are! My faith is strong and steadfast as Mount Sineru! My substance has been expended on the dispensation that leads to safety. Wicked are your words; it is a blow aimed at the dispensation of the Buddhas by you, you wicked and impudent wretch. I cannot live under the same roof with you; be off at once from my house and seek shelter elsewhere!â


Hearing these words of that converted man and elect disciple, she could not stay, but repairing to her dwelling, took her children by the hand and went forth. But though she went, she was minded, if she could not find herself a lodging elsewhere, to appease the merchant and return to dwell in his house; and in this mind she went to the tutelary deity of the city and with due salutation stood before him. Being asked what had brought her there, she said: âMy lord, I have been speaking imprudently to AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika, and he in his anger has turned me out of my home. Take me to him and make it up between us, so that he may let me live there again.â âBut what was it you said to the merchant?â âI told him for the future not to support the Buddha and the Saá¹gha, and not to let the ascetic Gotama set foot again in his house. This is what I said, my lord.â âWicked were your words; it was a blow aimed at the dispensation. I cannot take you with me to the merchant.â Meeting with no support from him, she went to the Four Great Kings of the world. And being repulsed by them in the same manner, she went on to Sakka, King of Devas, and told him her story, beseeching him still more earnestly, as follows, âDeva, finding no shelter, I wander about homeless, leading my children by the hand. Grant me of your majesty some place wherein to dwell.â


And he too said to her, âYou have done wickedly; it was a blow aimed at the Conquerorâs dispensation. I cannot speak to the merchant on your behalf. But I can tell you one way whereby the merchant may be led to pardon you.â âPray tell me, Deva.â âMen have had eighteen crores of the merchant on bonds. Take the semblance of his agent, and without telling anybody repair to their houses with the bonds, in the company of some young Yakkhas. Stand in the middle of their houses with the bond in one hand and a receipt in the other, and terrify them with your Yakkha power, saying, âHereâs your acknowledgment of the debt. Our merchant did not move in the matter while he was affluent; but now he is poor, and you must pay up the money you owe.â By your Yakkha power obtain all those eighteen crores of gold and fill the merchantâs empty treasuries. He had another treasure buried in the banks of the river AciravatÄ«, but when the bank was washed away, the treasure was swept into the sea. Get that back also by your supernatural power and store it in his treasuries. Further, there is another sum of eighteen crores lying unowned in such and such a place. Bring that too and pour the money into his empty treasuries. When you have atoned by the recovery of these fifty-four crores, ask the merchant to forgive you.â âVery good, Deva,â said she. And she set to work obediently, and did just as she had been bidden. When she had recovered all the money, she went into the merchantâs chamber at dead of night and appeared before him in visible shape standing in the air.


The merchant asking who was there, she replied, âIt is I, great merchant, the blind and foolish DevatÄ who lived over your fourth gateway. In the greatness of my infatuate folly I knew not the virtues of a Buddha, and so came to say what I said to you some days ago. Pardon me my fault! At the instance of Sakka, King of Devas, I have made atonement by recovering the eighteen crores owing to you, the eighteen crores which had been washed down into the sea, and another eighteen crores which were lying unowned in such and such a place â making fifty-four crores in all, which I have poured into your empty treasure-chambers. The sum you expended on the monastery at Jetavana is now made up again. While I have nowhere to dwell, I am in misery. Bear not in mind what I did in my ignorant folly, great merchant, but pardon me.â

As before, the heretical spirit that lived in the gate tower of AnÄthapiá¹á¸ikaâs house, doing penance, brought four and fifty crores of gold and filled the store-rooms, and became a friend of the great man. He led her before the Teacher. The Teacher discoursed to her. She heard, and entered on the First Path. Thenceforward the great manâs honour was great as before.


Now there was living in SÄvatthi a brahmin, versed in lucky marks, who thought on this wise. âAnÄthapiá¹á¸ika was poor, and then became famous. What if I make as though I went to see him, and steal his luck?â So to the house he went, and was welcomed hospitably. After exchanging civilities, the host asked why he had come. The brahmin was looking about to see where the manâs luck lay. Now AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika had a white chicken, white as a scoured shell, which he kept in a golden cage, and in the comb of this chicken lay the great manâs luck. The brahmin looked about and spied where the luck lay. âNoble sir,â said he, âI teach magic charms to five hundred young fellows. We are plagued by a chicken that crows at the wrong time. Your chicken crows at the right time. For him I have come; will you give him to me?â âYes,â said the other: and at the instant the word was uttered, the hick left the cockscomb, and settled in a jewel put away in the pillow. The brahmin observed that the luck had gone into this jewel, and asked for it too. As soon as the owner agreed to give it, the luck left the jewel, and settled in a club for self-defence which lay upon the pillow. The brahmin saw it and asked again. âTake it, and take your leave,â said the owner; and in an instant the luck left the club, and settled on the head of the ownerâs chief wife, who was named the lady PuÃ±Ã±alakkhaá¹Ä. The thievish brahmin thought, when he saw this, âThis is an inalienable article which I cannot ask for.â


Then he told the great man, âNoble sir,â said he, âI came to your house to steal your luck. The luck was in the comb of your 
[2.280]
 chicken. But when you gave me the chicken, the luck passed into this jewel; when you gave me the jewel it passed into your stick; when you gave the stick to me, it went out of it 
{2.411}
 and passed into the head of the lady PuÃ±Ã±alakkhaá¹Ä. Surely this is inalienable, I can never get it. It is impossible to steal your luck â keep it, then!â and rising from his seat, he departed.


AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika determined to tell the TathÄgata; so he came to the monastery, and after respectfully greeting him, sat on one side, and told the Buddha all about it. The Teacher listened, and said: âHouseholder, now-a-days the luck of one man does not go to another. But formerly the luck belonging to those of small wit went to the wise,â and he told him a story of the past.

Whoever zealously gathers a lot of wealth, without fortune, those with skill, those without skill, having good luck, can enjoy that wealth.

Everywhere to the one who made merit, overcoming beings, a lot of wealth will arise, even without making exertion. 
{2.414}

A chicken, jewels, a staff, and women are all signs of merit, they arise for the person, without wickedness, who made merit.

Then he identified the JÄtaka, âElder Änanda was the king, and the family priest was the Supreme Buddha.â

In the present the outside sects are struggling and try to sully the reputation of the Buddha and the Saá¹gha by staging a murder and blaming it on them, before being found out, and reduced to even lower standing. The Buddha tells a story of boars who tried to sully a jewel, only to make it shine forth stronger.

âTo hell shall go he.â
 
[2.283]
 This story the Teacher told at Jetavana, about the murder of SundarÄ«. At that time we learn that the Bodhisatta was honoured and respected. The circumstances were the same as in the Kandhaka; 
This story is given in 
UdÄna
, iv. 8 (p. 43). 
Khandhaka
 seems to mean the 
Vinaya
 (Childers 
s. v.

s. v.
), but I cannot find the story there. [The text actually reads: 
Kandhake
, which may be a misprint for 
Khandhake
, but either way this does seem to be a mistake, as the story is not told in the 
Vinaya
. The Burmese edition reads: 
...vatthu UdÄne Ägatam-eva
, which is correct.]
 this is an abstract of them. The Saá¹gha of the Fortunate One had received gain and honour like five rivers pouring in a mighty flood; the heretics, finding that gain and honour came to them no longer, becoming dim like fireflies at sunrise, they collected together, and took counsel, âEver since the ascetic Gotama appeared, our gain and glory has gone from us. Not a soul ever knows that we exist. Who will help us to bring reproach on Gotama, and prevent him from getting all this?â


Then an idea occurred to them. âSundarÄ« will make us able to do it.â So when one day SundarÄ« visited the hereticsâ grove, they gave her greeting, but said nothing more. She addressed them again and again, but received no answer. âHas anything annoyed the holy fathers?â she asked. âWhy, sister,â they said, âdo not you see how the ascetic Gotama annoys us, depriving us of alms and honour?â âWhat can I do about it?â she said. âYou, sister, are fair and lovely. You can bring disgrace upon Gotama, and your words will influence a great many, 
{2.416}
 and you can thus restore our gains and good repute.â She agreed, and took her leave.


After this she used to take flowers and scents and perfumes, camphor, condiments and fruits, and at evening time, when a great crowd had entered the city after hearing the Teacherâs discourse, she would set her face towards Jetavana. If any asked where she was going, she would say, âTo the ascetic Gotama; I live with him in one perfumed chamber.â Then she spent the night in a heretical settlement, and in the morning entered the road which led from Jetavana into the city. If any asked her where she was going, she replied, âI have been with the ascetic Gotama in one perfumed chamber, and he made love to me.â


After the lapse of some days they hired some ruffians to kill SundarÄ« before Gotamaâs chamber and throw her body into the dust-heap. And so they did. Then the heretics made a hue and cry after SundarÄ«, and informed the king. He asked where their suspicions pointed. They answered that she had gone the last few days to Jetavana, but what happened afterwards they did not know. He sent them to search for her. Acting on this permission, they took his own servants, and went to Jetavana, where they hunted about till they found her in the dust-heap. Calling for a litter, they brought the body into the town, and told the king that the disciples of Gotama had killed SundarÄ«, and thrown her in the dust-heap, in order to cloak the wrong of their teacher.


The king bade them scour the city. All through the streets they went, crying, âCome and see what has been done by the monastics of the Sakya prince!â and came back to the palace door. The king had placed the body of SundarÄ« upon a platform, and had it watched in the cemetery. All the populace, except the holy disciples, went about inside the town, outside the town, in the parks and in the woods, abusing the monks, and crying out, âCome and see what the monastics of the Sakya prince have done!â The monks told all this to the TathÄgata. Said the Teacher, âWell, go and reprove these people in these words: 
[2.284]

âTo hell shall go he that delights in lies,

And he who having done a thing, denies: 
{2.417}

Both these, when death has carried them away,

As men of evil deeds elsewhere shall rise.â 
Dhp v. 306; 
SuttanipÄta
, v. 661.

The king directed some men to find out whether SundarÄ« had been killed by anybody else. Now the ruffians had drunk the blood-money, and were quarrelling together. Said one to another, âYou killed SundarÄ« with one blow, and then threw her in the dust-heap, and here you are, buying liquor with the blood-money!â âAll right, all right,â said the kingâs messengers; and they caught the ruffians and dragged them before the king. âDid you kill her?â asked the king. They said: âYes, they did.â âWho bade you?â âThe heretics, my lord.â The king had the heretics summoned. âLift up SundarÄ«,â said he, âand carry her round the city, crying as you go: âThis woman SundarÄ« wanted to bring disgrace upon the ascetic Gotama; we had her murdered; the guilt is not Gotamaâs, nor his disciples;â the guilt is ours!â â They did so.


A multitude of the unconverted believed, and the heretics were kept out of mischief by receiving the punishment for murder. Thenceforward the Buddhaâs reputation grew greater and greater.


And then one day they began to gossip in the Dhamma Hall, âFriend, the heretics thought to blacken the Buddha, and they only blackened themselves: ever since, our gains and glory have increased!â The Teacher came in, and asked what they were talking about? They told him. âMonks,â said he, âit is impossible to make the Buddha impure. Trying to stain the Buddha, is like trying to stain a gem of the greatest brilliance. In bygone ages people have wished to stain a fine jewel, and no matter how they tried, they failed to do it.â And he told them a story.

Inside the cave for seven years at least thirty of us do dwell, we will destroy the crystal light, thus for us there was a wise one. 
[2.285]

In whatever way we rub the crystal it becomes more clear, now we ask you about this: what do you think ought to be done here?

This precious crystal, that is flawless, unblemished and brilliant, nothing is able to destroy its light, O boars, you must depart.

After this discourse was ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time, I was the ascetic.â

{2.419}
 This story the Teacher told in Jetavana, about the temptation springing from a sensual girl. The circumstances will be explained in the CullanÄradakassapa [Ja 477] story.

This story the Teacher told, while dwelling at Jetavana, about the allurements of a sensual girl.


There was then, we learn, a girl of about sixteen, daughter of a citizen of SÄvatthi, such as might bring good luck to a man, yet no man chose her. So her mother thought to herself, âThis my daughter is of full age, yet no one chooses her. I will use her as bait for a fish, and make one of those SÄkiyan ascetics come back to the world, and live upon him.â At the time there was a young man of good birth living in SÄvatthi, who had given his heart to the dispensation and went forth. But from the time when he had received full ordination he had lost all desire for learning, and lived devoted to the adornment of his person.


The lay sister used to prepare in her house rice gruel, and other food hard or soft, and standing at the door, as the monks walked along the streets, looked out for someone who could be tempted by the craving for delicacies. Streaming by went a crowd of monks who upheld the Three Baskets, including the Abhidhamma and the Vinaya; but among them she saw none ready to rise to her bait. Among the figures with bowl and robe, preachers of the Dhamma with honey-sweet voice, moving like fleecy scud before the wind, she saw not one.


But at last she perceived a man approaching, the outer corners of his eyes anointed, hair hanging down, wearing an under-robe of fine cloth, and an outer robe shaken and cleansed, bearing a bowl coloured like some precious gem, and a sunshade after his own heart, a man who let his senses have their own way, his body much bronzed. âHere is a man I can catch!â thought she; and greeting him, she took his bowl, and invited him into the house. She found him a seat, and provided rice gruel and all the rest; then after the meal, begged him to make that house his resort in future. So he used to visit the house after that, and in course of time became intimate.


One day, the lay sister said in his hearing, âIn this household we are happy enough, only I have no son or son-in-law capable of keeping it up.â The man heard it, and wondering what reason she could have for so saying, in a little while he was as it were pierced to the heart. She said to her daughter, âTempt this man, and get him into your power.â So the girl after that time decked herself and adorned herself, and tempted him with all womenâs tricks and wiles. Then the man, being young and under the power of passion, thought in his heart, âI cannot now hold on to the Buddhaâs dispensation,â and he went to the monastery, and laying down bowl and robe, said to his spiritual teachers, âI am discontented.â


Then they conducted him to the Teacher, and said: âSir, this monk is discontented.â

So the Teacher asked this monk whether it was true he had fallen in love. Yes, he said. âWith whom?â the Teacher asked. âWith a sensual girl.â âThat woman, monk,â said the Teacher, âis your bane; long ago, as now, you became food for the crowd through your desire to marry her.â Then at the request of the monks he told a story of the past.

Do not envy SÄlÅ«ka, he eats food ending in misery, being unconcerned eat your chaff, that is the mark of a long life.

Now, after coming here, strangers together with their attendant will see SÄlÅ«ka lying down and with his grinder facing up.

Seeing the pig lying all cut up with his grinder facing up, the old bulls did think: âOur chaff is comparatively excellent.â

When the Teacher had finished this discourse, he declared the Truths, and identified the JÄtaka, at the conclusion of the Truths, the monk in question attained the fruition of the First Path. âAt that time, the sensual girl was the same, the lovesick monk was SÄlÅ«ka, Änanda was Cullalohita, and I was MahÄlohita myself.â

[2.287]
 This story the Teacher told at Jetavana, about a fellow monastic of the elder SÄriputta. 
{2.421}
 This monk came and greeted the elder, and sitting on one side, he asked him to tell the way in which one could get gains, and how he could get robes and the like. The elder replied, âFriend, there are four qualities which make a man successful in getting gains. He must get rid of modesty from his heart, must resign his orders, must seem to be mad even if he is not; he must speak slander; he must behave like a dancer; he must use unkind words everywhere.â Thus he explained how a man gets great gains. The monk objected to this method, and went away. The elder went to his Teacher, and told him about it. The Teacher said: âThis is not the first time that this monk spoke in dispraise of gains; he did the same before,â and then, at the request of the elder, he told a story of the past.

He who is mad, slanderous, an actor, who creates a commotion, gains are received amongst the fools, this is my instruction to you. 
{2.422}

Cursed be those gains of fame and those gains of wealth, O brahmin, whatever livelihood is gained through destruction or wrong living.

If taking up a bowl and without a home I would wander forth, that life is surely better than seeking out whatever is wrong. 
{2.423}

When the Teacher had ended this discourse he thus identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the monk who disapproved of gain was the young man, but his teacher was I myself.â

[Although not as clear as we might like, this seems to refer to Ja 98 
KÅ«á¹­avÄá¹ijajÄtaka
, the story from which I include here.]

This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a cheating merchant. There were two merchants in partnership at SÄvatthi, we are told, who travelled with their merchandise and came back with the proceeds. And the cheating merchant thought to himself, âMy partner has been badly fed and badly lodged for so many days past that he will die of indigestion now he has got home again and can feast to his heartâs content on dainties manifold. My plan is to divide what we have made into three portions, giving one to his orphans and keeping two for myself.â And with this object he made some excuse day by day for putting off the division of the profits.


Finding that it was in vain to press for a division, the honest partner went to the Teacher at the monastery, made his salutation, and was received kindly. âIt is a very long time,â said the Buddha, âsince you came last to see me.â And hereupon the merchant told the Teacher what had befallen him.


âThis is not the first time, lay-follower,â said the Teacher, âthat this man has been a cheating merchant; he was no less a cheat in times past. As he tries to defraud you now, so did he try to defraud the wise and good of other days.â So saying, at the merchantâs request, the Teacher told this story of the past.

Fish valued in excess of a thousand, there is no person who would believe it! To me they were just seven farthings here, I could even buy a whole string of fish.

Having given food to the fish, to me you gave an offering, through remembering this offering, that respect was paid by you. 
{2.426}

There is no growth for one corrupt at heart, also DevatÄs do not respect him, he who cheats his brother of paternal property is one who performs wrong deeds. 
[2.290]

After this discourse, the Teacher declared the Truths: at the conclusion of which the merchant entered upon the fruition of the First Path, and identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the younger brother was the dishonest merchant, but the elder was I myself.â

âWe live in one house.â
 This story the Teacher told in Jetavana, about the venerable Änandaâs asking for eight boons. 
[Mistranslated in the original as â...taking a valuable article.â]
 The circumstances will be explained in the Juá¹hajÄtaka [Ja 456], in the Eleventh Book. 
{2.427}

This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana about the boons received by elder Änanda. During the twenty years of his first Buddhahood the Fortunate Oneâs attendants were not always the same: sometimes elder NÄgasamÄla, sometimes NÄgita, UpavÄá¹a, Sunakkhatta, Cunda, SÄgala, sometimes Meghiya waited upon the Fortunate One. One day the Fortunate One said to the monks, âNow I am old, monks: and when I say, âLet us go in this way,â some of the Saá¹gha go by another way, some drop my bowl and robe on the ground. Choose out one monk to attend always upon me.â


Then they all rose up, beginning with elder SÄriputta, and laid their joined hands to their heads, crying, âI will serve you, sir, I will serve you!â But he refused them, saying: âYour prayer is forestalled! Enough.â Then the monks said to the elder Änanda, âDo you, friend, ask for the post of attendant.â The elder said: âIf the Fortunate One will not give me the robe which he himself has received, if he will not give me his dole of food, if he will not grant me to dwell in the same fragrant cell, if he will not have me with him to go where he is invited; but if the Fortunate One will go with me where I am invited, if I shall be granted to introduce the company at the moment of coming, which comes from foreign parts and foreign countries to see the Fortunate One, if I shall be granted to approach the Fortunate One as soon as doubt shall arise, if whenever the Fortunate One shall discourse in my absence he will repeat his discourse to me as soon as I shall return: then I will attend upon the Fortunate One.â These eight boons he craved, four negative and four positive. And the Fortunate One granted them to him.


After that he attended continually upon his Teacher for five and twenty years. So having obtained the preeminence in the five points, and having gained seven blessings â blessing of Dhamma, blessing of instruction, blessing of the knowledge of causes, blessing of inquiry as to oneâs good, blessing of dwelling in a holy place, blessing of enlightened devotion, blessing of potential Buddhahood â in the presence of the Buddha he received the heritage of eight boons, and became famous in the Buddhaâs dispensation, and shone as the moon in the heavens.


One day they began to talk about it in the Dhamma Hall, âFriend, the TathÄgata has satisfied elder Änanda by granting his boons.â The Teacher entered, and asked, âWhat are you speaking of, monks, as you sit here?â They told him. Then he said: âIt is not now the first time, monks, but in former days as now I satisfied Änanda with a boon; in former days, as now, whatsoever he asked, I gave him.â And so saying, he told a story of the past.

Having various desires, great king, we must live in but one house, I would wish for royal village, brahmini for a hundred cows,

My son for a horse and carriage, daughter for a jewelled earring, while the wretched girl Puá¹á¹ikÄ expects a mortar and pestle.

To brahmin a royal village, to brahmini a hundred cows, to your son a horse and carriage, to daughter a jewelled earring, and to this wretched girl Puá¹á¹ikÄ give a mortar and pestle.

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the brahmin was Änanda, but the king was I myself.â

In the present a brahmin seeks to find out if the king favours him for his birth, or for his goodness, so he starts stealing a penny a day from the king. When the king finds out he decides to punish him, until the brahmin explains his actions. The Buddha tells a story of similar happenings in a past life.

## Full Story
âVirtue is lovely.â
 This story the Teacher told at Jetavana, about a brahmin who put his reputation to the test. The circumstances which gave rise to it, and the story itself, are both given in the SÄ«lavÄ«maá¹sajÄtaka [Ja 86], in the First Book.

This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a brahmin who put to the test his reputation for virtue. This brahmin, who was maintained by the king of Kosala, had sought the Three Refuges; he kept the Five Precepts, and was versed in the Three Vedas. âThis is a virtuous man,â thought the king, and showed him great honour. But that brahmin thought to himself, âThe king shows honour to me beyond other brahmins, and has manifested his great regard by making me his spiritual director. But is his favour due to my virtue or only to my birth, lineage, family, country and accomplishments? I must clear this up without delay.â


Accordingly, one day when he was leaving the palace, he took without permission a coin from a treasurerâs counter, and went his way. Such was the treasurerâs veneration for the brahmin that he sat perfectly still and said not a word. Next day the brahmin took two coins; but still the official made no remonstrance. The third day the brahmin took a whole handful of coins. âThis is the third day,â cried the treasurer, âthat you have robbed his majesty,â and he shouted out three times, âI have caught the thief who robs the treasury.â In rushed a crowd of people from every side, crying, âAh, youâve long been posing as a model of virtue.â And dealing him two or three blows, they led him before the king. In great sorrow the king said to him, âWhat led you, brahmin, to do so wicked a thing?â And he gave orders, saying: âOff with him to punishment.â âI am no thief, sire,â said the brahmin. âThen why did you take money from the treasury?â âBecause you showed me such great honour, sire, and because I made up my mind to find out whether that honour was paid to my birth and the like or only to my virtue. That was my motive, and now I know for certain (inasmuch as you order me off to punishment) that it was my virtue and not my birth and other advantages, that won me your majestyâs favour.


Virtue I know to be the chief and supreme good; I know too that to virtue I can never attain in this life, while I remain a layman, living in the midst of sensual pleasures. Wherefore, this very day I would willingly go to the Teacher at Jetavana and renounce the world for the Saá¹gha. Grant me your leave, sire.â The king consenting, the brahmin set out for Jetavana. His friends and relations in a body tried to turn him from his purpose, but, finding their efforts of no avail, left him alone.


He came to the Teacher and asked to be admitted to the Saá¹gha. After admission to the lower and higher ordination, he won by application insight and became an Arahat, whereon he drew near to the Teacher, saying: âSir, my joining the Saá¹gha has borne the Supreme Fruit,â thereby signifying that he had became an Arahat.


Hearing of this, the monks, assembling in the Dhamma Hall, spoke with one another of the virtues of the kingâs family priest who tested his own reputation for virtue and who, leaving the king, had now risen to be an Arahat. Entering the Hall, the Teacher asked what the monks were discussing, and they told him. âNot without a precedent, monks,â said he, âis the action of this brahmin in putting to the test his reputation for virtue and in working out his safety after renouncing the world. The like was done by the wise and good of bygone days as well.â And so saying, he told this story of the past.

Virtue, it seems, is lovely, virtue in the world is unsurpassed, look at the poisonous snake, being virtuous he is not hurt. 
{2.430}

I will undertake that blessÃ¨d virtue approved of in the world, through being noble in behaviour one is called virtuous.

Being dear to his relatives, he shines brightly amongst his friends, the virtuous at bodyâs break up arises in a good state.

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the brahmin family priest who tried his reputation for virtue was I myself.â

 This story the Teacher told at Jetavana, about a nephew of AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika. This person had squandered an inheritance of forty crores of gold. Then he visited his uncle, who gave him a thousand, and bade him trade with it. The man squandered this, and then came again; and 
[2.294]
 once more he was given five hundred. Having squandered this like the rest, next time his uncle gave him two coarse garments; and when he had worn these out, and once more applied, his uncle had him taken by the neck and turned out of doors. The fellow was helpless, and fell down by a side-wall and died. They dragged him outside and threw him down there. AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika went and told the TathÄgata what had happened to his nephew. Said the Teacher, âHow could you expect to satisfy the man whom I long ago failed to satisfy, even when I gave him the Wishing Cup?â At his request, he proceeded to tell him a story of the past.

A villain received a water jar that gave all that was desired, as long as he protected it, that far his happiness flourished.

When, intoxicated and wanton, from heedlessness he broke the jar, then, being naked and poor, the fool afterwards suffered hardship. 
[2.295]

So he who, having received wealth, being heedless makes use of it, later that stupid one suffers, like the villain who broke the pot.

Then he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time AnÄthapiá¹á¸ikaâs nephew was the rascal who broke the Lucky Cup, but I myself was Sakka.â

âHere, in Benares city.â
 
{2.433}
 This story the Teacher told in Jetavana, about a meal of rice mixed with new ghee, with red fish to flavour it, which was given by elder SÄriputta to BimbÄdevÄ«. The circumstances are like those given above in the AbbhantarajÄtaka [Ja 281].

When the Supreme Buddha inaugurated the universal reign of the dispensation, while living in a room at VesÄli, MahÄpajÄpatÄ« GotamÄ«, along with five hundred of the SÄkiya clan, asked for initiation, and received initiation and full orders. Afterwards the five hundred nuns became Arahats on hearing the preaching of Nandaka. But when the Teacher was living near SÄvatthi, the mother of RÄhula thought to herself, âMy husband on embracing the ascetic life has become omniscient; my son too has become an ascetic, and lives with him. What am I to do in the midst of the house? I will enter on this life, and go to SÄvatthi, and I will live looking upon the Supreme Buddha and my son continually.â So she betook herself to a nunnery, and entered the order, and went and lived in a cell at SÄvatthi, in company of her teachers and preceptors, beholding the Teacher and her beloved son. The novice RÄhula came and saw his mother.

Here too the holy nun had a pain in the stomach. The excellent RÄhula told the elder. He seated RÄhula in his waiting-room, and went to the king to get the rice, red fish and new ghee. The lad gave it to the holy nun, his mother. No sooner had she eaten than the pain subsided. The king sent messengers to make enquiries, and after that always sent her that kind of food.


One day they began to talk about it in the Dhamma Hall, âFriend, the Captain of the Dhamma satisfied the nun with such and such food.â The Teacher came in, and asked what they were talking about: they told him. Said he, âThis is not the first time, monk, that SÄriputta has given RÄhulaâs mother what she wanted; he did the same before.â So saying, he told a story of the past.

In Benares, great king, a king of the crows dwells, named Supatta, surrounded by eighty thousand.

His pregnant wife SuphassÄ wished to feast upon the kingâs own costly food cooked in the kingâs kitchen.

Amongst these Iâm the messenger who was sent, come here to the king, I pay respects to my master, I made a wound upon his nose. 
{2.436}

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the king was Änanda, the captain was SÄriputta, but Supatta was I myself.â

 son wondered who could be found to cure him. The man thought: âIf I can only get rid of this disease, I will take to the ascetic life.â Now it happened that some days after he took something that did him good, and got well. Then he went to Jetavana, and asked admission into the Saá¹gha. He received the lower and higher ordination from the Teacher, and before long became an Arahat. One day after this the monks were talking together in the Dhamma Hall, âFriend, So and so had jaundice, and vowed that if he got well he would embrace the ascetic life; he did so, and now he has became an Arahat.â The Teacher came in, and asked what they talked about, sitting there together. 
{2.437}
 They told him. Then he said: âMonks, this is not the only man who has done so. Long ago wise men, recovering from sickness, embraced an ascetic life, and secured their own advantage.â And he told a story of the past.

For me who was touched by a certain illness, oppressed with suffering by a strong disease, this corpse of a body quickly shrivels up, like a flower thatâs made to dry in the dust.

The lovely reckoned unlovely, the impure is thought to be pure, not seeing this lovely form is full of many disgusting things.

Cursed be this unhealthy, putrid body, revolting, impure, whose nature is illness, when people are heedless, infatuated, they neglect the path to rebirth in a good state.

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he proclaimed the Truths, and identified the JÄtaka â many were they who attained the fruition of the First Path, and so forth. âAt that time I myself was the ascetic.â

On the other hand, Devadatta praised KokÄlika, in such words as these, âKokÄlika comes from a northern brahmin family; he follows the ascetic life; he is learned in Dhamma, a preacher of the Dhamma. Give to KokÄlika, help him!â So they went about, praising each other, and getting fed in different houses.


One day the monks began to talk about it in the Dhamma Hall. âFriend, Devadatta and KokÄlika go about praising each other for virtues which they havenât got, and so getting food.â The Teacher came in, and asked what they were talking about as they sat there.

A son of good family knows how to praise a good family, my friend, similar to a young tiger, I give to you, please eat.

I see after a long time those who speak falsely come together, accepting vomit and corpses, and those who praise one another.

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he summed up the JÄtaka, âAt that time the jackal was Devadatta, the crow was KokÄlika, but the spirit of the Tree was I myself.â

âOver the salt sea wave.â
 This story the Teacher told at Jetavana, about elder Upananda. This man was a great eater and drinker; there was no satisfying him even with cartloads of provisions. During the rainy season he would pass his time at two or three different settlements, leaving his shoes in one, his walking-stick in another, and his water jar in a third, and one he lived in himself. When he visited a country monastery, and saw the monks with their requisites all ready, he began to talk about the four classes of contented ascetics; 
See Childers, p. 56 
b
. The recluse who is contented with the robes presented to him, with the food, with the bedding, and he who delights in meditation.
 laid hold of their garments, and made them pick up rags from the dust-heap; made them take earthen bowls, and give him any bowls that he fancied and their metal bowls; then he filled a cart with them, and carried them off to Jetavana.


One day people began to talk in the Dhamma Hall. âFriend, Upananda of the Sakka clan, a great eater, a greedy fellow, has been preaching the dispensation to other people, and here he comes with a cartful of monasticsâ property!â The Teacher came in, and wanted to know what they were talking of as they sat there. They told him. âMonks,â said he, âUpananda has gone wrong before by talking about this contentment. But a man ought first of all to become modest in his desires, before praising the good behaviour of other people.

Yourself first stablish in propriety,

Then teach; the wise should not self-seeking be. 
[2.302]

Pointing out this verse from the Dhammapada [Dhp 158], and blaming Upananda, he went on, âThis is not the first time, monks, that Upananda has been greedy. Long ago, he thought even the water in the ocean ought to be saved.â And he told a story of the past.

Who is it that runs about all over this salt water, fending off both the fish and sharks, and harassing the waves?

Being an endless drinker, a dissatisfied bird, famed abroad, I desire to drink the sea, the ocean and the lord of rivers.

The great ocean dwindles away and is filled up again, the end of its drinkingâs not known, the ocean, it seems, is undrinkable.

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time, Upananda was the cormorant, but the DevatÄ was I myself.â

## Full Story
âRipe are the figs.â
 This story the Teacher told at Jetavana, about a certain monk, who had made a hermitage to live in at a certain village on the frontier. This delightful dwelling stood upon a flat rock; a little well-swept spot, with enough water to make it pleasant, a village close at hand to go your rounds in, and friendly people to give food. A monk on his rounds arrived at this place. The elder who lived in it did the duties of host to the new arrival, and next day took him along with him for his rounds. The people gave him food, and invited him to visit them again next day.


After the newcomer had thus fared a few days, he meditated by what means he could oust the other 
{2.445}
 and get hold of the hermitage. Once when he had come 
Reading 
ÄgantvÄ
 (which is surely right).
 to wait upon the elder, he asked, âHave you ever visited the Buddha, friend?â âWhy no, sir; thereâs 
[2.304]
 no one here to look after my hut, or I should have gone before.â âOh, Iâll look after it while you are gone to visit the Buddha,â said the newcomer; and so the owner went, after laying injunctions upon the villagers to take care of the holy monk until his return. The newcomer proceeded to backbite his host, and hinted to the villagers all sorts of faults in him. The other visited his Teacher, and returned; but the newcomer refused him harbourage. He found a place to abide in, and next day went on his rounds in the village. But the villagers would not do their duty by him. He was much discouraged, and went back to Jetavana, where he told the monks all about it.


They began to discuss the matter in their Dhamma Hall, âFriend, monk So-and-so has turned monk So-and-so out of his hermitage, and taken it for himself!â The Teacher came in, and wanted to know what they were discussing as they sat there. They told him. Said he, âMonks, this is not the first time that this man turned the other out of his dwelling,â and he told them a story.

These figs are ripe, the banyan and the wave-leafed fig, come on, letâs go, you should eat, why die from hunger? 
{2.446}

So he is satisfied who respects the elder, as Iâm satisfied today, eating the treeâs fruit.

When woodman would deceive woodman, and monkey would deceive monkey, a young monkey might have faith, but not an old one in ageing monkey.

When the Teacher ended this discourse, he summed up the birth-tale, âAt that time the owner of the hut was the little monkey, the interloper was the big black monkey, but the Tree DevatÄ was I myself.â

 This story the Teacher told in PubbÄrÄma, about some monks who were rude and rough in their manners. These monks, who lived on the floor below that where the Teacher was, talked of what they had seen and heard, and were quarrelsome and abusive. The Teacher called MahÄmoggallÄna to him, and bade him go startle them. The elder rose in the air, and just touched the foundation of the house with his great toe. It shook to the furthest edge of ocean! The monks were frightened to death, and came and stood outside. Their rough behaviour became known among the monks. One day they got to talking about it in the Dhamma Hall. âFriend, there are some monks who have retired to this dispensation which leads to safety, who are rough and rude; they do not see the impermanence, sorrow and unreality of the world, nor do their duty.â The Teacher came in, and asked what they were discussing as they sat there. They told him. âThis is not the first time, monks,â said he, âthat they have been rough and rude. They were the same before.â And he told them a story.

Before your character in our presence, you played repeatedly in this hermitage, monkey, come on, make a monkeyâs grimace, we donât find delight in your character.

By me the supreme purity was heard, from the well learnÃ¨d KomÄraputta, now donât think of me as previously, I live engaged in meditation, friend.

If you should sew a seed upon a rock, the Deva might rain, but it will not grow. By you the supreme purity was heard, far from you, monkey, is absorptionâs ground.

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he declared the Truths, and identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time these monks were the frivolous ascetics, but KomÄyaputta was I myself.â

{2.449}
 This story the Teacher told at Jetavana, about old friendship. The circumstances were the same in detail as in the Vinaya; this is an abstract of them. The venerable Upasena, a two-yearsâ monk, visited 
[2.307]
 the Teacher along with a first yearâs monk who lived in the same monastery; the Teacher rebuked him, and he retired. 
[The circumstances are hardly explained here. The Buddha wanted to go into solitude and a rule was made that no monk should approach him except the one who brought his almsfood. Ven Upasena, not knowing this rule did approach him, and was initially rebuked.]
 He acquired spiritual insight, and became an Arahat, having got contentment and kindred virtues, having undertaken the Thirteen Ascetic Practices, 
[
Dhutaá¹ga
, see Vism 59 ff. 1. the refuse-rag-wearerâs practice, 2. the triple-robe-wearerâs practice, 3. the alms-food-eaterâs practice, 4. the house-to-house-seekerâs practice, 5. the one-sessionerâs practice, 6. the bowl-food-eaterâs practice, 7. the later-food-refuserâs practice, 8. the forest-dwellerâs practice, 9. the tree-root-dwellerâs practice, 10. the open-air-dwellerâs practice, 11. the charnel-ground-dwellerâs practice, 12. the any-bed-userâs practice, 13. the sitterâs practice.]
 and taught them to his fellows, while the Fortunate One was secluded for three months, he with his monks, having accepted the blame first given for wrong speech and nonconformity, received in the second instance approval, in the words, âHenceforth, let any monks visit me when they will, provided they follow the Thirteen Ascetic Practices.â Thus encouraged, he returned and told it to the monks. After that, the monks followed these practices before coming to visit the Teacher; then, when he had come out from his seclusion, they would throw away their old rags and put on clean garments. As the Teacher with all the body of the monks went round to inspect the rooms, 
{2.450}
 he noticed these rags lying about, and asked what they were. When they told him, he said: âMonks, the practice undertaken by these monks is short-lived, like the wolfâs Uposatha day service,â and he told them a story.

Living by killing other beings, feeding on their flesh and blood, the wolf undertaking a vow, established the Uposatha vow.

Sakka, understanding his vow, approached in the form of a goat, impenitent, fallen, the blood-drinker broke his austerity. 
[2.308]
 
{2.451}

So some feeble people here in the world, in their undertaking, quickly make themselves give up like the wolf did because of the goat.

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he identified the JÄtaka as follows, âAt that time I myself was Sakka.â

âOpen the gate.â
 
[3.1] {3.1}
 This story was told by the Teacher while living at Jetavana, about the admission of four female ascetics to the ascetic life.


Tradition says that Licchavis of the ruling family to the number of seven thousand seven hundred and seven had their abode at VesÄlÄ«. And all of them were given to argument and debate.


Now a certain Jain, skilled in maintaining five hundred different theses, arrived at VesÄlÄ« and met with a kind reception there. A female Jain too of a similar character also came to VesÄlÄ« and the Licchavi chiefs got up a debate between them. And when they proved well matched as disputants, the Licchavis were struck with the notion that such a pair would be sure to have clever children. So they arranged a marriage between them, and as the issue of this union in due course four daughters and a son were born. The daughters were named SaccÄ, LolÄ, AvavÄdakÄ, and Paá¹­ÄcÄrÄ, and the boy was called Saccaka. These five children when they reached years of discretion learned a thousand different theses, five hundred from the mother and five hundred from the father. And the parents schooled their daughters in this manner, âIf any layman refutes your thesis, you are to become his wives, but if a monk refutes you, you must take orders at his hands.â


After a time their parents died, and when they were dead, the Jain Saccaka lived on in the same place at VesÄlÄ«, studying the lore of the Licchavis. 
{3.2}
 But his sisters took in their hands a branch of the Jambu plum tree, and in the course of their wanderings from city to city for purposes of debate, at last reached SÄvatthi. There they planted the Jambu plum branch at the city gate and said to some boys who were there, âIf any man, be he layman or monk, is equal to maintaining a thesis against us, let him scatter with his foot this heap of dust and trample under foot this branch.â And with these words they went into the city to collect alms.


Now the venerable SÄriputta, after sweeping up wherever it was necessary, and putting water into the empty pots and tending the sick, later on in the day went into SÄvatthi for alms. And when he had seen and heard about the branch, he ordered the boys to throw it down and trample upon it. âLet those,â said he, âby whom this branch has been planted, as soon as they have finished their meal, come and see me in the gable-chamber over the gate of Jetavana.â 
[3.2]


So he went into the city, and when he had ended his meal, he took his stand in the chamber over the monastery gate. The female ascetics too, after going their rounds for alms, returned and found the branch had been trampled on. And when they asked who had done this, the boys told them it was SÄriputta, and if they were anxious for a debate, they were to go to the chamber over the gate of the monastery.


So they returned to the city, and followed by a great crowd went to the gate-tower of the monastery, and presented to the monk a thousand different theses. The monk solved all their difficulties and then asked them if they knew any more.


They replied, âNo, my Lord.â âThen I,â said he, âwill ask you something.â âAsk on, my Lord,â they said, âand if we know it, we will answer you.â


So the monk presented just one question to them, and when they had to give it up, the monk told them the answer. Then they said: âWe are beaten, the victory rests with you.â


âWhat will you do now?â he asked. âOur parents,â they replied, âadmonished us thus: âIf you are refuted in debate by a layman, you are to become his wives, but if by a monk, you are to receive orders at his handsâ. Therefore, admit us to the ascetic life,â they said.


The monk readily agreed and ordained them near the nun called Uppalavaá¹á¹Ä and all of them shortly became Arahats.


Then one day they started this topic in the Dhamma Hall, how that SÄriputta proved a refuge to the four female ascetics, and that through him they all became Arahats. When the Teacher came and heard the nature of their discourse, he said: âNot only now, but in former times too, SÄriputta proved a refuge to these women. 
{3.3}
 On this occasion he dedicated them to the ascetic life, but formerly he raised them to the dignity of queen consort.â Then he told them a story about the past.

1. âOpen the gate to these maidens: through Nandisenaâs might,

King Arunaâs 
The commentator says Aruna was the real name of the Assaka king.
 sage lion, our city is guarded aright.â 
{3.4}

2. âKÄliá¹gas bold shall victory claim,

Defeat crowns Assakas with shame. 
{3.7}

Thus did your reverence prophesy,

And honest folk should never lie.â

3. âThe gods from lying words are free,

Truth should their chief treasure be.

In this, great Sakka, you did lie;

Tell me, I pray, the reason why.â

4. âHave you, O brahmin, neâer been told

Gods envy not the hero bold?

The fixed resolve that may not yield,

Intrepid prowess in the field,

High courage and adventurous might

For Assaka have won the fight.â 
{3.8}

His discourse ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka, âIn those days these young female ascetics were the daughters of king KÄliá¹ga, SÄriputta was Nandisena and I myself was the ascetic.â

âYour gifts bestowed.â
 
[3.6]
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana, about the elder Änanda. The circumstances that suggested the story have already been given. 
[In Ja 157 
Guá¹ajÄtaka
. I include the story here.]

This was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana how elder Änanda received a present of a thousand robes. The elder had been preaching to the ladies of the king of Kosalaâs palace as described above in the MahÄsÄrajÄtaka [Ja 92].


As he preached there in the manner described, a thousand robes, worth each a thousand pieces of money, were brought to the king. Of these the king gave five hundred to as many of his queens. The ladies put these aside and made them a present to our elder, and then the next day in their old ones went to the palace where the king took breakfast. The king remarked, âI gave you dresses worth a thousand pieces each. Why are you not wearing them?â âMy lord,â they said, âwe have given them to the elder.â âHas elder Änanda got them all?â he asked. They said: âYes, he has.â âThe Supreme Buddha,â said he, âallows only three robes. Änanda is doing a little trade in cloth, I suppose!â


He was angry with the elder; and after breakfast, visited him in his cell, and after greeting, sat down, with these words: âPray, sir, do my ladies learn or listen to your preaching?â


âYes, sire; they learn what they ought, and what they ought to hear, they hear.â


âOh, indeed. Do they only listen, or do they make you presents of upper garments or under-garments?â


âToday, sire, they have given me five hundred robes worth a thousand pieces each.â


âAnd you accepted them, sir?â


âYes, sire, I did.â


âWhy, sir, didnât the Teacher make some rule about three robes?â


âTrue, sire, for every monk three robes is the rule, speaking of what he uses for himself. But no one is forbidden to accept what is offered; and that is why I took them â to give them to monks whose robes are worn out.â


âBut when these monks get them from you, what do they do with their old ones?â


âMake them into a cloak.â


âAnd what about the old cloak?â


âThat they turn into a shirt.â


âAnd the old shirt?â


âThat serves for a coverlet.â


âThe old coverlet?â âBecomes a mat.â âThe old mat?â âA towel.â âAnd what about the old towel?â


âSire, it is not permitted to waste the gifts of the faithful; so they chop up the old towel into bits, and mix the bits with clay, which they use for mortar in building their houses.â


âA gift, sir, ought not to be destroyed, not even a towel.â


âWell, sir king, we destroy no gifts, but all are used somehow.â


This conversation pleased the king so much, that he sent for the other five hundred robes which remained, and gave them to the elder. Then, after receiving his thanks, he greeted the elder in solemn state, and went his way.


The elder gave the first five hundred robes to monks whose robes were worn out. But the number of his fellow monastics was just five hundred. One of these, a young monk, was very useful to the elder; sweeping out his cell, serving him with food and drink, giving him toothbrush and water for cleansing his mouth, looking after the privies, living rooms, and sleeping rooms, and doing all that was needed for hand, foot, or back. To him, as his by right for all his great service, the elder gave all the five hundred robes which he had received afterwards. The young monk in his turn distributed them among his fellow-students. These all cut them up, dyed them yellow as a kaá¹ikÄra flower; then dressed therein they waited upon the Teacher, greeted him, and sat down on one side.


âSir,â they asked, âis it possible for a holy disciple who has entered on the First Path to be a respecter of persons in his gifts?â âNo, monks, it is not possible for holy disciples to be respecters of persons in their gifts.â âSir, our spiritual teacher, the Treasurer of the Dhamma, gave five hundred robes, each worth a thousand pieces, to a young monk; and he has divided them amongst us.â âMonks, in giving these Änanda was no respecter of persons. That young fellow was a very useful servant; so he made the present to his own attendant for the sake of his service, for goodnessâ sake, and by right, thinking that one good turn deserves another, and with a wish to do what gratitude demands.

âIn former days too,â the Teacher said, âwise men acted on the principle that one good turn deserves another.â And hereupon he told them a story of the past.

1. âYour gifts bestowed upon or fool or cheat,

In sorest need would bring no friend to save:


2. But grace or kindness to the good displayed

In sorest need would bring you timely aid.


3. Boons to unworthy souls are spent in vain,

Your smallest service to the good is gain.


4. A noble action though it stands alone,

Renders the doer worthy of a throne:

As fruit abundant from the tiny seed,

Eternal fame springs from a virtuous deed.â 
{3.13}

The Teacher, his discourse ended, thus identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time it was Änanda who dwelt in the frontier village, while I myself was king of Benares.â

âO monarch that once.â
 
[3.9]
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana, about a courtier of the king of Kosala. The circumstances that suggested the story have already been related in the Seyyaá¹sajÄtaka [Ja 282]. 
[The first verse opens: 
Seyyaá¹so seyyaso hoti
. I include the relevant part of the story here.]

This tale the Teacher told at Jetavana, about a courtier of the king of Kosala. This man was very useful to the king, we are told, and did everything that had to be done. Because he was very useful, the king did him great honour. The others were jealous, and concocted a slander, and calumniated him. The king believed their saying, and without enquiring into his guilt, bound him in chains, though virtuous and innocent, and cast him into prison. There he dwelt all alone; but, by reason of his virtue, he had peace of mind, and with mind at peace he understood the conditions of existence, and attained the fruition of the First Path. By and by the king found that he was guiltless, and broke his chains and gave him honour more than before.


The man wished to pay his respects to the Teacher; and taking flowers and perfumes, he went to the monastery, and did reverence to the TathÄgata, and sat respectfully aside. The Teacher talked graciously with him. âWe have heard that ill fortune befell you,â said he. âYes, sir, but I made my ill fortune into good; and as I sat in prison, I produced the fruition of the First Path.â

On this occasion the Teacher said: âYou are not the only one who got good out of evil: wise men of old also got good out of evil.â And he told a story about the past.

1. âO monarch that once in your kingdom did dwell,

Enjoying such bliss as few mortals have seen,

How is it that lying midst tortures of hell

You still are so calm and so gracious of mien?â

2. âOf yore âtwas my one earnest prayer unto heaven

From the ranks of ascetics no more to be barred,

But now that such glory to me has been given,

O why should the form of my visage be marred? 
[3.10]


3. The end is accomplished, my task is now done,

The prince once my foe is no longer estranged,

But now that the fame I so envied is won,

O why should the form of my visage be changed?


4. When 
Compare Lord Houghtonâs poem, âPleasure and Pain.â 
See the Fakeer as he swings on his iron, See the thin Hermit that starves in the wild; Think ye no pleasures the penance environ, And hope the sole bliss by which pain is beguiled? No! In the kingdoms those spirits are reaching, Vain are our words the emotions to tell; Vain the distinctions our senses are teaching, For Pain has its Heaven and Pleasure its Hell
!
 joy turns to sorrow, and weal becomes woe,

Patient souls even pleasure may wring from their pain,

But no such distinction of feeling they know,

When the calm of NibbÄna poor mortals attain.â 
{3.15}

When the Teacher had finished this discourse, he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time Änanda was Dabbasena, and I myself was the king of Benares.â

To think that these poor harmless creatures should dare

A serpent with poisonous fang to defy!â 
{3.17}

2. âAn exile driven to a foreign shore

Must of abuse lay up a goodly store.


3. For where his rank and virtues none can know,

Only the fool his pride would care to show.


4. He who at home a shining light may be,

Abroad must suffer men of low degree.

In the present some newly ordained monks are having lustful thoughts in the nighttime. The Buddha has the monks gathered together and tells them a story of a teacher who promised to give his daughter in marriage to those who stole finery for her in secret. One of his students couldnât bring himself to steal anything, as he knew no wrong doing is ever really done in secret â and he won the daughter.

âIn truth there is.â
 
 {3.18}
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana, about the rebuking of wrong. The circumstances will be set forth in the PÄnÄ«yajÄtaka [Ja 459] in the Eleventh Book. The following is a brief summary of it. 
[There is in fact not much to add to the summary given here, so I cannot include any further details.]


Five hundred monks living in Jetavana, at the close of the middle watch of the night, entered into an argument on the pleasures of sense. Now the Teacher through all the six divisions of night and day keeps a continual watch over the monks, even as a one-eyed man carefully guards his eye, a father his only son, or a yak its tail. In the night time, with his supernatural vision regarding Jetavana, he beheld these monks, as it were, like robbers that had found their way into some great kingâs palace. And opening his perfumed chamber he summoned Änanda and bade him assemble the monks in the part that AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika paved with gold pieces laid side by side, 
[DPPN: 
koá¹­isanthÄra
 was probably the name given to that part of the Jetavana grounds just outside the Buddhaâs own apartments. it may have been so called in reference to the fact that AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika bought the land by spreading on it ten million gold coins â
kahÄpana-koá¹­i-santhÄrena
,â see Ja 148, Introduction.]
 and prepare a seat for him at the door of the perfumed chamber. Änanda did as he was commanded and told the Teacher. Then the Teacher, sitting down on the seat prepared for him, addressed the monks collectively and said: âMonks, wise men of old thought there was no such thing as secrecy in wrong-doing and so refrained from it,â and he told them a story of the past.

1. âIn truth there is no act of wrong, that in this world may hidden lie,

That which the fool a secret deems, the spirits of the wood espy.


2. Concealment nowhere may be found, nor can a void exist for me,

Eâen where no being is in sight, while I am there, no void can be.â

3. âDujjacca, 
The Commentator explains that these were the names of six leading disciples amongst those that yielded to temptation.
 Sujacca, Nando and Sukhavaá¸á¸hita,

Vajja and AddhuvasÄ«la, for a wife, went astray;


4. The brahmin abandoning wrong, perfected in all things,

Won a bride by his courage while holding on to the Truth.â 
{3.20}

The Teacher, having brought this solemn lesson to an end, declared the Truths and identified the JÄtaka. At the conclusion of the Truths these five hundred monks became an Arahat, âAt that time SÄriputta was the Teacher, and I myself was the wise youth.â

## Full Story
âWhat is this egg-shaped fruit.â
 This story was told by the Teacher while dwelling at Jetavana, about queen MallikÄ. One day, they say, there was a dispute at court between her and the king. 
Pasenadi, king of Kosala.
 The king was so enraged that he 
[3.14]
 ignored her existence. MallikÄ thought: âThe Teacher, I fancy, knows not how angry the king is with me.â But the Teacher knew all about it and resolved to make peace between them. So early in the morning he put on his inner garment and taking his bowl and robes he entered SÄvatthi with a following of five hundred monks and came to the palace gate. The king took his bowl from the TathÄgata, brought him into the house, and placing him on the seat prepared for him, poured the Water of Donation on the hands of the Saá¹gha with Buddha at their head, and brought them rice and cakes to eat. But the Teacher covered up his bowl with his hand and said: âSire, where is the queen?â


âWhat have you to do with her, venerable sir?â he answered. âHer head is turned, she is intoxicated with the honour she enjoys.â


âSire,â he said, âafter you yourself bestowed this honour on the woman, it is wrong of you now to get rid of her, and not to put up with the offence she has committed against you.â


The king hearkened to the words of the Teacher and sent for the queen. 
{3.21}


And she ministered to the Teacher. âYou ought,â he said, âto live together in peace,â and singing the praises of the sweets of concord he went his way. And from that day they lived happily together.


The monks raised a discussion in the Dhamma Hall, how that the Teacher had reconciled the king and queen by a single word. The Teacher, when he came, inquired what the monks were discussing, and on being told said: âNot only now, monks, but formerly too I reconciled them by a single word of admonition.â And he told a story of the past.

1. âWhat is this egg-shaped fruit, my lord, so pretty and red of hue,

In a gold dish set before you? Pray tell me, where they grew.â

2. âBare-headed and meanly clad, my queen, you once did feel no shame,

To fill your lap with the jujube fruit, and now you do ask its name;


3. You are eaten up with pride, my queen, you findest no pleasure in life,

Begone and gather your jujubes again. You shall be no longer my wife.â 
[3.15]

4. âThese are the wrongs of a woman, my lord, promoted to high estate:

Forgive her and cease from thine anger, O king, for âtwas you did make her great.â

The Teacher, his lesson ended, identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the king of Kosala was king of Benares, MallikÄ was SujÄtÄ and I myself was the minister.â

âWhy, brahmin, though.â
 
 {3.23}
 The Teacher, when he lay down to enter ParinbbÄna, told this story of the elder Änanda.


The venerable monk, knowing that the Teacher on this very night at eventide would pass away, said to himself, âI am still under discipline and have duties to perform, and my Teacher is certainly going to pass away, and then the service I have rendered to him for five-and-twenty years will be fruitless.â And so being overwhelmed with sorrow he leaned upon the monkey-head which formed the bolt of the garden store-room and burst into tears.


And the Teacher, missing Änanda, asked the monks where he was, and on hearing what was the matter he sent for him and addressed him as follows, âÄnanda, you have laid up a store of merit. Continue to strive earnestly and you will soon be free from human passion. Grieve not thyself. Wherefore should the service you have rendered me prove fruitless now, seeing that your former services in the days of your sinfulness were not without their reward?â Then he told a legend of the past.

1. âWhy, brahmin, though thyself with reason blessed,

Have you this dull insensate tree addressed?

Vain is your prayer, your kindly greeting vain,

From this dull wood no answer will you gain.â

2. âLong on this spot a famous tree has stood,

Meet dwelling-place for spirits of the wood;

With deepest awe such beings I revere,

They guard, I think, some sacred treasure here.â

3. âO brahmin, I have marked your act of love;

A pious deed can never fruitless prove.


4. Lo! Where that fig tree casts its ample shade,

Due sacrifice and gifts of old were paid.

Beneath this fig a buried treasure lies,

The gold unearth, and claim it as your prize.â 
{3.25}

The Teacher here brought his lesson to an end and identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time Änanda was the brahmin, and I myself was the Tree DevatÄ.â

1. âKindness as much as in us lay,

On us in turn, we humbly pray,

Vinaya,

 Here is a brief summary of it.


The Teacher sent for the six monks and asked if it were true that they taught the Dhamma from a low seat, 
See 
Manu
 ii. 198 for the rule that the disciple must sit on a seat lower than his guru.
 while their pupils sat on a higher seat. They confessed that it was so, and the Teacher in reproving these monks for their want of respect for his Dhamma, said that wise men of old had to rebuke men for teaching even heretical doctrines while sitting on a low seat. Then he told them a story.

1. âHoly Teacher, Royal Scholar, lo! the sinful deed I saw,

Both alike from grace are fallen, both alike transgressed Dhamma.â 
The Commentator in his explanation adds this verse: 
True faith of yore prevailed on earth, false Dhamma was a later birth
.
 
{3.29}

2. âMy food is pure rice from the hill,

With a delicate flavour of meat,

For why should a sinner fulfil

A rule meant for saints, when they eat?â

3. âBrahmin, go range the length and breadth of earth;

Lo! Suffering is found the common lot.

Here marred by wrong your ruined life is worth

Less than the fragments of a shattered pot.


4. Beware ambition and oâermastering greed:

Vices like these to worlds of suffering lead.â

So the monks brought him before the Fortunate One. Said the Fortunate One, âIs it true, monk, what I hear, that you are discontented?â He confessed it was so. The Teacher on learning the cause of his discontent said: âWhy, monk, are you longing for the world, after taking ordination in a dispensation that leads to safety? Wise men of old when offered the dignity of being a family priest rejected it, and adopted the ascetic life.â And he told them a story of the past.

1. âNo throne on earth should tempt me to my shame,

No sea-girt realm, safe-guarded in the deep.


2. AccursÃ©d be the lust of wealth and fame

That dooms poor man in suffering worlds to weep.


3. Better through earth a homeless waif to stray,

And bowl in hand to beg from door to door.


4. Than as a king, to sinful sensual desires a prey,

To bear a tyrant rule and vex the poor.â

âRobber, arise.â
 The Teacher, while dwelling in the Bamboo Grove, told this story about the venerable MoggallÄna.


When that elder was living near RÄjagaha in a forest hut, a certain robber, after breaking into a house in a suburban village, fled with his hands full of plunder till he came within the precincts of the elderâs cell, and thinking that he should be safe there he lay down at the entrance of his hut of leaves. The elder noticed him lying there and suspecting his character said to himself, âIt would be wrong for me to have any dealings with a robber.â So coming out of his hut he told him not to lie there, and drove him away.


The robber starting off fled with the greatest haste. And men with torches in their hands, following close upon the robberâs track, came and saw the various spots marked by the presence of the robber and said: âIt was this way the robber came. Here is where he stood. There he sat down. And that is the way he fled. He is not to be seen here.â So they rushed about here and there, but at last had to return without finding him. On the next day early in the morning the elder went his round for alms in RÄjagaha, and on coming back from his rounds he went to the Bamboo Grove and told the Teacher what had happened. The Teacher said: âYou are not the only one, MoggallÄna, to suspect in a case in which suspicion is justified. Wise men of old suspected in like manner.â And at the request of the elder he told a story of bygone times. 
{3.34}

1. âRobber, arise! Why sleepest you? For slumber âtis no time,

The kingâs men are upon you, the avengers of your crime.â

2. âAnd even if this robber bold red-handed they should take,

To you, O Nimb tree, woodland DevatÄ, what difference would it make?â

3. âO Bodhi tree, sure you knowest not the secret of my fear;

I would not have the kingâs men find that wicked robber here.

They from my sacred tree, I know, straightway a branch would take,

And to requite the guilty wretch, impale him on a stake.â 
{3.35}

4. âBeware a danger yet unseen: suspect before too late,

The wise eâen in this present world look to a future state.â

The Teacher, when he had brought this lesson to an end, identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time SÄriputta was the DevatÄ of the Bodhi tree. I myself was the Nimb Tree DevatÄ.â

By and by on the death of his mother, he admitted his father and younger brother to orders, and they took up their abode at Jetavana.


At the opening of the rainy season, hearing of a village retreat where the necessary robes were to be easily obtained, 
Compare 
MahÄvagga,
 iii. 14.
 they all three entered upon the rains residence there, and when it was ended they returned straight to Jetavana. The youthful monk, when they came to a spot not far from Jetavana, told the novice lad to bring on the old man quietly, while he himself pushed on ahead to Jetavana to get ready their cell. The old monk walked slowly on. The novice repeatedly butted him, as it were, with his head, and dragged him along by force, crying, âCome on, Teacher.â The elder said: âYou are pulling me along against my will,â and turning back he made a fresh start from the beginning. As they were thus quarrelling, the sun went down and darkness set in.


The young monk meanwhile swept out his hut, set water in the pots, and not seeing them coming, he took a torch and went to meet them. When he saw them coming, he asked what made them so late. The old man gave the reason. So he made them rest and brought them slowly on their way. That day he found no time to pay his respects to the Buddha. So on the next day, when he had come to pay his respects to Buddha, after he had saluted him and taken his seat, the Teacher asked, âWhen did you arrive?â âYesterday, sir.â âYou came yesterday and pay your respects to me only today?â âYes, sir,â he answered, and told him the reason. The Teacher rebuked the elder, âNot only now does he act like this. Of old too he did just the same. Now it is you that are annoyed by him. Formerly he annoyed wise men.â And at the monkâs request he told a story of the past.

1. âShould foolish youth in word or deed offend,

âTis wisdomâs part long-suffering to display;


2. Quarrels of good men find a speedy end,

Fools part asunder, like untempered clay.


3. Men wise to learn, of defilements aware,

Friendship can prove, that suffers no decay;


4. Such are a brotherâs burden strong to bear,

And strife of neighbours skilful to allay.â 
{3.39}

The Teacher, having brought his lesson to an end, identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the old monk was the father ascetic, the novice was the boy ascetic, and I myself was the son who admonished his father.â

 This story the Teacher, while dwelling at Jetavana, told about a wrathful monk. The incident that gave rise to the story has already been described. 
[But unfortunately the text does not say where.]
 The Teacher asked that monk, saying: âWhy after taking ordination in the dispensation of the Buddha who knows not what wrath is, do you show anger? Wise men in bygone days, though they suffered a thousand stripes, and had their hands and feet and ears and nose cut off, showed no anger against another.â And he then told a story of the past.

1. âWhoso cut off your nose and ear, and lopped off foot and hand,

With him be wroth, heroic soul, but spare, we pray, this land.â

2. âLong live the king, whose cruel hand my body thus has marred,

Pure souls like mine such deeds as these with anger neâer regard.â

3. âA saint of old, as men have told,

Great courage did display:

That saint so strong to suffer wrong

The KÄsi king did slay.


4. Alas, the debt of vain regret

That king will have to pay;

Long will he rue the day.â

The Teacher, his lesson ended, revealed the Truths and identified the JÄtaka. At the conclusion of the Truths the choleric monk attained fruition of the Second Path, while many others attained fruition of the First Path. âAt that time Devadatta was KalÄbu king of KÄsi, SÄriputta was the commander-in-chief, and I myself was the ascetic, who spoke of forbearance.â

In the present the king of Kosala hears cries during the night and is worried what they mean. His brahmins tell him that he needs to give a large animal sacrifice to ward off danger. The Buddha tells of a similar event in a past life, and how the cries had been interpreted as the cries of those in hell, and how he had averted a useless sacrifice.

## Full Story
âDue share of wealth.â
 This story the Teacher, while living at Jetavana, told concerning a king of Kosala. The king of Kosala of those days, they say, one night heard a cry uttered by four inhabitants of hell â the syllables du, sa, na, so, one from each of the four. In a previous existence, tradition says, they had been princes in SÄvatthi, and had been guilty of adultery. After misconducting themselves with their neighboursâ wives, however carefully guarded they might be, and indulging their amorous propensities, their evil life had been cut short by the Wheel of Death, near SÄvatthi. They came to life again in four iron cauldrons. After being tortured for sixty thousand years they had come up to the top, and on seeing the edge of the cauldronâs mouth they thought to themselves, âWhen shall we escape from this misery?â And then all four uttered a loud cry, one after another. The king was terrified to death at the noise, and sat waiting for break of day, unable to stir.


At dawn the brahmins came and inquired after his health. The king replied, âHow, my masters, can I be well, 
{3.44}
 who today have heard four such terrible cries.â The brahmins waved their hands. 
Possibly to avert the evil omen.
 âWhat is it, my masters?â said the king. The brahmins assure him that the sounds are ominous of great violence. âDo they admit of remedy, or not?â said the king. âYou might say not,â said the brahmins, âbut we are well-trained in these matters, sire.â âBy what means,â said the king, âwill you avert these evils?â âSire,â they replied, âthere is one great remedy in our power, and by offering the fourfold sacrifice

 of every living creature we will avert all evil.â âThen be quick,â said the king, âand take all living creatures by fours â men, bulls, horses, elephants, down to quails and other birds â and by this fourfold sacrifice restore my peace of mind.â The brahmins consented, and taking whatever they required, they dug a sacrificial pit and fastened their numerous victims to their stakes, and were highly excited at the thought of the dainties they were to eat, and the wealth they would gain, and went about backwards and forwards, saying: âSir, I must have so and so.â


The queen MallikÄ came and asked the king, why the brahmins went about so delighted and smiling. The king said: âMy queen, what have you to do with this? You are intoxicated with your own glory, and you do not know how wretched I am.â âHow so, sire?â she replied. âI have heard such awful noises, my queen, and when I asked the brahmins what would be the result of 
[3.30]
 my hearing these cries, they told me I was threatened with danger to my kingdom or my property or my life, but by offering the fourfold sacrifice they would restore my peace of mind, and now in obedience to my command, they have dug a sacrificial pit and are gone to fetch whatever victims they require.â The queen said: âHave you, my lord, consulted the chief brahmin in the Deva world as to the origin of these cries?â âWho, lady,â said the king, âis the chief brahmin in the Deva world?â âThe Great Gotama,â she replied, âthe Supreme Buddha.â âLady,â he said: âI have not consulted the Supreme Buddha.â âThen go,â she answered, âand consult him.â


The king hearkened to the words of the queen and after his morning meal he mounted his state chariot and drove to Jetavana. Here after saluting the Teacher he thus addressed him, âVenerable sir, in the night season I heard four cries and consulted the brahmins about it. 
{3.45}
 They undertook to restore my peace of mind, by the fourfold sacrifice of every kind of victim, and are now busy preparing a sacrificial pit. What does the hearing of these cries betoken to me?â


âNothing whatever,â said the Teacher. âCertain beings in hell, owing to the agony they suffer, cried aloud. These cries,â he added, âhave not been heard by you alone. Kings of old heard the same. And when they too, after consulting their brahmins, were anxious to offer sacrifices of slain victims, on hearing what wise men had to say, they refused to do so. The wise men explained to them the nature of these cries, and bade them let loose the crowd of victims and thus restored their peace of mind.â And at the request of the king he told a story of bygone days.

1. â
Du
e share of wealth we gave not; an evil life we led:

We found no sure safe island in joys that now are fled.â

2. â
Sa
d fate of those that suffer! Ah! When shall come release?

Still after countless aeons, hellâs tortures never cease.â 
[3.32]

3. â
Na
y endless are the sufferings to which weâre doomed by fate;

The ills we wrought upon the earth âtis ours to expiate.â

4. â
So
on shall I passing forth from hence, attain to human birth,

And richly dowered with virtue rise to many a deed of worth.â 
{3.48}

The Teacher, having ended his lesson, identified the JÄtaka, âSÄriputta at that time was the young priest, I myself was the ascetic.â

## Full Story
âFor one who is asking.â
 This was a story told by the Teacher, while living at Jetavana, as to how the elder SÄriputta procured dainty fare for some sick monks under medical treatment. The story goes that certain of the monks at that time at Jetavana, after taking oil as a purgative, wished for some dainty food. Those who ministered to them in their sickness went into SÄvatthi to fetch some dainties, but after going their round for alms in a street in the cooksâ quarters, had to come back without getting what they wanted. Later on in the day the elder was going into the town for alms and meeting these monks asked them why they had returned so soon. They told him 
[3.33]
 what had happened. âCome then with me,â said the elder, 
{3.49}
 and took them to the very same street. And the people there gave him a full measure of dainty fare. The attendants brought the food to the sick monks, and they partook of it.


So one day a discussion was started in the Dhamma Hall how that when some servants were leaving a town, without being able to get dainty fare for their sick masters, the elder took them with him on his round for alms in a street in the cooksâ quarters, and sent them home with abundant dainties. The Teacher came up and inquired the nature of their discussion, and on being told what it was he said: âNot only now, monks, did SÄriputta alone obtain food. Formerly also wise men who had a soft voice and knew how to speak pleasantly obtained the same.â And then he told a tale of the olden time.

1. âFor one who is asking a favour, my friend, your language is coarse in its tone,

Such language deserves coarse fare in return, so I offer you mere skin and bone.â

2. âThe name of a brother a strong link is found, to join those akin to each other,

As your kind words suggest the gift I should make, so a joint I present to my brother.â

3. âAs a parentâs fond heart to pity is moved, the cry of âDear fatherâ to hear,

So I too respond to your loving appeal, and give you the heart of the deer.â

4. âA world without friends, I venture to think, a wilderness surely must be,

In that title of friend all thatâs dear is implied, so I give all the deer unto you.â

The Teacher, having ended his lesson, identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time SÄriputta was the Hunter, and I myself was the merchantâs son who had all the venison given to him.â

 This story was told by the Teacher while living at Jetavana, about a gift of all the Buddhist requisites. A certain landowner at SÄvatthi, they say, provided all the requisites for the Saá¹gha with Buddha at its head, and setting up a pavilion at his house door, he invited all the 
[3.35]
 company of monastics with Buddha as their chief, seated them on elegant seats prepared for them, and offered them a variety of choice and dainty food. And saying: âCome again tomorrow,â he entertained them for a whole week, and on the seventh day he presented Buddha and the five hundred monastics under him with all the requisites. At the end of the feast the Teacher, in returning thanks, said: âLay brother, you are right in giving pleasure and satisfaction by this generosity. For this is a tradition of wise men of old, who sacrificed their lives for any beggars they met with, and gave them even their own flesh to eat.â And at the request of his host he related this old world legend.

1. âSeven red fish I safely brought to land from Ganges flood,

O brahmin, eat your fill, I pray, and stay within this wood.â

2. âA lizard and a jar of curds, the keeperâs evening meal,

Two spits to roast the flesh withal I wrongfully did steal:

Such as I have I give to you: O brahmin, eat, I pray,

If you should deign within this wood a while with us to stay.â

3. âAn icy stream, a mango ripe, and pleasant greenwood shade,

âTis thine to enjoy, if you can dwell content in forest glade.â

4. âNor sesame, nor beans, nor rice have I as food to give,

But roast with fire my flesh I yield, if you with us would live.â

The Teacher, when he had ended his lesson, revealed the Truths and identified the JÄtaka. At the conclusion of the Truths the householder, who gave as a free-gift all the Buddhist requisites, attained fruition of the First Path. âAt that time Änanda was the otter, MoggallÄna was the jackal, SÄriputta the monkey, and I myself was the wise hare.â

âWeep for the living.â
 
[3.38]
 The Teacher while in residence at Jetavana told this story of a certain landowner who dwelt at SÄvatthi.


On the death of his brother, it is said, he was so overwhelmed with grief that he neither ate nor washed nor anointed himself, but in deep affliction he used to go to the cemetery at daybreak to weep. The Teacher, early in the morning casting his eye upon the world and observing in that man a capacity for attaining to the fruition of the First Path, thought: âThere is no one but myself that can, by telling him what happened long ago, assuage his grief and bring him to the fruition of the First Path. I must be his refuge.â So next day on returning in the afternoon from his alms round, he took a junior monk and went to his house. On hearing of the Teacherâs arrival, the landowner ordered a seat to be prepared and bade him enter, and saluting him he sat on one side. In answer to the Teacher, who asked him why he was grieving, he said he had been sorrowing ever since his brotherâs death. Said the Teacher, âAll compound existences are impermanent, and what is to be broken will be broken. One ought not to make a trouble of this. Wise men of old, from knowing this, did not grieve, when their brother died.â And at his request the Teacher related this legend of the past.

1. âWeep for the living rather than the dead!

All creatures that a mortal form do take,


2. Four-footed beast and bird and hooded snake,

Yea men and angels all the same path tread.


3. Powerless to cope with fate, rejoiced to die,

âMidst sad vicissitude of bliss and pain,

Why shedding idle tears should man complain,

And plunged in sorrow for a brother sigh?


4. Men versed in fraud and in excess grown old,

The untutored fool, eâen valiant men of might,

If worldly-wise and ignorant of right,

Wisdom itself as foolishness may hold.â 
{3.58}

The Teacher, after he had ended his Dhamma exposition, revealed the Truths and identified the JÄtaka. At the conclusion of the Truths the landowner attained to fruition of the First Path. âAt that time the wise man who by his Dhamma exposition delivered people from their sorrow was I myself.â

## Full Story
â âTwas the joyous time.â
 This was a story told by the Teacher at Jetavana, about a monk who was tempted by thoughts of the wife he had left. The circumstances that led up to the story will be set forth in the IndriyajÄtaka [Ja 423].

The story is that a young man of good family at SÄvatthi heard the Teacherâs preaching, and thinking it impossible to lead a holy life, perfectly complete and pure, as a householder, he determined to become an ascetic in the dispensation which leads to safety and so make an end of misery. So he gave up his house and property to his wife and children, and asked the Teacher to ordain him. The Teacher did so. As he was the junior in his going about for alms with his teachers and instructors, and as the monks were many, he got no chair either in laymenâs houses or in the refectory, but only a stool or a bench at the end of the novices, his food was tossed him hastily on a ladle, he got gruel made of broken lumps of rice, solid food stale or decaying, or sprouts dried and burnt; and this was not enough to keep him alive. He took what he had got to the wife he had left: she took his bowl, saluted him, emptied it and gave him instead well-cooked gruel and rice with sauce and curry.


The monk was captivated by the love of such flavours and could not leave his wife. She thought she would test his affection. One day she had a countryman cleansed with white clay and set down in her house with some others of his people whom she had sent for, and she gave them something to eat and drink. They sat eating and enjoying it. At the house-door she had some bullocks bound to wheels and a cart set ready. She herself sat in a back room cooking cakes. Her husband came and stood at the door. Seeing him, one old servant told his mistress that there was an elder at the door. âSalute him and bid him pass on.â


But though he did so repeatedly, he saw the monk remaining there and told his mistress. She came, and lifting up the curtain to see, she cried, âThis is the father of my sons.â She came out and saluted him: taking his bowl and making him enter she gave him food: when he had eaten she saluted again and said: âSir, you are a saint now: we have been staying in this house all this time; but there can be no proper householderâs life without a master, so we will take another house and go far into the country: be zealous in your good works, and forgive me if I am doing wrong.â For a time her husband was as if his heart would break. Then he said: âI cannot leave you, do not go, I will come back to my worldly life; send a laymanâs garment to such and such a place, I will give up my bowl and robes and come back to you.â She agreed. The monk went to his monastery, and giving up his bowl and robes to his teachers and instructors he explained, in answer to their questions, that he could not leave his wife and was going back to worldly life.


Against his will they took him to the Teacher and told him that he was discontent and wished to go back to worldly life. The Teacher said: âIs this tale true?â âIt is, Lord.â âWho causes you to fall back?â âMy wife.â

The Teacher, addressing this monk, said: âOnce before, through her, you had your head cut off.â And then he related a legend of the past. 
{3.59}

1. â âTwas the joyous time of spring,

Bright with flowers each shrub and tree,

From her swoon awakening

SÄmÄ lives, and lives for thee.â

2. âCan fierce winds a mountain shake?

Can they make firm earth to quake?

But alive the dead to see

Marvel stranger far would be!â 
{3.63}

3. âSÄmÄ surely is not dead,

Nor another lord would wed.

Fasting from all meals but one,

She loves you and you alone.â

4. âSÄmÄâs fancy ever roves

From tried faith to lighter loves:

Me too SÄmÄ would betray,

Were I not to flee away.â

The Teacher, when his lesson was ended, revealed the Truths and identified the JÄtaka. At the conclusion of the Truths the worldly-minded monk attained to fruition of the First Path. âAt that time this monk was the rich merchantâs son, the wife he had left was SÄmÄ, and I myself was the robber.â

## Full Story
âHappy life.â
 
[3.43] {3.64}
 This was a story told by the Teacher while living in the Badarika monastery near KosambÄ«, regarding the elder RÄhula. The introductory story has already been related in full in the TipallatthajÄtaka [Ja 16].

Once when the Teacher was dwelling in the AggÄá¸·ava Temple nearby the town of Äá¸·avi, many female lay-disciples and nuns used to flock there to hear the Dhamma preached. The preaching was in the daytime, but as time wore on, the women did not attend, and there were only monks and men disciples present. Then the preaching took place in the evening; and at the close the elder monks retired each to his own chamber. But the younger ones with the lay-disciples lay down to rest in the Attendance Hall. When they fell asleep, loud was the snoring and snorting and gnashing of teeth as they lay. After a short slumber some got up, and reported to the Fortunate One the impropriety which they had witnessed. Said he, âIf a monk sleeps in the company of novices, it is a PÄcittiya offence (requiring confession).â And after delivering this precept he went away to KosambÄ«.


Thereon the monks said to the venerable RÄhula, âSir, the Fortunate One has laid down this precept, and now you will please find quarters of your own.â Now, before this, the monks, out of respect for the father and because of the anxious desire of the son to observe the rules of the Saá¹gha, had welcomed the youth as if the place were his; they had fitted up a little bed for him, and had given him a cloth to make a pillow with. But on the day of our story they would not even give him house-room, so fearful were they of transgressing.


The excellent RÄhula went neither to the One with Ten Powers as being his father, nor to SÄriputta, Captain of the Dhamma, as being his preceptor, nor to the Great MoggallÄna as being his teacher, nor to the elder Änanda as being his uncle; but betook himself to the One with Ten Powersâ outhouse and took up his abode there as though in a heavenly mansion. Now in the One with Ten Powersâ outhouse the door is always closely shut: the levelled floor is of perfumed earth; flowers and garlands are festooned round the walls; and all night long a lamp burns there. But it was not this splendour which prompted RÄhula to take up his residence here. Nay, it was simply because the monks had told him to find quarters for himself, and because he reverenced instruction and yearned to observe the rules of the Saá¹gha. Indeed, from time to time the monks, to test him, when they saw him coming from quite a distance, used to throw down a hand-broom or a little dust-sweepings, and then ask who had thrown it down, after RÄhula had come in. âWell, RÄhula came that way,â would be the remark, but never did the future elder say he knew nothing about it. On the contrary, he used to remove the litter and humbly ask pardon of the monk, nor go away till he was assured that he was pardoned; so anxious was he to observe the rules. And it was solely this anxiety which made him take up his dwelling in the outhouse.


Now, though day had not yet dawned, the Teacher halted at the door of the outhouse and coughed âAhem.â âAhem,â responded the venerable RÄhula. âWho is there?â said the Buddha. âIt is I, RÄhula,â was the reply; and out came the young man and bowed low. âWhy have you been sleeping here, RÄhula?â âBecause I had nowhere to go to. Up till now, sir, the monks have been very kind to me; but such is their present fear of erring that they wonât give me shelter any more. Consequently, I took up my abode here, because I thought it a spot where I should not come into contact with anybody else.â


Then thought the Teacher to himself, âIf they treat even RÄhula like this, what will they not do to other youths whom they admit to the Saá¹gha?â And his heart was moved within him for the Dhamma. So, at an early hour he had the monks assembled, and questioned the Captain of the Dhamma thus, âI suppose you at all events, SÄriputta, know where RÄhula is now quartered?â


âNo, sir, I do not.â


âSÄriputta, RÄhula was living this day in the outhouse. SÄriputta, if you treat RÄhula like this, what will be your treatment of other youths who go forth in this dispensation? Such treatment will not retain those who join us. In future, keep your novices in your own quarters for a day or two, and only on the third day let them lodge out, taking care to acquaint yourself with their lodging.â With this rider, the Teacher laid down the precept.

Now when the monks in the Dhamma Hall were setting forth the praises of the venerable RÄhula, and speaking of him as fond of instruction, scrupulous and patient of rebuke, the Teacher came up and on hearing from them the subject of their discourse said: âNot only now, but formerly also RÄhula possessed all these virtues.â And then he told them a legend of the past.

1. âHappy life I lead all day,

Food abundant falls to me:

Yet Iâm in a parlous way,

Whatâs my future state to be?â

2. âIf no evil in your heart

Prompts to deed of villainy,

Should you play a passive part,

Guilt attaches not to you.â

3. âLo! Our kinsman: thus they cry,

And in crowds they flock to see.

Am I guilty, should they die?

Please resolve this doubt for me.â 
{3.66}

4. âIf no wrong lurks in the heart,

Innocent the deed will be.

In the present when a landowner is returning to town with his wife she asks him if he would give her anything from a mountain of gold, and he replies he would not. The Buddha tells a story of a prince in exile who said the same thing to his wife, but when he was able to, he gave her dominion over all.

## Full Story
âHe might give.â
 This story was told by the Teacher, while residing at Jetavana, with regard to a certain landowner. According to the story he went to a village with his wife to retrieve a debt, and seizing a cart in satisfaction for what was due to him he deposited it with a certain family, intending to fetch it 
[3.45]
 later on. While on the road to SÄvatthi, they came in sight of a mountain. The wife asked him, âSuppose this mountain were to become all gold, would you give me some of it?â âWho are you?â he replied, âI would not give you a jot.â âAlas,â she cried, âhe is a hard-hearted man. Though the mountain should become pure gold, he would not give me an atom.â And she was highly displeased.


When they drew near to Jetavana, feeling thirsty, they went into the monastery, and had some water to drink. 
{3.67}
 At daybreak the Teacher seeing in them a capacity for emancipation, sat in a cell of his Perfumed Chamber, looking out for their arrival, and emitted the six-coloured Buddha rays. And after they had quenched their thirst, they came to the Teacher and respectfully saluting him sat down. The Teacher, after the usual kindly greetings, asked them where they had been. âWe have been, venerable sir, to call in a debt.â âLay sister,â he said: âI hope your husband is anxious for your good and ready to do you a kindness.â âVenerable sir,â she replied, âI am very affectionate to him, but he has no love for me. Today when I asked him, on catching sight of a mountain, âSupposing it were all pure gold, would you give me some?â he answered, âWho are you? I would not give you a jot.â So hard-hearted is he.â âLay sister,â said the Teacher, âhe talks like this. But whenever he calls to mind your virtues he is ready to give you lordship over all.â âTell us about it, your reverence,â they cried, and at their request he related this legend of the past.

1. âHe might give at little cost

What he would not miss, if lost.

Golden mountains I bestow;

He to all I ask says âNo.â â

2. âWhen you can, say, âYes, I will,â

When you cannot, promise nil.

Broken promises are lies;

Liars all wise men despise.â

3. âStanding fast in righteousness,

You, O prince, we humbly bless.

Fortune may all else destroy;

Truth is still your only joy.â 
{3.70}

4. âKnown to fame as peerless wife,

Sharing weal and woe of life,

Equal she to either fate,

Fit with even kings to mate.â

The Teacher, having ended his lesson, revealed the Truths and identified the JÄtaka. At the conclusion of the Truths, the husband and wife attained to fruition of the First Path. âAt that time this landowner was the king of Benares, this lay sister was the queen, and I myself was the wise councillor.â

## Full Story
âMonkey, in feet.â
 
 {3.71}
 This was a story told by the Teacher while dwelling at Jetavana, about a young disciple who burnt down the hut of leaves of the elder MahÄkassapa. The incident that led to the story originated in RÄjagaha. At that time, they say, the elder was living in a cell in the forest near RÄjagaha. Two young novices ministered to his wants. The one of them was serviceable to the elder, the other was ill-behaved. Whatever was done by his comrade, he made as if it were done by himself. For instance, when the other lad had placed water to rinse the mouth, he goes to the elder and saluting him, says, âSir, the water is ready. Please rinse your mouth.â And when his companion had risen early and swept out the elderâs cell, as soon as the elder appears, he knocks things about here and there, and makes as if the whole cell had been swept out by himself.


The dutiful disciple thought: âThis ill-behaved fellow claims whatever I do just as if he had done it himself. I will expose his cunning behaviour.â So when the young rogue had returned from the village and was sleeping after his meal, he heated water for the bath, and hid it in a back room, and then put merely a small quantity of water in the boiler. The other lad on waking went and saw the steam rising up and thought: âNo doubt our friend has heated the water and put it in the bathroom.â So going to the elder he said: âSir, the water is in the bathroom. Please, take your bath.â The elder went with him to take a bath, and finding no water in the bathroom asked where the water was. The lad went hastily to the heating chamber and let down a ladle into the empty boiler. The ladle struck against the bottom of the empty vessel, and gave forth a rattling sound. (Thenceforth the boy was known by the name of Uá¸·uá¹kasaddaka [Rattle-Ladle.])


At this moment the other lad fetched the water from the back room, and said: âSir, please take your bath.â The elder had his bath, 
{3.72}
 and being now aware of Uá¸·uá¹kaâs misconduct, when the boy came in the evening to wait upon him, he reproached him and said: âWhen one that is under monastic vows 
[3.48]
 has done a thing himself, then only has he the right to say, âI did that.â Otherwise it is a deliberate lie. Henceforth be not guilty of conduct like this.â


The boy was angry with the elder, and next day refused to go into the town with him to beg for alms. But the other youth accompanied the elder. And Uá¸·uá¹ka went to see a family of the elderâs retainers. When they inquired where the elder was, he answered that he remained at home ill. They asked what he ought to have. He said: âGive me so and so,â and took it and went to a place that he fancied, and ate it and returned to the hermitage. Next day the elder visited that family and sat down with them. The people said: âYou are not well, are you? Yesterday, they say, you stopped at home in your cell. We sent you some food by the hand of such and such a lad. Did your reverence partake of it?â The elder held his peace, and when he had finished his meal, returned to the monastery.


In the evening when the boy came to wait upon him, the elder addressed him thus, âYou went begging, sir, in such and such a family, and in such and such a village. And you begged, saying, âThe elder must have so and so to eat.â And then, they say, you ate it yourself. Such begging is highly improper. See that you are not guilty of such misconduct again.â


So the boy for ever so long nursed a grudge against the elder, thinking: âYesterday merely on account of a little water he picked a quarrel with me. And now being indignant because of my having eaten a handful of rice in the house of his retainers, he quarrels with me again. I will find out the right way to deal with him.â And next day, when the elder had gone into the city for alms, he took a hammer and broke all the vessels used for food, and setting fire to the hut of leaves, took to his heels. While still alive he became a Peta in the world of men, and withered away till he died and was born again in the Great Hell of AvÄ«ci. And the fame of his evil deed spread abroad amongst the people.


So one day some monks came from RÄjagaha to SÄvatthi, and after putting away their bowls and robes in a convenient place they went and saluting the Teacher sat down. The Teacher conversed pleasantly with them and asked whence they had come. âFrom RÄjagaha, sir.â âWho is the teacher that preaches there?â he said. âThe Great Kassapa, sir.â âIs Kassapa quite well, monks?â he asked. âYes, venerable sir, the elder is well. But a youthful member of the fraternity was so angry on account of a reproof he gave him, that he set fire to the elderâs hut of leaves, and made off.â 
{3.73}
 The Teacher, on hearing this, said: âMonks, solitude is better for Kassapa than keeping company with a fool like this.â And so saying he repeated a verse in the Dhammapada [Dhp. 61]:

âTo travel with the vulgar herd refuse,

And fellowship with foolish folk eschew;

Your peer or better for a comrade choose

Or else in solitude your way pursue.â

Moreover he again addressed the monks and said: âNot only now, monks, did this youth destroy the hut and feel angry with one that reproved him. In former times too he was angry.â And he then told them a legend of the past.

1. âMonkey, in feet and hands and face

So like the human form,

Why buildest you no dwelling-place,

To hide you from the storm?â

2. âIn feet and hands and face, O bird,

Though close to man allied,

Wisdom, chief boon on him conferred,

To me has been denied.â

3. âHe that inconstancy betrays, a light and fickle mind,

Unstable proved in all his ways, no happiness may find. 
{3.74}


4. Monkey, in virtue to excel, do you your utmost strive,

And safe from wintry blast to dwell, go, hut of leaves contrive.â

The Teacher, having ended his lesson, identified the JÄtaka. âAt that time the youth that fired the hut was the monkey, and I myself was the horned bird.â

These heretics, they say, in various places near Jetavana, made their beds on thorns, suffered the five-fold forms of fire penance, and practised false asceticism of many different kinds. Now a number of the monks, after going their rounds for alms in SÄvatthi, on their way back to Jetavana saw these heretics undergoing their pretended austerities, and came and asked the Teacher, 
{3.75}
 âIs there, sir, any virtue in these heterodox monastics in taking upon them these practices?â The Teacher said: âThere is no 
[3.50]
 virtue, monks, nor any special merit in it. When it is examined and tested, it is like a path over a dunghill, or like the noise the hare heard.â âWe do not know, sir, what that noise was. Tell us, venerable sir.â So at their request he told them a story of the past.

1. âFrom the spot where I did dwell

Issued forth a fearful thud;

What it was I could not tell,

Nor what caused it understood.â

2. âAlarmed at sound of fallen fruit

The other beasts all followed suit

But lent a willing ear

To idle gossip, and were clean

Distraught with foolish fear.

And virtueâs heights attain,

Though ill example should invite,

Such panic fear disdain.â

âSuch is the quality.â
 This story was told by the Teacher, while dwelling in the AggÄá¸·ava shrine near Äá¸·avÄ«, concerning the regulations to be observed in the building of cells. 
See 
Suttavibhaá¹ga
 vi. 1.
 The introductory story has already been set forth in the Maá¹ikaá¹á¹­hajÄtaka [Ja 253].

Some monks who lived in Äá¸·avÄ« were begging from all quarters the materials for houses which they were getting made for themselves. They were for ever asking, âGive us a man, give us somebody to do servantâs work,â and so forth. Everybody was annoyed at this begging and solicitation. So much annoyed were they, that at sight of these monks they were startled and scared away.


It happened that the venerable monk MahÄkassapa entered Äá¸·avÄ«, and traversed the place in quest of alms. The people, as soon as they saw the elder, ran away as before. After mealtime, having returned from his rounds, he summoned the monks, and thus addressed them, âOnce Äá¸·avÄ« was a good place for alms; why is it so poor now?â They told him the reason.


Now the Fortunate One was at the time dwelling at the AggÄá¸·ava shrine. The elder came to the Fortunate One, and told him all about it.

But on this occasion the Teacher said: âIs it true, monks, that you live here by your importunity in asking and begging for alms?â And when they answered, âYes,â he reproved them and said: âWise men of old, when offered their choice by the king, though they were longing to ask for a pair of single-soled shoes, through fear of doing violence to their sensitive and scrupulous nature, did not venture to say a word in the presence of the people, but spoke in private.â And so saying he told them a story of the past.

1. âSuch is the quality of prayer, O king,

âTwill a rich gift or a refusal bring.

3. Lest people see us shed the idle tear,

My prayer I whisper in your secret ear.â

4. âBrahmin, I offer you a thousand kine,

Red kine, and eke the leader of the herd;

Hearing but now these generous words of thine,

I too in turn to generous deed am stirred.â

The Teacher, having ended his lesson, identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time Änanda was the king, and I myself was the ascetic.â

âThe kindly beast.â
 
[3.55] {3.82}
 This story was told by the Teacher while living at Jetavana, about CammasÄá¹­aka, a mendicant monk who wore a leather jacket. 
MahÄvagga,
 viii. 28. 2. 
 Both his upper and under garment, it is said, were of leather. One day sallying out of the monastery, he went his rounds in SÄvatthi for alms, till he came to the fighting-ground of the rams. A ram on seeing him drew back, desiring to butt him. The mendicant thought: âHe is doing this, as an act of respect for me,â and himself did not draw back. The ram came on with a rush and striking him on the thigh felled him to the ground. This case of imaginary salutation was blazed abroad in the Saá¹gha.


The matter was discussed by them in the Dhamma Hall, as to how the leather-coated mendicant fancied he was being saluted and met with his death. The Teacher came and inquired into the subject of their discussion and on being told what it was said: âNot only now, monks, but of old too this ascetic imagined he was being saluted and so came by his death,â and he then related to them a story of the past.

1. âThe kindly beast obeisance makes before

The high-caste brahmin versed in holy lore.

Good honest creature you,

Famous above all other beasts, I vow!â 
{3.83}

2. âBrahmin, be not so rash this beast to trust,

Else will he haste to lay you in the dust,

For this the ram falls back,

To gain an impetus for his attack.â

3. âWith broken leg and bowl for alms upset,

His damaged fortune he will sore regret.

Let him not weep with outstretched arms in vain,

Haste to the rescue, ere the monk is slain.â

4. âThus all that honour to the unworthy pay,

Share the same fate that I have met today;

Prone in the dust by butting ram laid low

To foolish confidence my death I owe.â 
{3.84}

The Teacher, his lesson ended, thus identified the JÄtaka, âThe man in the leather coat of today was the same then as now. And I myself was the wise merchant.â

But on this occasion they brought the monk to the Teacher and exposed him, saying: âVenerable sir, this monk is a cheat.â The Teacher said: âNot only now, but formerly also he was a rogue.â And then he told a story about the past.

1. âThinking himself an ascetic,

having a lack of self-control,

you beat me with a stick,

In the present when one laymanâs wife dies he is inconsolable. The Buddha tells a story about a young couple who were brought together through a golden image and forced to marry. They lived in celibacy, and when their parents died, took up the ascetic life. When the wife died her former husband grieved not, knowing impermanence is the way of compounded things.

## Full Story
âWhy should I shed tears.â
 This story was told by the Teacher while living at Jetavana, of a certain landowner who had lost his wife. On her death, they say, he neither washed himself nor took food, and neglected his farm duties. Overcome with grief he would wander about the cemetery lamenting, while the basis to enter the First Path blazed forth like a halo about his head. The Teacher, early one morning, casting his eye upon the world and beholding him said: âExcept for me there is no one that can remove this manâs sorrow and bestow upon him the power of entering the First Path. I will be his refuge.â So when he had returned from his rounds and had eaten his meal, he took an attendant monk and went to the door of the landownerâs house. 
{3.93}
 And he on hearing that the Teacher was coming went out to meet him, and with other marks of respect seated him in the prescribed seat and came and sitting on one side saluted him.


The Teacher asked, âWherefore, lay brother, are you silent?â âVenerable sir,â he replied, âI am grieving for her.â


The Teacher said: âLay brother, that which is breakable is broken, but when this happens, one ought not to grieve. Sages of old, when they lost a wife, knew this truth, and therefore sorrowed not.â And then at his request the Teacher told a story of the past.


The old legend will be found set forth in the CullabodhijÄtaka [Ja 443] in the Tenth Book. Here follows a short summary of it.

1. âWhy should I shed tears for you,

Fair SammillabhÄsinÄ«?

Passed to deathâs majority 
Compare the classical usage of Î¿á¼° ÏÎ»ÎµÎ¯Î¿ÏÏ, 
plures
, for the dead.

You are henceforth lost to me.


2. Wherefore should frail man lament

What to him is only lent?

He too draws his mortal breath

Forfeit every hour to death.


3. Be he standing, sitting still,

Moving, resting, what he will,

In the twinkling of an eye,

In a moment death is nigh.


4. Life I count a thing unstable,

Loss of friends inevitable.

Cherish all that are alive,

Sorrow not should you survive.â 
{3.97}

The Teacher, having ended his lesson, revealed the Truths and identified the JÄtaka. At the conclusion of the Truths, the landowner attained to fruition of the First Path. âAt that time the mother of RÄhula was SammillabhÄsinÄ«, and I myself was the ascetic.â

## Full Story
âOnce we enjoyed.â
 
[3.65]
 This was a story told by the Teacher while dwelling in the Bamboo Grove, with regard to Devadattaâs loss of gains and honour. For when Devadatta had unreasonably conceived a grudge against the TathÄgata and instigated a band of archers to slay him, his offence became known by the letting loose of the elephant NÄlÄgiri. 
See vol. ii. p. 140, and p. 168.
 Then men took away his office and the rations provided for him, and the king ceased to regard him. And having lost his source of gains and honour, he went about living on what he begged in noble families.


The monks started a discussion in the Dhamma Hall, how that Devadatta thought to get gain and honour, but when he had got it he could not keep it. The Teacher came and inquired what was the subject the monks sat in a meeting to discuss, and on being told what it was he said: âNot only now, monks, but formerly too, Devadatta was deprived of gains and honour.â And he then told them a story of the past.

1. âOnce we enjoyed of food abundant store,

This monkey now has what was ours before.

Come, RÄdha, let us to the forest hie;

Such scurvy treatment what can justify?â 
[3.66]

2. âGain and loss and praise and blame,

Pleasure, pain, dishonour, fame,

All as transient states conceive â

Why should Poá¹­á¹­hapÄda grieve?â 
{3.99}

3. âRÄdha, wisest bird alive,

Sure you knowest things to come,

This vile creature who shall drive

From the court to his old home?â

4. âOft will his puckered face and moving ears

The royal children fill with foolish fears:

Soon KÄlabÄhu through some impish freak,

Far far away his food will have to seek.â

The Teacher here ended his lesson and identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time Devadatta was KÄlabÄhu, Änanda was Poá¹­á¹­hapÄda, and I myself was RÄdha.â

In the present a brahmin seeks to find out if the king favours him for his birth, or for his goodness, so he starts stealing a penny a day from the king. When the king finds out he decides to punish him, until the brahmin explains his actions.

## Full Story
âPower on earth.â
 This was a story told by the Teacher when at Jetavana, about a brahmin who was ever proving his virtue. Two similar stories have been told before. 
Ja 86 and Ja 290 [I include the story here.]

This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a brahmin who put to the test his reputation for virtue. This brahmin, who was maintained by the king of Kosala, had sought the Three Refuges; he kept the Five Precepts, and was versed in the Three Vedas. âThis is a virtuous man,â thought the king, and showed him great honour. But that brahmin thought to himself, âThe king shows honour to me beyond other brahmins, and has manifested his great regard by making me his spiritual director. But is his favour due to my virtue or only to my birth, lineage, family, country and accomplishments? I must clear this up without delay.â


Accordingly, one day when he was leaving the palace, he took without permission a coin from a treasurerâs counter, and went his way. Such was the treasurerâs veneration for the brahmin that he sat perfectly still and said not a word. Next day the brahmin took two coins; but still the official made no remonstrance. The third day the brahmin took a whole handful of coins. âThis is the third day,â cried the treasurer, âthat you have robbed his majesty,â and he shouted out three times, âI have caught the thief who robs the treasury.â In rushed a crowd of people from every side, crying, âAh, youâve long been posing as a model of virtue.â And dealing him two or three blows, they led him before the king. In great sorrow the king said to him, âWhat led you, brahmin, to do so wicked a thing?â And he gave orders, saying: âOff with him to punishment.â âI am no thief, sire,â said the brahmin. âThen why did you take money from the treasury?â âBecause you showed me such great honour, sire, and because I made up my mind to find out whether that honour was paid to my birth and the like or only to my virtue. That was my motive, and now I know for certain (inasmuch as you order me off to punishment) that it was my virtue and not my birth and other advantages, that won me your majestyâs favour.


Virtue I know to be the chief and supreme good; I know too that to virtue I can never attain in this life, while I remain a layman, living in the midst of sensual pleasures. Wherefore, this very day I would willingly go to the Teacher at Jetavana and renounce the world for the Saá¹gha. Grant me your leave, sire.â The king consenting, the brahmin set out for Jetavana. His friends and relations in a body tried to turn him from his purpose, but, finding their efforts of no avail, left him alone.


He came to the Teacher and asked to be admitted to the Saá¹gha. After admission to the lower and higher ordination, he won by application insight and became an Arahat, whereon he drew near to the Teacher, saying: âSir, my joining the Saá¹gha has borne the Supreme Fruit,â thereby signifying that he had became an Arahat.


Hearing of this, the monks, assembling in the Dhamma Hall, spoke with one another of the virtues of the kingâs family priest who tested his own reputation for virtue and who, leaving the king, had now risen to be an Arahat. Entering the Hall, the Teacher asked what the monks were discussing, and they told him. âNot without a precedent, monks,â said he, âis the action of this brahmin in putting to the test his reputation for virtue and in working out his safety after renouncing the world. The like was done by the wise and good of bygone days as well.â And so saying, he told this story of the past.

1. âPower on earth beyond compare,

Virtue owns a wondrous charm:

Putting on a virtuous air

Deadly snakes avoid all harm.â

2. âWhile the hawk had aught to eat,

Birds of prey pecked at him sore,

When perforce he dropped the meat,

Then they pecked at him no more.â 
{3.101}

3. âThe fruit of hope fulfilled is bliss;

How differs loss of hope from this?

Though dull despair her hope destroys,

Lo! Piá¹galÄ calm sleep enjoys.â

Aphorisms,
 iv. 11 [which reads: 
He who is without hope, is happy, just like Piá¹galÄ

4. âIn this world and in worlds to be

Nought can surpass concentration:

To holy calm a devotee,

Himself unharmed, will none annoy.â 
{3.102}

The Teacher, having ended his lesson, identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time I myself was the family priest.â

## Full Story
âThey that with speech inopportune.â
 This story was told by the Teacher at Jetavana about KokÄlika. The introductory story is told in full in the TakkÄrikajÄtaka [Ja 481].

During one rainy season the two chief disciples, desiring to leave the multitude and to dwell apart, took leave of the Teacher, and went into the kingdom where KokÄlika was. They repaired to the residence of KokÄlika, and said this to him, âMonk KokÄlika, since for us it is delightful to dwell with you, and for you to dwell with us, we would abide here three months.â âHow,â said the other, âwill it be delightful for you to dwell with me?â They answered, âIf you tell not a soul that the two chief disciples are dwelling here, we shall be happy, and that will be our delight in dwelling with you.â âAnd how is it delightful for me to dwell with you?â âWe will teach the Dhamma to you for three months in your home, and we will discourse to you, and that will be your delight in dwelling with us.â âDwell here, monks,â said he, âso long as you will,â and he allotted a pleasant residence to them. There they dwelt in the fruition of the Attainments, and no man knew of their dwelling in that place.


When they had thus past the rains they said to him, âMonk, now we have dwelt with you, and we will go to visit the Teacher,â and asked his leave to go. He agreed, and went with them on the rounds for alms in a village over against the place where they were. After their meal the elders departed from the village. KokÄlika leaving them, turned back and said to the people, âLay brethren, you are like brute animals. Here the two chief disciples have been dwelling for three months in the monastery opposite, and you knew nothing of it: now they are gone.â âWhy did you not tell us, sir?â the people asked.


Then they took ghee and oil and medicines, raiment and clothes, and approached the elders, saluting them and saying: âPardon us, sirs we knew not you were the chief disciples, we have learned it but today by the words of the venerable monk KokÄlika. Pray have compassion on us, and receive these medicines and clothes.â KokÄlika went after the elders with them, for he thought: âThe elders are frugal, and content with little; they will not accept these things, and then they will be given to me.â But the elders, because the gift was offered at the instigation of a monk, neither accepted the things themselves nor had them given to KokÄlika. The lay folk then said: âSirs, if you will not accept these, come here once again to bless us.â The elders promised, and proceeded to the Teacherâs presence.


Now KokÄlika was angry, because the elders neither accepted those things themselves, nor had them given to him. The elders, however, having remained a short while with the Teacher, each chose five hundred monks as their following, and with these thousand monks went on pilgrimage seeking alms, as far as KokÄlikaâs country. The lay folk came out to meet them, and led them to the same monastery, and showed them great honour day by day.


Great was the store given them of clothes and of medicines. Those monks who went out with the elders dividing the garments gave of them to all the monks which had come, but to KokÄlika gave none, neither did the elders give him any. Getting no clothes KokÄlika began to abuse and revile the elders, âSÄriputta and MoggallÄna are full of wicked desire; they would not accept before what was offered them, but these things they do accept. There is no satisfying them, they have no regard for another.â But the elders, perceiving that the man was harbouring evil on their account, set out with their followers to depart; nor would they return, not though the people begged them to stay yet a few days longer.


Then a young monk said: âWhere shall the elders stay, laymen? Your own particular elder does not wish them to stay here.â Then the people went to KokÄlika, and said: âSir, we are told you do not wish the elders to stay here. Go to! Either appease them and bring them back, or away with you and live elsewhere!â In fear of the people this man went and made his request to the elders. âGo back, monk,â answered the elders, âwe will not return.â So he, being unable to prevail upon them, returned to the monastery. Then the lay brethren asked him whether the elders had returned. âI could not persuade them to return,â said he. âWhy not, monk?â they asked. And then they began to think it must be no good monks would dwell there because the man did wrong, and they must get rid of him. âSir,â they said, âdo not stay here; we have nothing here for you.â


Thus dishonoured by them, he took bowl and robe and went to Jetavana. After saluting the Teacher, he said: âSir, SÄriputta and MoggallÄna are full of wicked desire, they are in the power of wicked desires!â The Teacher replied, âSay not so, KokÄlika; let your heart, KokÄlika, have confidence in SÄriputta and MoggallÄna; learn that they are good monks.â KokÄlika said: âYou believe in your two chief disciples, sir; I have seen it with my own eyes; they have wicked desires, they have secrets within them, they are wicked men.â So he said thrice (though the Teacher would have stayed him), then rose from his seat, and departed. Even as he went on his way there arose over all his body boils of the size of a mustard seed, which grew and grew to the size of a ripe seed of the wood apple tree, burst, and blood ran all over him. Groaning he fell by the gate of Jetavana, maddened with pain.


A great cry arose, and reached even to the Brahma Realm, âKokÄlika has reviled the two chief disciples!â Then his spiritual teacher, the Brahma Tudu by name, learning the fact, came with the intent of appeasing the elders, and said while poised in the air, âKokÄlika, a cruel thing this you have done; make your peace with the chief disciples.â âWho are you, brother?â the man asked. âTudu Brahma, is my name,â said he. âHave you not been declared by the Fortunate One,â said the man, âone of those who return not? That word means that such come not back to this earth. You will become a Yakkha upon a dunghill!â Thus he upbraided the MahÄbrahma. And as he could not persuade the man to do as he advised, he replied to him, âMay you be tormented according to your own word.â Then he returned to his abode of bliss. And KokÄlika after dying was born again in the Lotus Hell. That he had been born there the great and mighty Brahma told to the TathÄgata, and the Teacher told it to the monks.


In the Dhamma Hall the monks talked of the manâs wickedness, âMonks, they say KokÄlika reviled SÄriputta and MoggallÄna, and by the words of his own mouth came to the Lotus Hell.â The Teacher came in, and said he, âWhat speak you of, monks, as you sit here?â They told him. Then he said: âThis is not the first time, monks, that KokÄlika was destroyed by his own word, and out of his own mouth was condemned to misery; it was the same before.â And he told them a story.

1. âThey that with speech inopportune offend

Like the young cuckoo meet untimely end.


2. Nor deadly poison, nor sharp-whetted sword

Is half so fatal as ill-spoken word.


3. The sage his measured words discreetly guides,

Nor rashly to his second self confides:


4. Before he speaks will prudent counsel take,

His foes to trap, as Garuá¸·a the snake.â 
{3.104}

The Teacher, having brought his lesson to an end, identified the JÄtaka, âKokÄlika in those days was the young cuckoo, and I myself was the wise minister.â

âWounding another.â
 This story was told by the Teacher when he was at Jetavana, about the family priest of the king of Kosala, who, it is said, as he was driving in his chariot to a village on his estate came upon a caravan in a narrow road, and crying out once and again, âOut of the way with you,â was so enraged at a cart not clearing out of his way that he threw his goad-stick at the driver of the first cart. The stick struck against the yoke of the chariot, and rebounding hit him on the forehead and raised a bump on his head. The priest turned back and went and told the king he had been wounded by some carters. The carters were summoned, and the judges examining into the case found the priest only was to blame.


One day the matter was discussed in the Dhamma Hall, 
[3.70] {3.105}
 how that the kingâs family priest, who said he had been assaulted by some carters, on going to law lost the suit. When the Teacher came and inquired what the monks were sitting in council to discuss, on hearing what it was he said: âNot only now, monks, but formerly also this fellow acted in precisely the same way.â And he then told them a story of the past.

1. âWounding another, his own wound he shows,

Himself the smiter, he complains of blows.


2. Wise men, O king, of partial views beware,

Hear both sides first, then judgment true declare.

4. The warrior prince a well-weighed verdict gives,

Of righteous judge the fame for ever lives.â

[3.71]
 This is a story told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, of a certain landowner. The introductory story has been told in full before. 
See Ja 320 [the introduction is so changed by what follows there is nothing to add.]


According to the story he went to a village with his wife to retrieve a debt, and seizing a cart in satisfaction for what was due to him he deposited it with a certain family, intending to fetch it later on.


But in this case, as the husband and wife were returning home, after calling in a debt, in the course of their journey some hunters gave them a roasted lizard, bidding them both to eat of it. The man sent his wife to fetch water and ate up the whole lizard, and when she came back, he said: âMy dear, the lizard has run away.â âWell, my lord,â she said, âwhat can one do with a roasted lizard that runs away?â 
{3.107}
 She drank some water and afterwards at Jetavana when sitting in the presence of the Teacher, she was asked by him as follows, âLay sister, is this man affectionate, loving and helpful to you?â She answered, âI am loving and affectionate to him, but he has no love for me.â The Teacher said: âWell, suppose he does behave thus to you. Do not be grieved. When he recalls to mind your virtues, he will give supreme power to you alone.â And at their request he related a story about the past.

1. âThen were you first known to me,

When in forest-depths, O king,

Roasted lizard broke its string

And from Bodhi tree branch got free.

Though âneath robe of bark, I think,

Sword and coat of mail were seen.â

2. âTo one that honours you, due honour show

With full requital of good service done:

No kindness on illiberal folk bestow,

Nor those affect that would your presence shun.


3. Forsake the wretch who has forsaken you,

And love not one who has for you no love,

Eâen as a bird forsakes a barren tree,

And seeks a home in some far distant grove.â 
{3.109}

4. âFar as in his power may be,

Gratitude a king should show:

All my realm I grant to you,

Gifts, on whom you will, bestow.â

The Teacher, having brought his lesson to an end, identified the JÄtaka. At the conclusion of the Truths, both husband and wife attained fruition of the First Path. âThe husband and wife of the present story played the same part in the old tale. But I myself was the wise minister.â

No bribe can move relentless death, no kindness mollify,

No one in fight can vanquish death. For all are doomed to die.

But in this version of it the Teacher said: âKings of old, sire, hearkening to the words of the wise, ruled justly and attained to the heavenly world.â And at the request of the king he told a story of the past.

1. âThe bull through floods a devious course will take,

The herd of cows all straggling in his wake:


2. So if a leader tortuous paths pursue,

To base ends will he guide the vulgar crew,

And the whole realm an age of license rue.


3. But if the bull a course direct should steer,

The herd of cows straight follow in his rear.


4. So should their chief to righteous ways be true,

The common folk injustice will eschew,

And through the realm shall holy peace ensue.â 
{3.112}

The Teacher, having ended his lesson, identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time Änanda was the king, and I myself was the ascetic.â

## Full Story
âJackal beware.â
 This story was told by the Teacher while dwelling in the Bamboo Grove, about the attempt of Devadatta to imitate the Buddha. The incident that gave rise to the story has been told in full before. 
Ja 204 [Despite the following statement, the story at Ja 204 hardly elaborates on what is told here.]
 Here is a short summary of it. 
[3.75]


When the Teacher asked SÄriputta what Devadatta did when he saw him, the elder replied, âSir, in imitating you he put a fan in my hand and lay down, and then KokÄlika struck him on the breast with his knee: and so by imitating you he got into trouble.â The Teacher said: âThis happened to Devadatta before,â and being pressed by the elder, he told a story of the past.

1. âJackal, beware!

His tusks are long.

One of your puny race

Would scarcely dare

So huge and strong

A beast as this to face.â

2. âA jackal once assumed the lionâs pride,

And elephant as equal foe defied.

Prone on the earth, while groans his bosom rent,

He learned the rash encounter to repent. 
[3.76]


3. Who thus should challenge one of peerless fame,

Nor mark the vigour of his well-knit frame,

Shares the sad fate that on the jackal came.


4. But who the measure of his own power knows,

And nice discretion in his language shows,

True to his duty lives and triumphs oâer his foes.â 
{3.115}

The Teacher, having ended his lesson, identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time Devadatta was the jackal, and I myself was the lion.â

[The

UddÄlajÄtaka

This story the Teacher told, while dwelling in Jetavana, about a dishonest monk. This man, even though dedicated to the dispensation that leads to safety, notwithstanding to gain lifeâs necessaries fulfilled the threefold cheating practice [seeking requisites, seeking honour and hinting].


The monks brought to light all the evil parts in the man as they conversed together in the Dhamma Hall, âSuch a one, monks, after he had dedicated himself to this dispensation which leads to safety, yet lives in deceit!â The Teacher came in, and would know what they talked of there. They told him. Said he, âThis is not now the first time; he was deceitful before,â and so saying he told a story of the past.

1. âGrass is still your constant cry;

Who did take your grass away?

What your need of it, or why

Do you this word only say?â

2. âChatta, holy man of fame,

As it happened this way came:

Him alone to blame I hold,

Substituting grass for gold.â 
{3.118}

3. âCanny folk their rule should make,

Little give and much will take.

What he took was all his own,

What he left was grass alone.â

4. âVirtue follows no such rules,

These are morals fit for fools.

Doubtful morals they must be,

Learning too is vanity.â

The Teacher here ended his lesson and identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the cheating monk was the BrahÄchatta, and I myself was the wise minister.â

## Full Story
âAlas, we offered you.â
 This story the Teacher told while living at Jetavana, about a certain monk. He came, it was said, from the country to Jetavana, and, after putting away his bowl and robe, he saluted the Teacher and inquired of the young novices, saying: âSirs, who look after the visiting monks that come to SÄvatthi?â 
{3.119}
 âThe Treasurer AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika,â they said, âand the great and holy lay sister VisÄkhÄ look after the order of the monks, and stand in the place of father and mother to them.â âVery good,â 
[3.79]
 he said, and next day quite early, before a single monk had entered the house, he came to AnÄthapiá¹á¸ikaâs door. From his having come at an unseasonable hour there was no one to attend to him. Without getting anything there he went off to the door of VisÄkhÄâs house. There also from having come too early, he got nothing. After wandering here and there he came back, and finding the rice-gruel was all finished, he went off. Again he wandered about here and there, and on his return, finding the rice all finished, he went back to the monastery, and said: âThe monks here speak of these two families as faithful believers, but both of them really are without faith and unbelievers.â Thus did he go about abusing these families.


So one day they started a discussion in the Dhamma Hall, how that a certain monk from the country came to the door of certain households too early, and failing to obtain alms went about reviling those families. When the Teacher came and inquired what was the topic the monks were sitting to discuss, on hearing what it was, he called the monk and asked him if it were true. When the monk said: âYes, your reverence, it is true,â the Teacher asked, âWhy are you angry, monk? Of old, before Buddha arose upon the world, even ascetics when they visited a household and received no alms, showed no anger.â And with this he told a story of the olden days.

1. âAlas, we offered you no seat,

No water brought, nor anything to eat:

We here confess our sinfulness,

And pardon humbly, venerable sir, entreat.â 
[3.80]

2. âNought have I to condone,

No anger do I feel,

The thought just once I own

Across my mind did steal,

Habits of people here

Are just a trifle queer.â

3. âThe custom of our family â âtwas so

Received by us from ages long ago â


4. Is to provide the stranger with a seat,

Supply his needs, bring water for his feet

And every guest as kinsman dear to treat.â 
{3.121}

The Teacher, having ended his lesson, revealed the Truths and identified the JÄtaka. At the conclusion of the Truths the monk attained fruition of the First Path. âAt that time Änanda was the merchant of Benares, and I myself was the ascetic.â

## Full Story
âWith sense so nice.â
 This story was told by the Teacher while living in the Bamboo Grove, of prince AjÄtasattu. At the time of his conception there arose in his mother, the daughter of the king of Kosala, a chronic longing to drink blood from the right knee of (her husband) king BimbisÄra. 
Compare 
Tibetan Tales
 vi. Prince JÄ«vaka.
 Being questioned by her attendant ladies, she told them how it was with her. The king too hearing of it called his astrologers and said: âThe queen is possessed of such and such a longing. What will be the issue of it?â The astrologers said: âThe child conceived in the womb of the queen will kill you and seize your kingdom.â âIf my son,â said the king, âshould kill me and seize my kingdom, what is the harm of it?â And then he had his right knee opened with a sword and letting the blood fall into a golden dish gave it to the queen to drink. She thought: âIf the son that is born of me should kill his father, what care I for him?â and endeavoured to bring about a miscarriage. 
{3.122}
 The king hearing of it called her to him and said: âMy dear, it is said, my son will slay me and seize my kingdom.
 [3.81]
 But I am not exempt from old age and death: suffer me to behold the face of my child. Henceforth act not after this manner.â But she still went to the garden and acted as before. The king on hearing of it forbade her visits to the garden, and when she had gone her full time she gave birth to a son. On his naming-day, because he had been his fatherâs enemy, while still unborn, they called him prince AjÄtasattu [Unborn Enemy].


As he grew up with his princely surroundings, one day the Teacher accompanied by five hundred monks came to the kingâs palace and sat down. The assembly of the monks with Buddha at their head was entertained by the king with choice food, both hard and soft. And after saluting the Teacher the king sat down to listen to the Dhamma. At this moment they dressed up the young prince and brought him to the king. The king welcomed the child with a strong show of affection and placed him on his lap, and fondling the boy with the natural love of a father for his child, he did not listen to the Dhamma. The Teacher observing his inattention said: âGreat king, formerly kings when suspicious of their sons had them kept in a secret place, and gave orders that at their death they were to be brought forth and set upon the throne.â And at the request of the king he told him a story of the past.

1. âWith sense so nice, the husks from rice

Rats keen are to discriminate:

They cared not much the husks to touch,

But grain by grain the rice they ate.â 
[3.82]

2. âThe secret counsel taken in the wood

By me is understood:

The village plot soft whispered in the ear

That too I hear.â

3. âA monkey once did cruel measures take

His tender offspring impotent to make.â

4. âYour cautious creeping ways

Like one-eyed goat in mustard field that strays,

And who you are that lurkest here below,

This too I know.â

The Teacher here ended his lesson and said: âThus, sire, kings of old suspected in cases in which suspicion was justified,â and related this incident, 
{3.126}
 but the king gave no heed to his words. The Teacher thus identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the far-famed teacher at Taxila was I myself.â

## Full Story
âBefore the crested peacock.â
 This story was told by the Teacher when at Jetavana, of certain heretics who lost their former gains and glory. For the heretics who before the birth of Buddha received gain and honour, lost the same at his birth, becoming like fireflies at sunrise. Their fate was discussed in the Dhamma Hall. When the Teacher came and inquired what was the topic the monks were discussing in their assembly, on being told what it was, he said: âMonks, not only now, but formerly too, before the appearance of those endowed with virtue, such as were without virtue attained to the highest gain and glory, but when those who were endowed with virtue appeared, such as were devoid of it lost their gain and glory.â And with this he told a story of the past.

The Teacher, making the connection between the two stories, after Fully Awakening repeated these verses: 
{3.128}

1. âBefore the crested peacock had appeared,

Crows were with gifts of fruit and meat revered:


2. The sweet-voiced peacock to BÄveru came,

The crow at once was stripped of gifts and fame.


3. So man to divers monks due honour paid,

Till Buddha the full light of Truth displayed:


4. But when the sweet-voiced Buddha preached the law,

From heretics their gifts and praise all men withdraw.â

After uttering these four verses, he thus identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the Jain NÄthaputta was the crow, and I myself was the royal peacock.â

âOf old, Visayha.â
 
[3.85]
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana about AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika. The incident that gave rise to the story has already been told in full in the Khadiraá¹gÄrajÄtaka [Ja 40].

For AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika, who had lavished fifty-four crores on the dispensation of the Buddha over the monastery alone, and who valued naught else save only the Three Jewels, used to go every day while the Teacher was at Jetavana to attend the Great Services â once at daybreak, once after breakfast, and once in the evening. There were intermediate services too; but he never went empty-handed, for fear the novices and lads should look to see what he had brought with him. When he went in the early morning, he used to have rice-gruel taken up; after breakfast, ghee, butter, honey, molasses, and the like; and in the evening, he brought perfumes, garlands and cloths. So much did he expend day after day, that his expense knew no bounds. Moreover, many traders borrowed money from him on their bonds â to the amount of eighteen crores; and the great merchant never called the money in. Furthermore, another eighteen crores of the family property, which were buried in the riverbank, were washed out to sea, when the bank was swept away by a storm; and down rolled the brazen pots, with fastenings and seals unbroken, to the bottom of the ocean. In his house, too, there was always rice standing ready for 500 monks â so that the merchantâs house was to the Saá¹gha like a pool dug where four roads meet, yes, like mother and father was he to them. Therefore, even the Supreme Buddha used to go to his house, and the Eighty Chief Elders too; and the number of other monks passing in and out was beyond measure.


Now his house was seven stories high and had seven portals; and over the fourth gateway dwelt a DevatÄ who was a heretic. When the Supreme Buddha came into the house, she could not stay in her abode on high, but came down with her children to the ground-floor; and she had to do the same whenever the Eighty Chief Elders or the other elders came in and out. Thought she, âSo long as the ascetic Gotama and his disciples keep coming into this house I can have no peace here; I canât be eternally coming downstairs to the ground floor. I must contrive to stop them from coming any more to this house.â So one day, when the business manager had retired to rest, she appeared before him in visible shape.


âWho is that?â said he. âIt is I,â was the reply, âthe DevatÄ who lives over the fourth gateway.â âWhat brings you here?â âYou donât see what the merchant is doing. Heedless of his own future, he is drawing upon his resources, only to enrich the ascetic Gotama. He engages in no commerce; he undertakes no business. Advise the merchant to attend to his business, and arrange that the ascetic Gotama with his disciples shall come no more into the house.â


Then said he, âFoolish DevatÄ, if the merchant does spend his money, he spends it on the dispensation of the Buddha, which leads to safety. Even if he were to seize me by the hair and sell me for a slave, I will say nothing. Begone!â


Another day, she went to the merchantâs eldest son and gave him the same advice. And he flouted her in just the same manner. But to the merchant himself she did not so much as dare to speak on the matter.


Now by dint of unending munificence and of doing no business, the merchantâs incomings diminished and his estate grew less and less; so that he sank by degrees into poverty, and his table, his dress, and his bed and food were no longer what they had once been. Yet, in spite of his altered circumstances, be continued to entertain the Saá¹gha, though he was no longer able to feast them. So one day when he had made his bow and taken his seat, the Teacher said to him, âHouseholder, are gifts being given at your house?â âYes, sir,â said he, âbut thereâs only a little sour husk-porridge, left over from yesterday.â âBe not distressed, householder, at the thought that you can only offer what is unpalatable. If the heart be good, the food given to Buddhas, Paccekabuddhas, and their disciples, cannot but be good too. And why? Because of the greatness of the fruit thereof. For he who can make his heart acceptable cannot give an unacceptable gift â as is to be testified by the following passage:

âFor, if the heart have faith, no gift is small

To Buddhas or to their disciples true.


âTis said no service can be reckoned small

Thatâs paid to Buddhas, lords of great renown.


Mark well what fruit rewarded that poor gift

Of pottage â dried-up, sour, and lacking salt.â

Also, he said this further thing, âHouseholder, in giving this unpalatable gift, you are giving it to those who have entered on the Noble Eightfold Path. Whereas I, when in VelÄmaâs time I stirred up all JambudÄ«pa by giving the seven things of price, and in my largesse poured them forth as though I had made into one mighty stream the five great rivers â I yet found none who had reached the Three Refuges or kept the Five Precepts; for rare are those who are worthy of offerings. Therefore, let not your heart be troubled by the thought that your gift is unpalatable.â And so saying, he repeated the VelÄmakasutta [AN 9.20].


Now that DevatÄ who had not dared to speak to the merchant in the days of his magnificence, thought that now he was poor he would hearken to her, and so, entering his chamber at dead of night she appeared before him in visible shape, standing in mid-air. âWhoâs that?â said the merchant, when he became aware of her presence. âI am the DevatÄ, great merchant, who dwells over the fourth gateway.â âWhat brings you here?â âTo give you counsel.â âProceed, then.â âGreat merchant, you take no thought for your own future or for your own children. You have expended vast sums on the dispensation of the ascetic Gotama; in fact, by long-continued expenditure and by not undertaking new business you have been brought by the ascetic Gotama to poverty. But even in your poverty you do not shake off the ascetic Gotama! The ascetics are in and out of your house this very day just the same! What they have had of you cannot be recovered. That may be taken for certain. But henceforth donât you go yourself to the ascetic Gotama and donât let his disciples set foot inside your house. Do not even turn to look at the ascetic Gotama but attend to your trade and traffic in order to restore the family estate.â


Then he said to her, âWas this the counsel you wanted to give me?â âYes, it was.â


Said the merchant, âThe One with Ten Powers has made me proof against a hundred, a thousand, yes against a hundred thousand DevatÄs such as you are! My faith is strong and steadfast as Mount Sineru! My substance has been expended on the dispensation that leads to safety. Wicked are your words; it is a blow aimed at the dispensation of the Buddhas by you, you wicked and impudent wretch. I cannot live under the same roof with you; be off at once from my house and seek shelter elsewhere!â


Hearing these words of that converted man and elect disciple, she could not stay, but repairing to her dwelling, took her children by the hand and went forth. But though she went, she was minded, if she could not find herself a lodging elsewhere, to appease the merchant and return to dwell in his house; and in this mind she went to the tutelary deity of the city and with due salutation stood before him. Being asked what had brought her there, she said: âMy lord, I have been speaking imprudently to AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika, and he in his anger has turned me out of my home. Take me to him and make it up between us, so that he may let me live there again.â âBut what was it you said to the merchant?â âI told him for the future not to support the Buddha and the Saá¹gha, and not to let the ascetic Gotama set foot again in his house. This is what I said, my lord.â âWicked were your words; it was a blow aimed at the dispensation. I cannot take you with me to the merchant.â Meeting with no support from him, she went to the Four Great Kings of the world. And being repulsed by them in the same manner, she went on to Sakka, King of Devas, and told him her story, beseeching him still more earnestly, as follows, âDeva, finding no shelter, I wander about homeless, leading my children by the hand. Grant me of your majesty some place wherein to dwell.â


And he too said to her, âYou have done wickedly; it was a blow aimed at the Conquerorâs dispensation. I cannot speak to the merchant on your behalf. But I can tell you one way whereby the merchant may be led to pardon you.â âPray tell me, Deva.â âMen have had eighteen crores of the merchant on bonds. Take the semblance of his agent, and without telling anybody repair to their houses with the bonds, in the company of some young Yakkhas. Stand in the middle of their houses with the bond in one hand and a receipt in the other, and terrify them with your Yakkha power, saying, âHereâs your acknowledgment of the debt. Our merchant did not move in the matter while he was affluent; but now he is poor, and you must pay up the money you owe.â By your Yakkha power obtain all those eighteen crores of gold and fill the merchantâs empty treasuries. He had another treasure buried in the banks of the river AciravatÄ«, but when the bank was washed away, the treasure was swept into the sea. Get that back also by your supernatural power and store it in his treasuries. Further, there is another sum of eighteen crores lying unowned in such and such a place. Bring that too and pour the money into his empty treasuries. When you have atoned by the recovery of these fifty-four crores, ask the merchant to forgive you.â âVery good, Deva,â said she. And she set to work obediently, and did just as she had been bidden. When she had recovered all the money, she went into the merchantâs chamber at dead of night and appeared before him in visible shape standing in the air.


The merchant asking who was there, she replied, âIt is I, great merchant, the blind and foolish DevatÄ who lived over your fourth gateway. In the greatness of my infatuate folly I knew not the virtues of a Buddha, and so came to say what I said to you some days ago. Pardon me my fault! At the instance of Sakka, King of Devas, I have made atonement by recovering the eighteen crores owing to you, the eighteen crores which had been washed down into the sea, and another eighteen crores which were lying unowned in such and such a place â making fifty-four crores in all, which I have poured into your empty treasure-chambers. The sum you expended on the monastery at Jetavana is now made up again. While I have nowhere to dwell, I am in misery. Bear not in mind what I did in my ignorant folly, great merchant, but pardon me.â


AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika, hearing what she said, thought to himself, âShe is a DevatÄ, and she says she has atoned, and confesses her fault. The Teacher shall consider this and make his virtues known to her. I will take her before the Supreme Buddha.â So he said: âMy good DevatÄ, if you want me to pardon you, ask me in the presence of the master.â âVery good,â said she, âI will. Take me along with you to the Teacher.â âCertainly,â said he. And early in the morning, when night was just passing away, he took her with him to the Teacher, and told the TathÄgata all that she had done.


Hearing this, the Teacher said: âYou see, householder, how the defiled man regards defilement as excellent before it ripens to its fruit. But when it has ripened, then he sees defilements to be defiled. Likewise the good man looks on his goodness as wrong before it ripens to its fruit; but when it ripens, he sees it to be goodness.â And so saying, he repeated these two verses from the Dhammapada [119-120]:

âThe defiled man thinks his deed is good,

So long as wrong has ripened not to fruit.

But when his wrong at last to ripeness grows,

The defiled man sees âIt was wrong I wrought.â


The good man thinks his goodness is but wrong,

So long as it has ripened not to fruit.

But when his goodness unto ripeness grows,

The good man sees that âIt was good I wrought.â â

At the close of these verses that DevatÄ was established in the Fruit of the First Path. She fell at the wheel-marked feet of the Teacher, crying, âStained as I was with passion, depraved by defilements, misled by delusion, and blinded by ignorance, I spoke wickedly because I knew not your virtues. Pardon me!â Then she received pardon from the Teacher and from the great merchant.


At this time AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika sang his own praises in the Teacherâs presence, saying: âSir, though this DevatÄ did her best to stop me from giving support to the Buddha and his following, she could not succeed; and though she tried to stop me from giving gifts, yet I gave them still! Was not this goodness on my part?â

On this occasion the Teacher addressing AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika said: âWise men of old, my lay brother, gave alms, rejecting the counsel of Sakka, king of heaven, when he stood in mid-air and tried to prevent them, saying, âGive not alms.â â 
[As can be seen from the story above in Ja 40 
Khadiraá¹gÄrajÄtaka
, it is a DevatÄ who advises against giving alms, and not Sakka. In the 
JÄtakamÄlÄ
 version of the story, however, it is Åakra who makes the request, as stated here.]
 And at his request the Teacher told a story of the past.

1. âOf old, Visayha, you did alms bestow

And to almsgiving loss of wealth do owe.

Henceforth show self-restraint, refuse to give,

And you midst lasting joys for aye shall live.â 
{3.131}

2. âIt is not right, men say, that deed of shame

Should stain the honour of a noble name.

O you that do a thousand eyes possess

Guard us from this, eâen in our sore distress.


3. Let not our wealth in faithless wise be spent

On our own pleasure or aggrandisement,

But as of old our stores with increase bless.


4. By that same road a former chariot went

A second may well go. So will we give

As long as we have wherewithal to live,

Nor at the worst each generous thought repress.â 
[3.87] {3.132}

The Teacher, having ended his lesson, thus identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the mother of RÄhula was the merchantâs wife, and I myself was Visayha.â

 This story was told by the Teacher at Jetavana, concerning a heron that lived in the house of the king of Kosala. She carried messages, they say, for the king, and had two young ones. The king sent this bird with a letter to some other king. When she was gone away, the boys in the royal family squeezed the young birds to death with their hands. The mother bird came back and missing her young ones, asked who had killed her offspring. They said: âSo and so.â And at this time there was a fierce and savage tiger kept in the palace, fastened by a strong chain. Now these boys came to see the tiger and the heron went with them, thinking: âEven as my young ones were killed by them, just so will I deal with these boys,â and she took hold of them and threw them down at the foot of the tiger. The tiger with a growl crunched them up. The bird said: âNow is the wish of my heart fulfilled,â and flying up into the air made straight for the HimÄlayas.


On hearing what had happened they started a discussion in the Dhamma Hall, saying, 
{3.135}
 âSirs, a heron, it is said, in the kingâs palace threw down before a tiger the boys who killed her young ones, and when she had thus brought about their death, she made off.â The Teacher came and inquired what it was the monks were discussing and said: âNot only now, monks, but formerly also did she bring about the death of those who killed her young ones.â And herewith he related a legend of the past.

1. âLong I held this house as mine,

Honour great I did receive,

It is due to act of thine

I am now compelled to leave.â

2. âShould one to retaliate,

Wrong with equal wrong repay,

Then his anger should abate;

So, good heron, pray you stay.â

Nought, O king, can keep me here,

Lo! From henceforth I am gone.â

4. âShould they wise, not foolish be,

With the wronged wrong-doer may

Live in peace and harmony:

So, good heron, pray you, stay.â

âShe that did your mangoes eat.â
 
{3.137}
 This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, concerning an elder who kept watch over mango fruit. When he was old, they say, he became an ascetic and built himself a hut of leaves in a mango orchard on the outskirts of Jetavana, and not only himself continually ate the ripe fruit that fell from the mango trees, but also gave some to his kinsfolk. When he had set out on his round of alms-begging, some thieves knocked down his mangoes, and ate some and went off with others. At this moment the four daughters of a rich merchant, after bathing in the river AciravatÄ«, in wandering about strayed into the mango orchard. When the old man returned and found them there, he charged them with having eaten his mangoes.


âSir,â they said, âwe have but just come; we have not eaten your mangoes.â


âThen take an oath,â he said.


âWe will, sir,â they said, and took an oath. The old man having thus put them to shame, by making them take an oath, let them go.


The monks, hearing of his action, raised a discussion in the Dhamma Hall, how that an old man exacted an oath from the daughters of a merchant, who entered the mango orchard where he himself lived, and after putting them to shame by administering an oath to them, let them go. When the Teacher came and on inquiring what was the topic they sat in council to discuss, heard what it was, he said: âNot only now, monks, but formerly also this old man, when he kept watch over mangoes, made certain daughters of a rich merchant take an oath, and after thus putting them to shame let them go.â And so saying he told a story of the past.
 [3.91]

1. âShe that did your mangoes eat,

As her lord shall own some churl,

That with dye grey hairs would cheat

And his locks with tongs would curl.â

2. âLet the maid that robbed your tree

Vainly for a husband sigh,

Past her teens though she may be

And on thirty verging nigh.â

3. âShe that your ripe mangoes ate

Weary path shall tread alone,

And at trysting place too late

Grieve to find her lover gone.â 
[3.92]

4. âShe that did your tree despoil

Gaily dressed, with wreath on head,

And bedewed with sandal oil

Still shall seek a virgin bed.â

The Teacher, having ended his lesson, identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time this false ascetic was the old man who watched mangoes. The four merchantâs daughters played the same part then as now. But Sakka was myself.â

 This story was told by the Teacher at Jetavana, concerning a slothful monk. He was, it was said, of gentle birth and lived at SÄvatthi. And after giving his heart to the dispensation and taking ordination, he became slothful, and as regards questioning, enquiring, devotion and the round of monastic duties, he did not fully enter into them, being overcome by his hindrances, and was always to be found at public lounging-places.


The monks discussed his sloth in the Dhamma Hall, saying: âSuch a one, sirs, after taking ordination in so excellent a dispensation that leads to safety, is continually slothful and indolent, and overcome by his hindrances.â 
{3.140}
 When the Teacher came and inquired what the monks were assembled to discuss, on being told what it was, he said: âNot only now, monks, but formerly too was he slothful.â And so saying he told a story of the past.

1. âShould a flame sweep through the grove,

Leaving blackened path behind,

How, sir waddler, slow to move,

Here a refuge will be found

Or an end of us âtwill be.â

And tarries long when utmost speed is best,

Fulfil their purpose, as her orb the moon.â

âYou that of late.â
 This story the Teacher while at Jetavana told concerning the meal of the faithful.


In the house of AnÄthapiá¹dika, they say, five hundred monks were constantly fed. 
{3.142}
 The house was continually like a place of refreshment for the assembly of the monks, bright with the sheen of their yellow robes and blown upon with saintly odours. So one day the king in making a solemn procession 
[3.94]
 round the city caught sight of the assembly of the monks in the Treasurerâs house, and thinking: âI too will grant a perpetual alms to the assembly of saints,â he went to the monastery and after greeting the Teacher he instituted perpetual alms for five hundred monks. Thenceforth there was a perpetual giving of alms in the kingâs house, even choice food of rice with the perfume of the rain upon it, but there are none to give it with their own hands, with marks of affection and faith, but the kingâs ministers dispense the food, and the monks do not care to sit down and eat it, but taking the various dainty foods, they go each to the house of his own retainers, and giving them the food, themselves eat whatever is set before them, whether coarse or dainty.


Now one day much wild fruit was brought to the king. The king said: âGive it to the Saá¹gha of monks.â They went to the refectory and came and told the king, âThere is not a single monk there.â


âWhat, is it not time yet?â said the king. âYes it is time,â they said, âbut the monks take the food in your house, and then go to the abode of their trusty servitors, and give the food to them, and themselves eat whatsoever is served up to them, whether it be coarse or dainty.â


The king said: âOur food is dainty. Why in the world do they abstain from ours and eat some other food?â And thinking: âI will inquire of the Teacher,â he went to the monastery and asked him.


The Teacher said: âThe best food is that which is given in faith. Owing to the absence of those who by giving in faith establish friendly feeling, the monks take the food and eat it in some friendly place of their own. There is no flavour, sire, equal to that of faith. That which is given without faith, though it be composed of the four sweet things, is not worth so much as wild rice given with faith. Wise men of old, when sickness arose amongst them, though the king with his five families of leeches provided remedies, if the sickness were not thus assuaged, repaired to their intimate friends and by eating broth of wild rice and millet, without salt, or even leaves without salt, sprinkled with water only, were healed of their sickness.â And with these words at their request he told them a story.

1. âYou that of late with lord of men did dwell,

A king prepared to grant your heartâs desire,

What is the charm of Kappaâs ascetic cell

That blessed Kesava should here retire?â

2. âAll here is charming: eâen the very trees

O NÄrada, my fancy take,

And Kappaâs words that never fail to please

A grateful echo in my heart awake.â

3. âYou that but now the purest rice did eat

Boiled with a dainty flavouring of meat,

How can you relish such insipid fare

And millet and wild rice with ascetics share?â 
[3.96] {3.145}

4. âThe food may coarse or dainty prove,

May scanty be or much abound,

Yet if the meal is blessed with faith,

Love the best sauce by far is found.â

The Teacher, having ended his lesson, identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the king was Änanda, NÄrada was SÄriputta, Kesava was Bakabrahma, 
See Ja 405. [This is a little odd, as Bakabrahma plays no part in the introductory story.]

 This story the Teacher, while dwelling at Jetavana, told concerning the duty of doing good to men. The incident that led to the story will be set forth in the MahÄkaá¹hajÄtaka [Ja 469].

One day, they say, the monks as they sat in the Dhamma Hall, were talking together. âSirs,â one would say, âthe Teacher, ever practising friendship towards the multitudes of the people, has forsaken an agreeable abode, and lives just for the good of the world. He has attained supreme wisdom, yet of his own accord takes bowl and robe, and goes on a journey of eighteen leagues or more. For the five elders he set rolling the Wheel of the Dhamma; on the fifth day of the half-month he recited the Anattalakkhaá¹a discourse, and made them Arahats; he went to Uruveá¸·a, and to the ascetics with matted hair he showed three and a half thousand miracles, and persuaded them to join the Saá¹gha; at GayÄsÄ«sa he taught the Discourse upon Fire, and made a thousand of these ascetics Arahats; to MahÄkassapa, when he had gone forward three miles to meet him, after three discourses he gave the higher ordination; all alone, after the noon-day meal, he went a journey of forty-five leagues, and then established in the Fruit of the Third Path Pukkusa (a youth of very good birth); to meet MahÄkappina he went forward a space of two thousand leagues, and made him an Arahat; alone, in the afternoon he went a journey of thirty leagues, and made that cruel and harsh man Aá¹gulimÄla an Arahat; thirty leagues also he traversed, and established Äá¸·avaka in the Fruit of the First Path, and saved the prince; in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three he dwelt three months, and taught Abhidhamma to eight hundred millions of deities; to the Brahma Realm he went, and destroyed the false Dhamma of Baka Brahma, and made ten thousand Brahmas Arahats; every year he goes on pilgrimage in three districts, and to such men as are capable of receiving, he gives the refuges, the precepts, and the Fruits of the different stages; he even acts for the good of NÄgas and Garuá¸·as and the like, in many ways.â


In such words they praised the goodness and worth of the One with Ten Powersâ life for the good of the world. The Teacher came in, and asked what they talked about as they sat there? They told him. âAnd no wonder, monks,â said he. âI who now in my perfect wisdom would live for the worldâs good, even I in the past, in the days of passion, lived for the good of the world.â So saying, he told a story of the past.

1. âWhy in mid air, O Yakkha, do you stand

With that huge bolt of iron in your hand?

Are you to guard me from all harm intent,

Or here today for my destruction sent?â

2. âAs messenger of Rakkhasas, lo! here

To compass your destruction I appear,

But all in vain the fiery bolt I wield

Against the head that Sakkaâs self would shield.â

3. âIf Sakka, SujÄâs lord, in heaven that reigns,

Great king of gods, my cause to champion deigns, 
{3.147}

With hideous howl PisÄcas rend the sky,

No Rakkhasas have power to terrify.


4. Let mud PisÄcas gibber as they may,

They are not equal to so stern a fray.â

The Teacher here ended his lesson and identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time Anuruddha was Sakka, and I myself was the king of Benares.â

âThis doubt, my father.â
 
[3.98]
 This story the Teacher told when dwelling at Jetavana, concerning the seduction of a youth by a certain sensual girl. The incident that led up to the story will be set forth in the CullanÄradakassapajÄtaka [Ja 477].

This story the Teacher told, while dwelling at Jetavana, about the allurements of a sensual girl.


There was then, we learn, a girl of about sixteen, daughter of a citizen of SÄvatthi, such as might bring good luck to a man, yet no man chose her. So her mother thought to herself, âThis my daughter is of full age, yet no one chooses her. I will use her as bait for a fish, and make one of those SÄkiyan ascetics come back to the world, and live upon him.â


At the time there was a young man of good birth living in SÄvatthi, who had given his heart to the dispensation and went forth. But from the time when he had received full ordination he had lost all desire for learning, and lived devoted to the adornment of his person.


The lay sister used to prepare in her house rice gruel, and other food hard or soft, and standing at the door, as the monks walked along the streets, looked out for someone who could be tempted by the craving for delicacies. Streaming by went a crowd of monks who upheld the Three Baskets, including the Abhidhamma and the Vinaya; but among them she saw none ready to rise to her bait. Among the figures with bowl and robe, preachers of the Dhamma with honey-sweet voice, moving like fleecy scud before the wind, she saw not one.


But at last she perceived a man approaching, the outer corners of his eyes anointed, hair hanging down, wearing an under-robe of fine cloth, and an outer robe shaken and cleansed, bearing a bowl coloured like some precious gem, and a sunshade after his own heart, a man who let his senses have their own way, his body much bronzed. âHere is a man I can catch!â thought she; and greeting him, she took his bowl, and invited him into the house. She found him a seat, and provided rice gruel and all the rest; then after the meal, begged him to make that house his resort in future. So he used to visit the house after that, and in course of time became intimate.


One day, the lay sister said in his hearing, âIn this household we are happy enough, only I have no son or son-in-law capable of keeping it up.â The man heard it, and wondering what reason she could have for so saying, in a little while he was as it were pierced to the heart. She said to her daughter, âTempt this man, and get him into your power.â So the girl after that time decked herself and adorned herself, and tempted him with all womenâs tricks and wiles. Then the man, being young and under the power of passion, thought in his heart, âI cannot now hold on to the Buddhaâs dispensation,â and he went to the monastery, and laying down bowl and robe, said to his spiritual teachers, âI am discontented.â


Then they conducted him to the Teacher, and said: âSir, this monk is discontented.â âIs this true which they say,â asked he, âthat you are discontented, monk?â âYes, sir, true it is.â âThen what made you so?â âA sensual girl, sir.â âMonk,â said he, âlong, long ago, when you were living in the forest, this same girl was a hindrance to your holiness, and did you great harm; then why are you again discontented on her account?â Then at the request of the monks he told a story of the past.

1. âThis doubt, my father, solve for me, I pray;

If to some village from this wood I stray,

Men of what school of morals, or what sect

Shall I most wisely for my friends affect?â

2. âOne that can gain your confidence and love,

Can trust your word, and with you patient prove,


3. In thought and word and deed will neâer offend â

Take to your heart and cling to him as friend.


4. To men capricious as the monkey-kind

And found unstable, be not you inclined,

Though to some desert you should be confined.â 
{3.149}

The Teacher, his lesson ended, thus identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the youth and the maiden were the same as in the later story. The ascetic was myself.â

 collect slanderous tales, called them to him and asked, âIs it true, monks, that you collect slanderous tales of such of your monks as are inclined to quarrelling and strife and debate, and that quarrels therefore, that would not otherwise arise, spring up and when they so arise have a tendency to grow?â âIt is true,â they said. Then he reproved those monks and said: âMonks, backbiting speech is like a blow with a sharp sword. A firm friendship is quickly broken up by slander and people that listen thereto become liable to be estranged from their friends, as was the case with the lion and the bull.â And so saying he told a story of the past.

1. âNought in common had this pair,

Neither wives nor food did share;


2. Yet behold how slanderous word,

Keen as any two-edged sword,

Did devise with cunning art

Friends of old to keep apart.

Thus did bull and lion fall

Prey to meanest beast of all:


3. So will all bed-fellows be

With this pair in misery,

If they lend a willing ear

To the slandererâs whispered sneer.


4. But they thrive exceeding well,

Eâen as those in heaven that dwell,

Who to slander neâer attend â

Slander parting friend from friend.â

âStripped of all the joys of life.â
 
[3.102] {3.153}
 This story the Teacher, while dwelling at Jetavana, told concerning a councillor who was guilty of misconduct in the harem of the king of Kosala. The incident that gave rise to the story has been given in full before. 
[I include the story here.]

This tale the Teacher told at Jetavana, about a courtier of the king of Kosala. This man was very useful to the king, we are told, and did everything that had to be done. Because he was very useful, the king did him great honour. The others were jealous, and concocted a slander, and calumniated him. The king believed their saying, and without enquiring into his guilt, bound him in chains, though virtuous and innocent, and cast him into prison. There he dwelt all alone; but, by reason of his virtue, he had peace of mind, and with mind at peace he understood the conditions of existence, and attained the fruition of the First Path. By and by the king found that he was guiltless, and broke his chains and gave him honour more than before.


The man wished to pay his respects to the Teacher; and taking flowers and perfumes, he went to the monastery, and did reverence to the TathÄgata, and sat respectfully aside. The Teacher talked graciously with him. âWe have heard that ill fortune befell you,â said he. âYes, sir, but I made my ill fortune into good; and as I sat in prison, I produced the fruition of the First Path.â

1. âStripped of all the joys of life,

Jewelled earrings, horse and car,

Robbed of child and loving wife,

Nought your pleasure seems to mar.â 
{3.154}

2. âPleasures soon make haste to leave us,

Pleasures soon must all forego,

Sorrow has no power to grieve us,

Joy itself soon turns to woe.


3. Moons with new-born orb appearing

Wax awhile, to wane and die,

Suns with warmth all nature cheering,

Haste to set in yonder sky.

Change is this worldâs law I see,

Sorrow has no pangs for me.â 
[3.103]

4. âThe idle sensual layman I detest,

The false ascetic is a rogue confessed.

A bad king will a case unheard decide;

Wrath in the sage can neâer be justified.


5. The warrior prince a well-weighed verdict gives,

Of righteous judge the fame for ever lives.â 
{3.155}

The Teacher, having ended his discourse, thus identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time Änanda was the king of Kosala, and I myself was the king of Benares.â

âWhy haste to bring.â
 This story the Teacher, while dwelling at Jetavana, told concerning a landowner who had lost his father. On the death of his father, they say, he went about lamenting, quite unable to shake off his grief. The Teacher perceived in the man a capacity to attain to the fruit of emancipation, and when he went his rounds in SÄvatthi for alms, accompanied by an attendant monk, he came to his house and sitting down on the seat prepared for him he bowed to his host, who was also seated, and said: âLay brother, are you grieving?â and on his replying, âYes, venerable sir, I am,â he said: âFriend, sages of old hearkened to the words of wisdom, and when they lost a father, they did not grieve.â And at the request of his host he told a story of the past.

1. âWhy haste to bring your new-mown grass so sweet,

And cry to lifeless beast, âArise and eatâ?


2. No food may raise to life an ox thatâs dead,

Your words are idle and of folly bred.â

3. âI think this beast may come to life again,

Both head and tail and its four feet remain.


4. But of my grandfather head and limbs are gone:

No fool weeps oâer his grave, but you alone.â 
{3.157}

5. âAs ghee-fed flame that blazes out amain

Is quenched with water, so he quenched my pain.

6. With sorrowâs shaft my heart was wounded sore,

He healed the wound and did my life restore.


7. The barb extracted, full of peace and joy,

I cease to grieve and hearken to my boy.


8. Thus kindly souls wean mortals from their grief,

As wise SujÄta brought his sire relief.â

The Teacher having ended his discourse revealed the Truths and identified the JÄtaka. At the conclusion of the Truths the landowner attained fruition of the First Path. âAt that time I myself was SujÄta.â

âThough you are now.â
 
[3.105]
 This story the Teacher, while living in the BhesakalÄ grove near Suá¹sumÄragiri (Mount Crocodile) in the country of the Bhaggas, told concerning young prince Bodhi. This prince was the son of Udena, and at this time dwelt in Suá¹sumÄragiri. Now he summoned a very skilful artisan, and got him to build him a palace called Kokanada, and to make it unlike that of any other king. 
{3.158}
 And afterwards he thought: âThis artisan may build a similar palace for some other king.â And from a feeling of envy he plucked out his eyes.


This circumstance became known in the assembly of the monks. Then they raised a discussion in the Dhamma Hall, saying: âSirs, young prince Bodhi had the eyes of such and such an artisan put out. Surely he is a harsh, cruel, and violent man.â The Teacher came and asked what was the topic the monks were debating as they sat together, and hearing what it was he said: âNot only now, but formerly too such was his nature, and of old in like manner he put out the eyes of a thousand warriors and, after slaying them, he offered up their flesh as a sacrifice.â And so saying he told them a story of the past.

1. âThough you are now with peace and plenty blessed,

Such happy fate may short-lived prove to be:

Should riches perish, be not sore distressed,

Like storm-tossed sailor wrecked far out at sea.


2. Each one shall fare according to his deed,

And reap the harvest as he sows the seed,

Whether of goodly herb, or maybe noxious weed.â 
{3.159}

3. âAh! Now at last I recognize the truth

The teacher taught me in my heedless youth:

Wrong not, he cried, or else the evil deed

To thine own punishment may one day lead. 
[3.107]


4. Beneath this treeâs extended boughs and shade

Libation due of sandal oil was made.

âTwas here I slew a thousand kings, and lo!

The pangs they suffered then, I now must undergo.â 
{3.161}

5. âO UbbarÄ«, my queen of swarthy hue,

Lithe as a shoot of fair moringa tree,

That do your limbs with sandal oil bedew,

How should I live, bereft of sight of you?

Yea death itself than this less grievous far would be!â

The Teacher, having ended his lesson, thus identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the young prince Bodhi was the marauding king, Devadatta was Piá¹giya, and I myself was the world-famed teacher.â

{3.162}
 This story the Teacher, while dwelling at Jetavana, told concerning a landowner whose son had died. The introductory story is just the same as that of the man who lost both his wife and father. Here too the Teacher in the same way went to the manâs house, and after saluting him as he was seated, asked him saying: âPray, sir, are you grieving?â And on his replying, âYes, venerable sir, ever since my sonâs death I grieve,â he said: âSir, verily that which is subject to dissolution is dissolved, and that which is subject to destruction is destroyed, 
Compare the story of Epictetus as given by Bacon, 
Advancement of Learning,
 i. 8. The philosopher one day saw a woman weeping for a broken pitcher, and next day saw another woman weeping over her dead son. Whereupon he said, â
Yesterday I saw a fragile pitcher break, today I saw a mortal die
.â [Given in Latin in the original: 
Heri vidi fragilem frangi, hodie vidi mortalem mori.
]
 and this happens not to one man only, nor in one village merely, but in countless spheres, and in the Three Worlds, there is no creature that is not subject to death, nor is there any existing thing that is capable of abiding in the same condition. All beings are subject to 
[3.108]
 death, and all compounds are subject to dissolution. But sages of old, when they lost a son, said, âThat which is subject to destruction is destroyed,â and grieved not.â And hereupon at the manâs request he related a story of the past.

1. âMan quits his mortal frame, when joy in life is past,

Eâen as a snake is wont its worn out slough to cast.


2. No friendâs lament can touch the ashes of the dead:

Why should I grieve? He fares the way he had to tread.â 
{3.165}

3. âUncalled he hither came, unbidden soon to go;

Eâen as he came, he went. What cause is here for woe?


4. No friendâs lament can touch the ashes of the dead:

Why should I grieve? He fares the way he had to tread.â

5. âThough I should fast and weep, how would it profit me?

My kith and kin, alas, would more unhappy be. 
{3.166}


6. No friendâs lament can touch the ashes of the dead:

Why should I grieve? He fares the way he had to tread.â

7. âAs children cry in vain to grasp the moon above,

So mortals idly mourn the loss of those they love.


8. No friendâs lament can touch the ashes of the dead:

Why should I grieve? He fares the way he had to tread.â 
{3.167}

9. âA broken pot of earth, ah! who can piece again?

So too to mourn the dead is nought but labour vain.


10. No friendâs lament can touch the ashes of the dead:

Why should I grieve? He fares the way he had to tread.â 
[3.111]

The Teacher having finished his exposition of the Dhamma, declared the Truths and identified the JÄtaka. At the conclusion of the Truths the landowner attained the fruit of the First Path. âAt that time KhujjuttarÄ was the female slave, Uppalavaá¹á¹Ä the daughter, RÄhula the son, KhemÄ the mother, and I myself was the brahmin.â

 This story the Teacher, dwelling at Jetavana, told concerning a minister of the king of Kosala. The introductory story is identical with one already given.


But in this case the king after bestowing great honour on a minister who served him well, gave ear to certain mischief-makers and had him seized and thrown into prison. While he was lying there, he entered upon the First Path. The king, becoming aware of his great merit, released him. He took a scented garland and coming into the presence of the Teacher, saluted him and sat down. Then the Teacher asked if some evil had not befallen him. âYes, venerable sir,â he answered, âbut through evil good has come to me. I have entered on the First Path.â âVerily,â said the Teacher, ânot you only, but sages of old got good out of evil.â And herewith at his request he told a story of the past.

1. âWhile others weep and wail, their cheeks with tears bestained,

Why still with smiling face, has Ghata neâer complained?â

2. âTo change the past all sorrow is but vain,

It has no blessing for a future state:

Why should I, Vaá¹ka, of my woes complain?

Grief is no helpmate fit with us to mate.


3. One that is sick with sorrow pines away,

His food insipid and distasteful grows,

Pierced as with arrows, to his grief a prey,

He sinks a laughing-stock to all his foes.


4. Whether my home be on dry land or sea,

Be it in village, or some forest drear,

No sorrow ever shall come nigh to me,

A soul converted can have nought to fear.


5. But he that lacks completion in himself

And is with lust of things of sense fire,

Not the whole world, with all its sordid pelf,

Can eâer suffice for such a manâs desire.â

âWhy in forest.â
 
[3.113]
 This was a story told by the Teacher while dwelling at Jetavana, concerning the Captain of the Dhamma (SÄriputta). That elder, they say, when wicked folk came to him, such as hunters, fishermen and the like, laid down the moral law to them, and any others that he might see from time to time, saying: âReceive you the precepts.â Through respect for the elder, they could not disobey his words and accepted the precepts, but failed to keep it, and still followed each after his own business. The elder took counsel with his fellow monastics and said: âSirs, these men receive the precepts from me, but keep it not.â 
{3.171}
 They answered, âVenerable sir, you preach the precepts to them against their wishes, and as they dare not disobey what you tell them, they accept it. Henceforth lay not down the precepts to such as these.â The elder was offended.


On hearing of the incident they started a discussion in the Dhamma Hall, how that the elder SÄriputta preached the precepts to any that he happened to see. The Teacher came and inquired what was the topic that the monks were debating in their assembly, and on hearing what it was, he said: âNot only now, monks, but formerly also he preached the precepts to any men he might chance to see, even though they did not ask for it.â And herewith he told a story of the past.

1. âWhy in forest all alone

Seizing oft a mighty stone,

Did you hurl it with a will,

Mountain cave as âtwere to fill?â

2. âI would make this sea-girt land

Smooth as palm of human hand:

Thus I level knoll and hill

And with stones each hollow fill.â

3. âNeâer a one of mortal birth

Has the power to level earth.

Scarce KÄraá¹á¸iya can hope

With a single cave to cope.â 
{3.173}

4. âIf a man of mortal birth

Has no power to level earth,

Heretics may well refuse,

Brahmin, to adopt your views.â

5. âFriend KÄraá¹á¸iya, in short

For my good you do exhort:

Earth can never levelled be,

Neither can all men agree.â

The Teacher, having ended this lesson, identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time SÄriputta was the brahmin, and I myself was the disciple KÄraá¹á¸iya.â

He has not an atom of pity for mortals.â When the Teacher came, he inquired what was the topic the monks were assembled to discuss, and on hearing what it was, he said: âMonks, not only now, but formerly also he was pitiless.â And herewith he told a story of the past.

1. âElephant of sixty years,

Forest lord amongst your peers,

I am but a puny bird,

You a leader of the herd;

With my wings I homage pay,

Spare my little ones, I pray.â 
{3.175}

2. âRoaming over hill and dale

Cherishing your lonely way,

You, O forest king, I hail,

And with wings my homage pay.

I am but a wretched quail,

Spare my tender brood to slay.â

3. âI will slay your young ones, quail;

What can your poor help avail?

My left foot can crush with ease

Many thousand birds like these.â 
{3.176}

4. âPower abused is not all gain,

Power is often follyâs bane.

Beast that did my young ones kill,

I will work you mischief still.â

5. âA quail with crow, blue fly and frog allied

Once proved the issue of a deadly feud.

Through them king elephant untimely died:

Therefore all quarrelling should be eschewed.â

He identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time Devadatta was the rogue elephant, and I myself was the leader of the herd of elephants.â

âMahÄpatÄpaâs wretched queen.â
 This story the Teacher, when dwelling in the Bamboo Grove, told concerning the going about of Devadatta to slay the Bodhisatta. In all other births Devadatta failed to excite so much as an atom of fear in the Bodhisatta, 
{3.178}
 but in the CulladhammapÄlajÄtaka [Ja 358], when the Bodhisatta was only seven months old, he had his hands and feet and head cut off and his body encircled with sword cuts, as it were with a garland. In the DaddarajÄtaka [Ja 438] 
[This is an alternative name for Ja 438 
TittirajÄtaka
.]
 he killed him by twisting his neck, and roasted his flesh in an oven and ate it. In the KhantivÄdijÄtaka [Ja 313] he had him scourged with two thousand strokes of a whip, and ordered his hands and feet and ears and nose to be cut off, and then had him seized by the hair of his head and dragged along, and when he was stretched at full length on his back, he kicked him in the belly and made off, and that very day the Bodhisatta died. But both in the CullanandakajÄtaka [Ja 222] and the Vevaá¹­iyakapijÄtaka [Ja 516] 
[See Ja 222 
CullanandiyajÄtaka
, and Ja 516 
MahÄkapijÄtaka
.] 
 he merely had him put to death. Thus did Devadatta for a long time go about trying to slay him, and continued to do so, even after he became a Buddha.


So one day they raised a discussion in the Hall of 
[3.118]
 Dhamma, saying: âSirs, Devadatta is continually forming plots to slay the Buddhas. Being minded to kill the Supreme Buddha, he instigated archers to shoot him, he threw down a rock upon him, and let loose the elephant NÄlÄgiri on him.â When the Teacher came and inquired what subject the monks were assembled to discuss, on hearing what it was he said: âMonks, not only now, but formerly too he went about to kill me, but now he fails to excite a particle of fear in me, though formerly when I was prince DhammapÄla he brought about my death, though I was his own son, by encircling my body with sword cuts, as it were with a garland.â And so saying, he related a story of the past.

1. âMahÄpatÄpaâs wretched queen,

âTis I alone to blame have been.

Bid DhammapÄla, sire, go free,

And off with hands of luckless me.â 
[3.119]

2. âMahÄpatÄpaâs wretched queen,

âTis I alone to blame have been.

Bid DhammapÄla, sire, go free,

And off with feet of luckless me.â

3. âMahÄpatÄpaâs wretched queen,

âTis I alone to blame have been.

Bid DhammapÄla, sire, go free,

And off with head of luckless me.â

4. âNo friendly councillors advise the king,

Slay not the heir that from your loins did spring:


5. No loving kinsmen urge the tender plea,

Slay not the boy that owes his life to thee.â

6. âYou, DhammapÄla, were by right of birth

The lord of earth:

Your arms, once bathed in oil of sandalwood,

Lie steeped in blood.

My fitful breath, alas, is choked with sighs

And broken cries.â

The Teacher, having brought this discourse to an end, identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time Devadatta was the king, MahÄpajÄpatÄ« was CandÄ, and I myself was prince DhammapÄla.â

## Full Story
âO golden foot.â
 This was a story told by the Teacher while in residence at Jetavana, about a maiden of gentle birth in SÄvatthi. She was, they say, the daughter in the household of a servitor of the two chief disciples at SÄvatthi, and was a faithful believer, fondly attached to Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saá¹gha, abounding in good works, wise, and devoted to generosity and such like deeds of piety. Another family in SÄvatthi of equal rank but of heretical views chose her in marriage. Then her parents said: âOur daughter is a faithful believer, devoted to the Three Jewels, given to alms and other good works, but you hold heretical views. And as you will not allow her to give alms, or to hear the Dhamma, or to visit the monastery, or to keep the moral law, or to observe the fast days, as she pleases, we will not give her to you in marriage. Choose you a maiden from a family of heretical views like yourselves.â When their offer was rejected, they said: âWhen she comes to our house let your daughter do everything of this kind, as she pleases. We will not prevent her. Only grant us this boon.â âTake her then,â they answered. So they celebrated the marriage 
[3.121]
 festivity at an auspicious season and led her home. She proved faithful in the discharge of her duties, and a devoted wife, and rendered due service to her father-in-law and mother-in-law.


One day she said to her husband, âI wish, my lord, to give alms to our family monastics.â âVery well, my dear, give them just what you please.â So one day she invited these monastics, and making a great entertainment, she fed them with choice food, and taking a seat apart from them she said: âVenerable sirs, this family is heretical and unbelieving. They are ignorant of the value of the Three Jewels. Well then, sirs, until this family understands the value of the Three Jewels, do you continue to receive your food here.â The monastics assented and continually ate their meals there. Again she addressed her husband, 
{3.183}
 âSir, the monastics constantly come here. Why do you not see them?â On hearing this he said: âVery well, I will see them.â


On the morrow she told him when the monastics had finished their meal. He came and sat respectfully on one side, conversing affably with the monastics. Then the Captain of the Dhamma preached the Dhamma to him. He was so charmed with the exposition of the faith, and the behaviour of the monastics, that from that day forward he prepared mats for the elders to sit on, and strained water for them, and after the meal listened to the exposition of the faith. By and by his heretical views gave way.


So one day the elder in expounding the faith declared the Truths to the man and his wife, and when the sermon was ended, they were both established in the fruition of the First Path. Thenceforth all of them, from his parents down to the hired servants, gave up their heretical views, and became devoted to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saá¹gha.


So one day this young girl said to her husband, âWhat, sir, have I to do with the household life? I wish to adopt the ascetic life.â âVery well, my dear,â he said: âI too will become an ascetic.â And he conducted her with great pomp to a nunnery, and had her admitted as a novice, and himself too went to the Teacher and begged to be ordained. The Teacher admitted him first as a novice and afterwards to full monastic orders. They both received clear spiritual vision, and shortly became an Arahat.


One day they raised a discussion in the Dhamma Hall, saying: âSirs, a certain woman by reason of her own faith and that of her husband became a novice. And both of them having adopted the ascetic life, and gained clear spiritual vision, became Arahats.â The Teacher, when he came, inquired what was the topic the monks were sitting in council to discuss, and on hearing what it was, he said: âMonks, not only now, did she set her husband free from the bonds of passion. Formerly too she freed even sages of old from the bonds of death.â And with these words he held his peace, but being pressed by them he related a story of the past.

1. âO golden foot, no effort spare

To loose thyself from thongÃ©d snare.

How could I joy, bereft of you,

To range amidst the woodland free?â 
{3.185}

2. âI spare no effort, but in vain,

My liberty I cannot gain.

The more I struggle to get loose,

The sharper bites the thongÃ©d noose.â

3. âLet on the earth a leafy bed,

Hunter, where we may fall, be spread:

And drawing from its sheath your sword,

Slay me and afterwards my lord.â

4. âA beast that speaks with voice of men,

Neâer came before within my ken.

Rest you in peace, my gentle deer,

And cease, O golden foot, to fear.â 
[3.123]

5. âAs I today rejoice to see

This mighty beast at liberty,

So, hunter, that did loose the trap,

Rejoice with all your kith and kin.â

The Teacher here ended his lesson and identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time Channa 
A monk who was suspended for siding with heretics. [I am not sure this gives an accurate picture of this complex personality: he was Prince Siddhatthaâs charioteer, and later ordained. He seems to have been a little obstinate, and is recorded as blaming the Chief Disciples. Also the last disciplinary act of the Buddha was in regard to this monk. I do not find anywhere though where he sided with heretics.]

âI scent the fragrance.â
 This story the Teacher, while living at Jetavana, told concerning a discontented monk. The Teacher asked if it were true that he longed for the world, and what had he seen to make him regret having taken orders. The monk answered, âIt was all owing to the charms of a woman.â The Teacher said: âVerily, monk, there is no possibility of being on oneâs guard against womenfolk. Sages of old, though they took the precaution to dwell in the abode of the Garuá¸·as, failed to be on their guard against them.â And being urged by him, the Teacher related a story of the past.
 [3.124]

1. âI scent the fragrance of the timira grove,

I hear the moaning of the weary sea:

Tamba, I am tormented with my love,

For fair SussondÄ« dwells afar from me.â

And Seruma in safety gain?

How did you Sagga, tell me, pray,

As though to her a true son I might be.


5. She food and raiment brought, and as I lay

Know, Tamba, well; this word is truth I say.â

The Teacher, his lesson ended, declared the Truths and identified the JÄtaka. At the conclusion of the Truths the worldly-minded monk attained fruition of the First Path. âAt that time Änanda was the king of Benares, and I myself was the Garuá¸·a king.â

âIs it thus, SudÄtha.â
 
[3.126] {3.191}
 This story the Teacher, while dwelling at Jetavana, told concerning the two chief disciples. On a certain occasion the two chief elders resolved during the rainy season to devote themselves to solitude. So they bade the Teacher farewell and leaving the company of the monks they went forth from Jetavana, carrying their bowl and robes with their own hands, and lived in a forest near a border village. And a certain man, who waited on the elders and lived upon their leftovers, dwelt apart in the same place. On seeing how happily these elders lived together, he thought: âI wonder if it is possible to set them at variance.â So he drew near to SÄriputta and said: âCan it be, venerable sir, that there is some quarrel between you and the venerable chief elder MoggallÄna?â âWhy so, sir?â he asked. âHe ever, venerable sir, speaks in your dispraise and says, âWhen I am gone, what is SÄriputta worth compared with me in caste, lineage, family and country, or in the power of Attainments in the sacred volumes?â The elder smiled and said: âBe off, sir!â


Another day he drew near to the chief elder MoggallÄna, and said the same thing. He too smiled and said: âBe off, sir!â MoggallÄna went to SÄriputta and asked, âHas this fellow, who lives on our leavings, said anything to you?â âYes, friend, he has.â âAnd he said exactly the same thing to me. We must drive him away.â âVery well, friend, drive him away.â The elder said: âYou are not to come here,â and snapping his fingers at him, he drove him away. The two elders lived happily together, and returning to the Teacher, made obeisance to him and sat down. The Teacher spoke kindly to them and asked if they had kept their retreat pleasantly. They said: âA certain beggar wished to set us at variance, but failing in the attempt he ran away.â The Teacher said: âVerily, SÄriputta, not only now, but formerly also, he thought to set you at variance, but failing in the attempt he ran away.â And hereupon at his request he related a story of bygone days.

1. âIs it thus SudÄá¹­ha 
SudÄá¹­ha (strong-tooth) is the lion, SubÄhu (strong-arm) the tiger.
 speaks of me?

In grace of form and pedigree,

In might and prowess in the field,

SubÄhu still to me must yield.â

2. âIs it thus SubÄhu speaks of me?

And neâer will by a strangerâs word

Be parted from his bosomâs lord.â

The Teacher, having brought his lesson to an end, identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the jackal was the beggar who lived on leftovers, the lion was SÄriputta, the tiger MoggallÄna, and the deity that dwelt in that forest and saw the whole thing with his own eyes was I myself.â

âVirtue and learning.â
 
[3.128]
 This story the Teacher, while residing at Jetavana, told concerning a brahmin who would test the power of virtue. The king, they say, owing to his reputation for virtue, regarded him with special honour, beyond what was paid to other brahmins. He thought: âCan it be that the king regards me with special honour, because I am endowed with virtue, or as one devoted to the acquisition of learning? I will just test the comparative importance of virtue and learning.â


So one day he abstracted a coin from the royal treasury board. The treasurer, such was his respect for him, did not say a word. It occurred a second time, and the treasurer said nothing. But on the third occasion he had him arrested as one who lived by robbery, and brought him before the king. And when the king asked what his offence was, he charged him with stealing the kingâs property. 
{3.194}


âIs this true, brahmin?â said the king.


âI am not in the habit of stealing your property, sire,â he said, âbut I had my doubts as to the relative importance of virtue and learning, and in testing which was the greater of the two, I thrice took a coin without permission, and then I was given into custody and brought before you. Now that I know the greater efficacy of virtue compared with learning, I no longer wish to live a laymanâs life. I will become an ascetic.â


On obtaining leave to do so, without so much as looking back on his house door, he went straight to Jetavana and begged the Teacher to ordain him. The Teacher granted him both novice and full monastic orders. And he had been no long time in orders, before he attained to Insight and reached Arahatship.


The incident was discussed in the Dhamma Hall, how that a certain brahmin, after proving the power of virtue, took orders and obtaining Insight became an Arahat. When the Teacher came and inquired of the monks what was the nature of the topic they were sitting to discuss, on hearing what it was, he said: âNot this man only now, but sages of old also put virtue to the proof, and by becoming ascetics worked out their own safety.â And herewith he told a story of the past.

1. âVirtue and learning I wanted to test;

Henceforth I doubt not that virtue is best.


2. Virtue excels vain gifts of form and birth,

Apart from virtue learning has no worth.


3. A prince or peasant, if to wrong enslaved,

In neither world from misery is saved.


4. Men of high caste with those of base degree,

If virtuous here, in heaven will equal be. 
{3.195}


5. Not birth, nor lore, nor friendship aught avails,

Pure virtue only future bliss entails.â

The Teacher here ended this lesson and identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time it was I myself that put virtue to the test and adopted the ascetic life.â

{3.196}
 This story the Teacher, when dwelling at Jetavana, told concerning a rich merchant, a friend of AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika, who lived in a border province. Both the introductory story and the story of the past are related in full in the concluding JÄtaka of the ninth division of the first book [Ja 90]. 
[
AkataÃ±Ã±ujÄtaka
. I include the stories here.]

On the borders, so the tale goes, there lived a merchant, who was a correspondent and a friend of AnÄthapiá¹á¸ikaâs, but they had never met. There came a time when this merchant loaded five hundred carts with local produce and gave orders to the men in charge to go to the great merchant AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika, and barter the wares in his correspondentâs shop for their value, and bring back the goods received in exchange. So they came to SÄvatthi, and found AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika. First making him a present, they told him their business. âYou are welcome,â said the great man, and ordered them to be lodged there and provided with money for their needs. After kindly enquiries after their masterâs health, he bartered their merchandise and gave them the goods in exchange. Then they went back to their own district, and reported what had happened.


Shortly afterwards, AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika similarly dispatched five hundred carts with merchandise to the very district in which they dwelt; and his people, when they had got there, went, present in hand, to call upon the border merchant. âWhere do you come from?â said he. âFrom SÄvatthi,â replied they; âfrom your correspondent, AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika.â âAnyone can call himself AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika,â said he with a sneer; and taking their present, he bade them begone, giving them neither lodging nor a gift. So they bartered their goods for themselves and brought back the wares in exchange to SÄvatthi, with the story of the reception they had had.


Now it chanced that this border merchant dispatched another caravan of five hundred carts to SÄvatthi; and his people came with a present in their hands to wait upon AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika. But, as soon as AnÄthapiá¹á¸ikaâs people caught sight of them, they said: âOh, weâll see, sir, that they are properly lodged, fed, and supplied with money for their needs.â And they took the strangers outside the city and bade them unyoke their carts at a suitable spot, adding that rice and a gift would come from AnÄthapiá¹á¸ikaâs house. About the middle watch of the night, having collected a band of serving-men and slaves, they looted the whole caravan, carried off every garment the men had got, drove away their oxen, and took the wheels off the carts, leaving the latter but removing the wheels. Without so much as a shirt among the lot of them, the terrified strangers sped away and managed to reach their home on the border. Then AnÄthapiá¹á¸ikaâs people told him the whole story. âThis capital story,â said he, âshall be my gift to the Teacher today,â and away he went and told it to the Teacher.


âThis is not the first time, sir,â said the Teacher, âthat this border merchant has shown this disposition; he was just the same in days gone by.â Then, at AnÄthapiá¹á¸ikaâs request, he told the following story of the past.

1. âWho spite of honour, while he plays the part

Of humble servant, loathes you in his heart,

Poor in good works and rich in words alone â

Ah! Such a friend you surely would not own. 
[3.130]


2. Be you in deed to every promise true,

Refuse to promise what you can not do;

Wise men on empty braggarts look askew.


3. No friend suspects a quarrel without cause,

For ever watching to discover flaws:

But he that trustful on a friend can rest,

As little child upon its motherâs breast,

Will neâer by any strangerâs deed or word,

Be separated from his bosomâs lord.


4. Who draws the yoke of human friendship well,

Of bliss increased and honoured life can tell:


5. But one that tastes the joys of calm repose,

Drinking sweet draughts of Truth â he only knows

Escape from defilements and all his woes.â 
{3.197}

The Teacher, his lesson ended, thus identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time I myself was the merchant of Benares.â

## Full Story
âLo! Here we lie.â
 This story the Teacher, while living at Jetavana, told concerning an aged monk. The story has already been related in full in the SÄlakajÄtaka [Ja 85]. 
[However, nothing occurs in the earlier story that isnât told here.]


In this version also the old man after ordaining a village lad abuses and strikes him. The lad escaped and returned to the world. 
{3.198}
 The old man once more admitted him to orders, and acted just as before. The youth, after he had for the third time returned to the world, on being again solicited to come back, would not so much as look the old man in the face.


The matter was talked over in the Dhamma Hall, how that a certain elder could live neither with his novice nor without him, while the boy after seeing the old manâs temper, being a sensitive youth, would not even look at him. The Teacher came 
[3.131]
 and asked what was the subject of discussion. When they told him, he said: âNot only now, monks, but formerly also this same youth was a sensitive novice, who after observing the elderâs faults would not so much as look at him.â And so saying he told a story of the past.

1. âLo! Here we lie, my pretty one,

Like gambler by the dice undone.

Let fall some mangoes: well we know,

Our living to your tricks we owe.â

2. âYour praises, friend, unmeaning sound;

A pretty monkey neâer was found. 
{3.199}


3. Who in the stores, when drunk, I pray,

Did starve and beat me sore today?


4. When I, snake-charmer, call to mind

The bed of pain where I reclined,

Though I should some day be a king,

No prayer from me this boon should wring,

Your cruelty remembering.


5. But if a man is known to live

Content at home, is apt to give,

And springs of gentle race, the wise

With such should form the closest ties.â

The Teacher here ended his lesson and identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the old man was the snake-charmer, the novice was the monkey, and I myself was the corn merchant.â

 This story was told by the Teacher while dwelling at Jetavana, about a monk who regretted taking ordination. The Teacher asked him if it were true that he regretted it. âIt is true, venerable sir,â he said. âWhat have you seen to cause this feeling?â asked the Teacher. When the monk replied, âIt was owing to the charms of a woman,â the Teacher said: âThese five qualities of desire are like the honey sprinkled over with deadly poison, and left in the road by one Gumbiya.â And hereupon at the request of the monk he told a story of the past.

1. âPoison like honey in look, taste, and smell,

Was laid by Gumbiya with purpose fell:


2. All who as honey ate the noxious food,

Through their own greed did perish in the wood.


3. But they who wisely from the bait abstained,

Were free from torture and at peace remained.


4. So lust, like poison-bait, for man is laid;

His heartâs desire has oft to death betrayed.


5. But who, though frail, his defilements forego,

Escape from bonds of suffering and woe.â

The Teacher, after delivering these verses spoken after Fully Awakening, revealed the Truths and identified the JÄtaka, 
{3.202}
 At the conclusion of the Truths the discontented monk attained the fruit of the First Path. âAt that time I myself was that merchant.â

## Full Story
âWho got his friend.â
 This was a story told by the Teacher, while living in the Bamboo Grove, in reference to a saying that Devadatta could not even inspire alarm. 
[Ja 358 
CulladhammapÄlajÄtaka
 tells this story at length, most of which I include here.]

This story the Teacher, when dwelling in the Bamboo Grove, told concerning the going about of Devadatta to slay the Bodhisatta. In all other births Devadatta failed to excite so much as an atom of fear in the Bodhisatta, but in the CulladhammapÄlajÄtaka [Ja 358], when the Bodhisatta was only seven months old, he had his hands and feet and head cut off and his body encircled with sword cuts, as it were with a garland. In the DaddarajÄtaka [Ja 438]  he killed him by twisting his neck, and roasted his flesh in an oven and ate it. In the KhantivÄdijÄtaka [Ja 313] he had him scourged with two thousand strokes of a whip, and ordered his hands and feet and ears and nose to be cut off, and then had him seized by the hair of his head and dragged along, and when he was stretched at full length on his back, he kicked him in the belly and made off, and that very day the Bodhisatta died. But both in the CullanandakajÄtaka [Ja 222] and the Vevaá¹­iyakapijÄtaka [Ja 516]  he merely had him put to death. Thus did Devadatta for a long time go about trying to slay him, and continued to do so, even after he became a Buddha.


So one day they raised a discussion in the Dhamma Hall, saying: âSirs, Devadatta is continually forming plots to slay the Buddhas. Being minded to kill the Supreme Buddha, he instigated archers to shoot him, he threw down a rock upon him, and let loose the elephant NÄlÄgiri on him.â When the Teacher came and inquired what subject the monks were assembled to discuss, on hearing what it was he said: âMonks, not only now, but formerly too he went about to kill me, but now he fails to excite a particle of fear in me...â And so saying, he related a story of the past.

1. âWho got his friend to seize

A deadly snake, as hedgehog, if you please,

By the snakeâs bite was killed

As one that evil to his neighbour willed.


2-3. 
[The second and third verses are almost exact replicas with only one word change between them.]
 He that to strike is fain

The man that never striketh back again,

Is struck and lieth low,

Eâen as this cheat sore hurt by deadly blow.


4. So dust that should be thrown

Against the wind, back in oneâs face is blown;


5. And ill designed to one

That holy is, and has no evil done,

On the foolâs pate at last

Recoils, like dust when thrown against the blast.â

The Teacher here ended his lesson and identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the poor old doctor was Devadatta, the wise youth was myself.â

He should not grieve but acquiesce;

; it refers the reader to Ja 427 
GijjhajÄtaka
, for the Introductory story, which I include here. I also include the opening of the story of the past, which is omitted from this retelling.]

This story the Teacher told at Jetavana concerning a disobedient monk. He was, they say, of gentle birth, and though ordained in the dispensation that leads to safety, was admonished by his well-wishers, masters, teachers, and fellow-students to this effect, âThus must you advance and thus retreat; thus look at or away from objects; thus must the arm be stretched out or drawn back; thus are the inner and outer garment to be worn; thus is the bowl to be held, and when you have received sufficient food to sustain life, after self-examination, thus are you to partake of it, keeping guard over the door of the senses; in eating you are to be moderate and exercise watchfulness; you are to recognize such and such duties towards monks who come to or go from the monastery; these are the fourteen sets of monastic duties, and the eighty great duties to be duly performed; these are the thirteen ascetic practices; all these are to be scrupulously performed.â Yet was he disobedient and impatient, and did not receive instruction respectfully, but refused to listen to them, saying: âI do not find fault with you. Why do you speak thus to me? I shall know what is for my good, and what is not.â


Then the monks, hearing of his disobedience, sat in the Dhamma Hall, telling of his faults. The Teacher came and asked them what it was they were discussing, and sent for the monk and said: âIs it true, monk, that you are disobedient?â And when he confessed that it was so, the Teacher said: âWhy, monk, after being ordained in so excellent a dispensation that leads to safety, do you not listen to the voice of your well-wishers? Formerly too you disobeyed the voice of the wise, and were blown into atoms by the Veramba wind.â And herewith he told a story of the past.

1. âWhat was the evil wrought by me,

Thus to provoke the curse of heaven,

That my poor head should ever be

With circling wheel of torture riven?â 
{3.207}

2. âForsaking homes of joy and bliss,

That decked with pearls, with crystal this,

And halls of gold and silver sheen,

What brought you to this gloomy scene?â

3. âFar fuller joys I there shall gain

Than any these poor worlds can show.

This was the thought that proved my bane

And brought me to this scene of woe.â

4. âFrom four to eight, to sixteen thence, and so

To thirty-two insatiate greed does grow.

Thus on and on you, greedy soul, were led

Till doomed to wear this wheel upon your head.


5. So all, pursuing covetous desire,

Insatiate still, yet more and more require:

The broadening path of appetite they tread,

And, like you, bear this wheel upon their headâ 
[3.137]

The Teacher, his lesson ended, identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the unruly monk was Mittavindaka, and I myself was the Devaputta.â

## Full Story
âThe goose said to the Flame of the Forest.â
 This was a story told by the Teacher, while residing at Jetavana, concerning overcoming wrong. The incident that led to the story will be set forth in the PaÃ±Ã±ÄjÄtaka [Ja 4590]. 
[This is evidently another name for Ja 459 
PÄnÄ«yajÄtaka
. I include the story here.]

This story the Teacher told, while dwelling in Jetavana, about the subduing of evil passions.


At one time, we learn, five hundred citizens of SÄvatthi, being householders and friends of the TathÄgata, had heard the Dhamma and had renounced the world, and been ordained as monastics. Living in the house of the Golden Pavement, at midnight they indulged in thoughts of wrong.


The Teacher regards his disciples three times a night and three times a day, six times every night and day, as a jay guards her egg, or a yak-cow her tail, or a mother her beloved son, or a one-eyed man his remaining eye; so in the very instant he overcame wrong which was beginning. He was observing Jetavana on that midnight and knowing the monksâ conduct and their thoughts, he considered, âThis wrong among these monks if it grows will destroy the foundation for becoming an Arahat. I will this moment repudiate this wrong and show them how to become Arahats,â so leaving the perfumed chamber he called Änanda, and bidding him collect all the monks dwelling in the place, he got them together and sat down on the seat prepared for Buddha.


At the command of the Fortunate One, the Saá¹gha was assembled by the venerable Änanda.

But on this occasion the Teacher addressing the monks said: âMonks, wrong ought to be regarded with suspicion. Though it be as small as a banyan shoot, it may prove fatal. Sages of old too suspected whatever was open to suspicion.â And with this he related a story of the past.

1. âThe goose said to the Flaming tree, 
[
Butea Frondosa
, Flame of the Forest.]

A banyan shoot is threatening you:

What you do in your bosom rear

Will rend you limb from limb, I fear.â

2. âWell! Let it grow, and should I be

A refuge to the banyan tree,

And tend it with a parentâs love,

It will to me a blessing prove.â

3. âIt is a cursed shoot, I fear,

You do within your bosom rear.

I say goodbye and off I flee,

This growth, alas, misliketh me.â

4. âA spectre grim like Meruâs height

Has brought me to a fearful plight;

Scorning the words friend gosling said,

I now am overwhelmed with dread.â

5. âWise men abhor the parasitic thing

That chokes the form to which it loves to cling.

The wise, suspecting danger from the weed,

Destroy the root before it comes to seed.â

The Teacher here, his lesson ended, revealed the Truths and identified the JÄtaka. At the conclusion of the Truths five hundred monks became Arahats, âAt that time I myself was the golden goose.â

[3.139] {3.211}
 This story the Teacher, while dwelling at Jetavana, told concerning some quarrelsome folk from KosambÄ«. When they came to Jetavana, the Teacher addressed them at the time of their reconciliation and said: âMonks, you are my lawful sons in the faith, begotten by the words of my mouth. Children ought not to trample under foot the counsel given them by their father, but you follow not my admonition. Sages of old, when the men who had slain their parents and seized upon their kingdom fell into their hands in the forest, did not put them to death, though they were confirmed rebels, but they said: âWe will not trample on the counsel given us by our parents.â And hereupon he related a story of the past. In this JÄtaka both the incident that led up to the story and the story itself will be fully set forth in the Saá¹ghabhedakajÄtaka [Ja 428]. 
[This is evidently another name for Ja 428

. I include the Introductory story here, but the past life story there does not lead up to the following incident, so I include the story from Horner and BrahmÄliâs translation of the Vinaya story as told in Mv 10. Note the Vinaya style is very different.]

This story the Teacher, while dwelling in the Ghosita park near KosambÄ«, told concerning certain quarrelsome folk at KosambÄ«. The incident that led to the story is to be found in The Section with the Vinaya relating to KosambÄ«. Here is a short summary of it. At that time, it is said, two monks lived in the same house, the one versed in the Vinaya, the other in the Suttas. The latter of these one day having occasion to visit the lavatory went out leaving the surplus water for rinsing the mouth in a vessel. Afterwards the one versed in the Vinaya went in and seeing the water came out and asked his companion if the water had been left there by him. He answered, âYes, sir.â âWhat! Do you not know that this is wrong?â âNo, I was not aware of it.â âWell, monk, it is wrong.â âThen I will atone for it.â âBut if you did it inadvertently and heedlessly, it is not wrong.â So he became as one who saw no wrong in what was wrongful.


The Vinaya scholar said to his pupils, âThis Sutta scholar, though falling into wrong, is not aware of it.â They on seeing the other monkâs pupils said: âYour master though falling into wrong does not recognize its wrongfulness.â They went and told their master. He said: âThis Vinaya scholar before said it was no wrong, and now he says it is wrong: he speaks falsely.â They went and told the others, âYour master speaks falsely.â Thus they stirred up a quarrel, one with another. Then the Vinaya scholar, finding an opportunity, went through the form of suspension of the monk for refusing to see his offence. Thenceforth even the laymen who provided necessaries for the monks were divided into two factions. The nuns too that accept their admonitions, and tutelary gods, with their friends and intimates and deities from those that rest in space to those of the Brahma World, even all such as were unconverted, formed two parties, and the uproar reached to the abode of the Akaniá¹­á¹­ha gods.


Then a certain monk drew near to the TathÄgata, and announced the view of the suspending side who said: âThe man is legally suspended,â and the view of the followers of the suspended one, who said: âHe is illegally suspended,â and the practice of those who though forbidden by the suspending side, still gathered round in support of him. The Fortunate One said: âThere is a schism, yes, a schism in the Saá¹gha,â and he went to them and pointed out the misery involved in suspension to those that suspended, and the misery following upon the concealment of the wrong to the opposite party, and so departed.


Again when they were holding the Uposatha and similar services in the same place, within the boundary, and were quarrelling in the refectory and elsewhere, he laid down the rule that they were to sit down together, one by one from each side alternately. And hearing that they were still quarrelling in the monastery he went there and said: âEnough, monks, let us have no quarrelling.â And one of the heretical side, not wishing to annoy the Fortunate One, said: âLet the Fortunate One, the master of the Dhamma, dwell quietly at ease, enjoying the bliss he has already obtained in this life. We shall make ourselves notorious by this quarrelling, altercation, disputing and contention.â

1. âYou are within my power, O king,

As prone you liest here:

What stratagem have you to bring

Deliverance from your fear?â

2. âWithin your power, my friend, I lie

All helpless on the ground,

Nor know I any means whereby

Deliverance may be found.â 
{3.212}

3. âGood deeds and words alone, not wealth, O king,

In hour of death can any comfort bring. 


4. This man abused me, 
Dhp v. 3-5.
 that struck me a blow,

A third oâercame and robbed me long ago. 

All such as harbour feelings of this kind,

To mitigate their wrath are neâer inclined. 


5. He did abuse and buffet me of yore,

He overcame me and oppressed me sore. 
[3.140]


They who such thoughts refuse to entertain,

Appease their wrath and live at one again. 


6. Not hate, but love alone makes hate to cease:

This is the everlasting law of peace.â

## Full Story
âTo sorrow for the dead.â
 This story the Teacher, while dwelling at Jetavana, told about a certain elder. It is said that he admitted a youth to orders, and that this novice, after ministering to him zealously, by and by fell sick and died. The old man overcome with grief at the youthâs death went about loudly lamenting. The monks, failing to console him, raised a discussion in the Dhamma Hall, saying: âA certain old man on the death of his novice goes about lamenting. By dwelling on the thought of death, he will surely become a castaway.â When the Teacher came, he inquired of the monks what was the subject they had met to discuss, and on hearing what it was he said: âNot only now, but formerly also, the old man went about lamenting, when this youth died.â And with this he related a story of the past.

1. âTo sorrow for the dead does ill become

The lone ascetic, free from ties of home.â

2. âShould man with beast consort, O Sakka, grief

For a lost playmate finds in tears relief.â

3. âSuch as to weep are fain may still lament the dead,

Weep not, O sage, âtis vain to weep, the wise have said.


4. If by our tears we might prevail against the grave,

Thus would we all unite our dearest ones to save.â

5. âAs ghee-fed flame that blazes out amain

Is quenched with water, so he quenched my pain.


6. With sorrowâs shaft my heart was wounded sore:

He healed my wound and did my life restore.


7. The barb extracted, full of joy and peace,

At Sakkaâs words I from my sorrow cease.â

The Teacher here ended his lesson and identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the old man was the ascetic, the novice was the deer, and I myself was Sakka.â

## Full Story
âPeople cry, âWhere is she gone.â â
 
[3.142]
 This story the Teacher, while residing in the Bamboo Grove, told about AjÄtasattu. The incident that led to the story has already been fully told in the ThusajÄtaka [Ja 338].

At the time of his conception there arose in his mother, the daughter of the king of Kosala, a chronic longing to drink blood from the right knee of (her husband) king BimbisÄra. Being questioned by her attendant ladies, she told them how it was with her. The king too hearing of it called his astrologers and said: âThe queen is possessed of such and such a longing. What will be the issue of it?â The astrologers said: âThe child conceived in the womb of the queen will kill you and seize your kingdom.â âIf my son,â said the king, âshould kill me and seize my kingdom, what is the harm of it?â And then he had his right knee opened with a sword and letting the blood fall into a golden dish gave it to the queen to drink. She thought: âIf the son that is born of me should kill his father, what care I for him?â and endeavoured to bring about a miscarriage. The king hearing of it called her to him and said: âMy dear, it is said, my son will slay me and seize my kingdom. But I am not exempt from old age and death: suffer me to behold the face of my child. Henceforth act not after this manner.â But she still went to the garden and acted as before. The king on hearing of it forbade her visits to the garden, and when she had gone her full time she gave birth to a son. On his naming-day, because he had been his fatherâs enemy, while still unborn, they called him prince AjÄtasattu.


As he grew up with his princely surroundings, one day the Teacher accompanied by five hundred monks came to the kingâs palace and sat down. The assembly of the monks with Buddha at their head was entertained by the king with choice food, both hard and soft. And after saluting the Teacher the king sat down to listen to the Dhamma. At this moment they dressed up the young prince and brought him to the king. The king welcomed the child with a strong show of affection and placed him on his lap, and fondling the boy with the natural love of a father for his child, he did not listen to the Dhamma.

Here too the Teacher observed the king at the same moment playing with his boy and also listening to the Dhamma. And knowing as he did that danger to the king will arise through his son, he said: âSire, kings of old suspected what was open to suspicion, and kept their heirs in confinement, saying: âLet them bear rule, after our bodies have been burned on the funeral pyre.â And with this he told a story of the past.

1. âPeople cry, âWhere is she gone?

MÅ«sikÄ, where have you fled?

This is known to me alone:

In the well she lieth dead.â â

2. âLike a beast of burden still

You do turn and turn about,

You that MÅ«sikÄ 
MÅ«sikÄ
 means mouse, 
Yava,
 barley
.
 did kill,

Fain would Yava eat, I doubt.â 
[3.144] {3.218}

3. âYou are but a weakling fool,

Like a baby with its toy,

Grasping this long spoon-like tool,

I will slay you, wretched boy.â

4. âI am not free by dwelling in the sky,

Nor by some act of filial piety.

Nay when my life was sought by this my son,

Escape from death through power of verse was won.


5. Knowledge of every kind he apt to learn,

And what it all may signify discern:

Though you should use it not, the time will be

When what you hearest may advantage you.â 
{3.219}

The Teacher here brought his lesson to a close, and identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the far-famed teacher was myself.â

 This story was told by the Teacher while living at Jetavana, about the temptation of a monk by the wife of his unregenerate days. When the monk confessed that it was owing to the wife 
[3.145]
 he had left, that he regretted having taken orders, the Teacher said: âNot only now, monk, did this woman do you a mischief. Formerly too it was owing to her that your head was cut off.â And at the request of the monks he related a story of the past.

1. âSince you have gained the other side,

With all my goods in bundle tied,

Return as quickly as may be

And carry me across with thee.â

2. âYour fancy, lady, ever roves

From well-tried faith to lighter loves, 
{3.222}

Me too you would before long betray,

Should I not hence flee far away.â

3. âWho makes the cassia thicket ring

With laughter, though none dance or sing,

Or clap their hands, good time to keep?

Fair one, laugh not, when you should weep.â

4. âO silly jackal, you must wish

You had not lost both flesh and fish.

Poor fool! Well may you grieve to see

What comes of your stupidity.â

5. âAnotherâs faults are plainly seen,

âTis hard to see oneâs own, I ween.

I think you too must count the cost,

When spouse and lover both are lost.â 
{3.224}

6. âKing jackal, âtis just as you say,

So I will go me far away,

And seek another wedded love

And strive a faithful wife to prove.â 
[3.148]

7. âHe that would steal a pot of clay

Would steal a brass one any day:

So she who was her husbandâs bane

Will be as bad or worse again.â

At the conclusion of the Truths the discontented monk attained the fruit of the First Path: âAt that time the discontented monk was the Archer, the wife he had left was that woman, and I myself was Sakka, king of heaven.â

âNeâer be angry.â
 
 [3.151] {3.228}
 The Teacher told this tale while dwelling at Jetavana, about a ferryman. This man, they say, was foolish and ignorant: he knew not the qualities of the Three Jewels and of all excellent beings: he was hasty, rough and violent. A certain country monk, wishing to wait on the Buddha, came one evening to the ferry on the AciravatÄ« and said to the ferryman, âLay brother, I wish to cross, let me have your boat.â âSir, it is too late, stay here.â âLay brother, I cannot stay here, take me across.â The ferryman said angrily, âCome then, ascetic,â and took him into the boat: but he steered badly and made the boat ship water, so that the monkâs robe was wet, and it was dark before he put him on the farther bank. When the monk reached the monastery, he could not wait on the Buddha that day. Next day he went to the Teacher, saluted and sat on one side. The Teacher gave greeting and asked when he had come. âYesterday.â âThen why do you not wait on me till today?â When he heard his reason, the Teacher said: âNot only now, but of old also that man was rough: and he annoyed wise men of old, as he did you.â And when asked he told a story of the past.

1. âNeâer be angry, prince of warriors; neâer be angry, lord of earth:

Anger neâer requite with anger: thus a king is worship-worth.


2. In the village, in the forest, on the sea or on the shore,

Neâer be angry, prince of warriors: âtis my counsel evermore.â 
[The first line of the second verse is also found at Dhp 98.]

3. âThe father of AvÄriya,

His boatâs on Ganges wave:

He ferries first the folk across,

And then his fare heâll crave:

And that is why he earns but strife,

A thriftless, luckless, cheat!â

4. âAsk your fare before the crossing, never on the further shore:

Different minds have folk you ferry, different after and before.â 
{3.231}

5. âIn the village, in the forest, on the sea, and on the shore,

Neâer be angry, my good boatman; âtis my counsel evermore.â 
[3.153]

6. âFor counsel good the king bestowed the revenue of a town:

The boatman for the same advice has knocked the giver down.â

7. âThe rice was spilt, his wife was struck, child killed before its birth,

To him, like fine gold to a beast, counsel was nothing worth.â

When the Teacher had ended his lesson, he declared the Truths: after the Truths the brother was established in the fruit of the First Path: and he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the ferryman was the ferryman of today, the king was Änanda, the ascetic was myself.â

âFriend, be not angry.â
 The Teacher told this tale at Jetavana, of a deceitful monk. The occasion of the story will appear in the UddÄlajÄtaka [Ja 487].

This story the Teacher told, while dwelling in Jetavana, about a dishonest monk. This man, even though dedicated to the dispensation that leads to safety, notwithstanding to gain lifeâs necessaries fulfilled the threefold cheating practice [seeking requisites, seeking honour and hinting].


The monks brought to light all the evil parts in the man as they conversed together in the Dhamma Hall, âSuch a one, monks, after he had dedicated himself to this dispensation which leads to safety, yet lives in deceit!â The Teacher came in, and would know what they talked of there. They told him. Said he, âThis is not now the first time; he was deceitful before,â and so saying he told a story of the past.
 [3.154]

1. âFriend, be not angry, anger is not good:

Wisdom is more than you have seen or heard: 
{3.234}

By quarter parents may be understood,

And teacher is denoted by the word.


2. The householder who gives food, clothes and drink,

Whose doors are open, he a quarter is:

And quarter in the highest sense, we think,

Is that last state where misery shall be bliss.â 
This rests on fanciful puns on the names of the four quarters.
 
{3.235}

3. âWith uncleansed teeth, and goatskin garb and hair

All matted, muttering holy words in peace:

Surely no human means to good they spare,

They know the Truth, and they have won Release.â

4. âA learned sage may do ill deeds, O king:

A learned sage may fail to follow right:

A thousand Vedas will not safety bring,

Failing just works, or save from evil plight.â

5. âA learned sage may do ill deeds, O king:

A learned sage may fail to follow right

You say: âThen Vedas are a useless thing:

Just works with self-restraint are requisite.â â

6. âNay, Vedas are not useless utterly:

Though works with self-restraint true Dhamma is:

Study of Vedas lifts manâs name on high,

But âtis by conduct that he reaches bliss.â

After the lesson the Teacher identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time Setaketu was the cheating monk, the outcaste was SÄriputta, and the kingâs priest was myself.â

âPleasures of sense.â
 
{3.238}
 This tale was told by the Teacher while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning the Great Renunciation. The incident that led to the story has been told before. 
[NidÄnakathÄ p. 61-65. I give an abbreviated version of it here.]

...the future Buddha, making light of the kingdom of the world, thus within his reach â casting it away as one would saliva â left the city with great honour on the full-moon day of ÄsÄá¸·ha, when the moon was in the UttarÄsÄá¸·ha lunar mansion (i.e. on the Full Moon day in July)...


For then, they say, Devas in front of him carried sixty thousand torches, and behind him too, and on his right hand, and on his left...


Advancing in this pomp and glory, the Bodhisatta, in that one night, passed beyond three kingdoms, and arrived, at the end of thirty leagues, at the bank of the river called AnomÄ...


Now the Bodhisatta, stopping at the river side, asked Channa, âWhat is this river called?â


âIts name, my lord, is AnomÄ.â


âAnd so also our renunciation of the world shall be called AnomÄ (Illustrious),â said he; and signalling to his horse, by pressing it with his heel, the horse sprang over the river, five or six hundred yards in breadth, and stood on the opposite bank.


The Bodhisatta, getting down from the horseâs back, stood on the sandy beach, extending there like a sheet of silver, and said to Channa, âGood Channa, do you now go back, taking my ornaments and Kanthaka. I am going to become an ascetic.â


âBut I also, my lord, will become an ascetic.â


âYou cannot be allowed to renounce the world, you must go back,â he said. Three times he refused this request of Channaâs; and he delivered over to him both the ornaments and Kanthaka.


Then he thought: âThese locks of mine are not suited for a mendicant. Now it is not right for any one else to cut the hair of a future Buddha, so I will cut them off myself with my sword.â Then, taking his sword in his right hand, and holding the plaited tresses, together with the diadem on them, with his left, he cut them off. So his hair was thus reduced to two inches in length, and curling from the right, it lay close to his head. It remained that length as long as he lived, and the beard the same. There was no need at all to shave either hair or beard any more.


The Bodhisatta, saying to himself, âIf I am to become a Buddha, let it stand in the air; if not, let it fall to the ground;â threw the hair and diadem together as he held them towards the sky...


Again the Bodhisatta thought: âThis my raiment of Benares muslin is not suitable for a mendicant.â Now the Deva Ghaá¹­ikÄra, who had formerly been his friend in the time of Kassapa, the One with Ten Powers, was led by his friendship, which had not grown old in that long interval, to think, âToday my friend is accomplishing the Great Renunciation, I will go and provide him with the requisites of a mendicant.â

273. âThe three robes, and the alms bowl,

Razor, needle, and girdle,

And a water strainer â these eight

Are the wealth of the monk devout.â

Taking these eight requisites of a mendicant, he gave them to him. The Bodhisatta dressed himself in the outward signs of an Arahat, and adopted the sacred garb of Renunciation; and he enjoined upon Channa to go and, in his name, assure his parents of his safety. And Channa did homage to the Bodhisatta reverently, and departed.

1. âPleasures of sense are but morass and mire:

The triply-rooted terror them I call.

Vapour and dust I have proclaimed them, sire:

Having gone forth you should forsake them all.â 
{3.242}

2. âInfatuate, bound and deeply stained am I,

Brahmin, with pleasures: fearful they may be,

But I love life, and cannot them deny:

Good works I undertake continually.â 
{3.243}

3. âHe who rejects the counsel of his friend,

Who pities him, and would avert his doom,

Thinking this world is better, finds no end,

Foolish, of long rebirths within the womb.


4. That fearful place of punishment is his,

Full of all filth, held evil by the good:

The greedy their desires can neâer dismiss,

The flesh imprisons all the carnal brood.â 
{3.244}

5. âCovered with blood and with gross foulness stained,

All mortal beings issue from the birth:

Whateâer they touch thereafter is ordained

To bring them pain and sorrow on the earth.


6a. I speak what I have seen, not what I hear

From others: I remember times of old.â 
[3.159] {3.245}

If Sumedha is a proper name, this must be taken from another story: but it may mean merely âwise.â

The lesson ended, the Teacher declared the Truths: then many attained the First Path and the rest: and he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the king was myself.â

âRavens and crows.â
 The Teacher told this tale in Jetavana concerning a certain monk. The story is that he got instruction in meditation from the Teacher and then went to a frontier village. There the people, pleased with his behaviour, fed him, built him a hut in the wood, and exacting a promise, made him live there, and gave him great honour. But they forsook him for the teachers of the permanence of matter, afterwards forsaking those for the sect who deny immortality, and those again for the sect of naked ascetics: for teachers of all these sects came among them in turn. So he was unhappy 
[3.160]
 among those people who knew not good and evil, and after the rains and the Invitation 
The festival at the end of the rains.
 he went back to the Teacher, and at his request told him where he had stayed during the Rains Retreat and that he had been unhappy among people who knew not good and evil. The Teacher said: âSages of old, even when born as beasts, stayed not a day among those who knew not good and evil, why have you done so?â and so he told the tale.

## Full Story
âIn heavenly garden.â
 
[3.161]
 The Teacher told this tale while dwelling at Jetavana, concerning the temptation of a monk by his former wife. The occasion will appear in the IndriyajÄtaka [Ja 423].

The story is that a young man of good family at SÄvatthi heard the Teacherâs preaching, and thinking it impossible to lead a holy life, perfectly complete and pure, as a householder, he determined to become an ascetic in the dispensation which leads to safety and so make an end of misery. So he gave up his house and property to his wife and children, and asked the Teacher to ordain him. The Teacher did so. As he was the junior in his going about for alms with his teachers and instructors, and as the monks were many, he got no chair either in laymenâs houses or in the refectory, but only a stool or a bench at the end of the novices, his food was tossed him hastily on a ladle, he got gruel made of broken lumps of rice, solid food stale or decaying, or sprouts dried and burnt; and this was not enough to keep him alive. He took what he had got to the wife he had left: she took his bowl, saluted him, emptied it and gave him instead well-cooked gruel and rice with sauce and curry.


The monk was captivated by the love of such flavours and could not leave his wife. She thought she would test his affection. One day she had a countryman cleansed with white clay and set down in her house with some others of his people whom she had sent for, and she gave them something to eat and drink. They sat eating and enjoying it. At the house-door she had some bullocks bound to wheels and a cart set ready. She herself sat in a back room cooking cakes. Her husband came and stood at the door. Seeing him, one old servant told his mistress that there was an elder at the door. âSalute him and bid him pass on.â


But though he did so repeatedly, he saw the monk remaining there and told his mistress. She came, and lifting up the curtain to see, she cried, âThis is the father of my sons.â She came out and saluted him: taking his bowl and making him enter she gave him food: when he had eaten she saluted again and said: âSir, you are a saint now: we have been staying in this house all this time; but there can be no proper householderâs life without a master, so we will take another house and go far into the country: be zealous in your good works, and forgive me if I am doing wrong.â For a time her husband was as if his heart would break. Then he said: âI cannot leave you, do not go, I will come back to my worldly life; send a laymanâs garment to such and such a place, I will give up my bowl and robes and come back to you.â She agreed. The monk went to his monastery, and giving up his bowl and robes to his teachers and instructors he explained, in answer to their questions, that he could not leave his wife and was going back to worldly life.

The Teacher found that the monk was discontent owing to thoughts of his wife, so he said: âSir, this woman does you harm: formerly also for her sake you sacrificed an army of the four divisions and dwelt in the HimÄlayas three years in much misery,â so he told a story of the past.

1. âIn heavenly garden grows ÄsÄvatÄ«;

Once in a thousand years, no more, the tree

Bears fruit: for it the gods wait patiently.


2. Hope on, O king, the fruit of hope is sweet:

A bird hoped on and never ownâd defeat.


3. His wish, though far away, he won complete:

Hope on, O king: the fruit of hope is sweet.â

4. âYou please me but with words and not in deed:

The scentless flower, though fair, is but a weed.


5. Promise fair without performance on his friends one throws away,

Never giving, ever hoarding: such is friendshipâs sure decay.


6. Men should speak when they will act, not promise what they cannot do:

If they talk without performing, wise men see them through and through.


7. My troops are wasted, all my stores are spent,

I doubt my life is spoilt: âtis time I went.â 
{3.254}

8. âPrince, you have said the word that is my name:

Come, king: my father will allow the claim.â

After the lesson, the Teacher declared the Truths and identified the JÄtaka, After the Truths, the monk was established in the Fruition of the First Path, âÄsaá¹kÄ was the former wife, the king was the discontented monk, the ascetic was myself.â

âWho is this.â
 
{3.257}
 The Teacher told this tale in Jetavana concerning AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika. From the time when he was established in the fruition of the First Path he kept the Five Precepts unbroken; so also did his wife, his sons and daughters, his hired servants and his workers.


One day in the Dhamma Hall they began to discuss whether AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika was pure himself and his household also. The Teacher came and was told their subject: so he said: âMonks, the wise men of old had pure households,â and told a story of the past.

1. âWho is this so dark of hue,

So unlovely to the view?

Who are you, whose daughter, say,

How are we to know you, pray?â

2. âThe great king VirÅ«pakkha is my sire:

I am Unlucky, KÄlakaá¹á¹Ä« dire:

Give me the house-room near you I desire.â

3. âWhat the conduct, what the ways,

Of the men with whom you dwell

This is what my question prays:

We will mark the answer well.â

4. âThe hypocrite, the wanton, the morose,

The man of envy, greed and treachery:

Such are the friends I love: and I dispose

Their gains that they may perish utterly.â 
[3.167] {3.260}

5. âAnd dearer still are ire and hate to me,

Slander and strife, libel and cruelty.


6. The shiftless wight who knows not his own good,

Resenting counsel, to his betters rude:


7. The man whom folly drives, whom friends despise,

He is my friend, in him my pleasure lies.â 
{3.261}

8. âKÄli, depart: thereâs naught to please you here:

To other lands and cities disappear.â

9. âI know you well: thereâs naught to please me here.

Others are luckless, who amass much gear;

My brother-god and I will make it disappear.â

10. âWho is this, divine of hue,

On the ground so firm and true?

Who are you, whose daughter, say,

How are we to know you, pray?â 
{3.262}

11. âThe great king Dhataraá¹­á¹­ha is my sire:

Fortune and Luck am I, and Wisdom men admire:

Grant me the house-room with you I desire.â

12. âWhat the conduct, what the ways

Of the men with whom you dwell?

This is what my question prays;

We will mark your answer well.â


13. âHe who in cold and heat, in wind and sun,

Mid thirst and hunger, snake and poison-fly,

His present duty night and day hath done;

With him I dwell and love him faithfully.


14. Gentle and friendly, righteous, liberal,

Guileless and honest, upright, winning, bland,

Meek in high place: I tinge his fortunes all,

Like waves their hue through ocean that expand. 
Perhaps 
vaá¹á¹aá¹
 is really for the Sanskrit 
vá¹á¹han
 meaning, increasing
.
 [3.168]


15. To friend or unfriend, better, like or worse,

Helper or foe, by dark or open day,

Whoso is kind, 
{3.263}
 without harsh word or curse,

I am his friend, living or dead, alway.


16. But if a fool have won some love from me,

And waxes proud and vain,

His froward path of wantonness I flee,

Like filthy stain.


17. Each manâs fortune and misfortune are his own work, not anotherâs:

Neither fortune nor misfortune can a man make for his brothers.â

After the lesson the Teacher identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the DevÄ« SirÄ« was Uppalavaá¹á¹Ä, the merchant SuciparivÄra was myself.â

## Full Story
âSomething strange today.â
 The Teacher told this tale while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning a monk who feared death. He was born in SÄvatthi of good family and was ordained in the dispensation: but he feared death and when he heard even a little moving of a bough, or falling of a stick or voice of bird or 
[3.181]
 beast or any such thing, he was frightened by the fear of death, and went away shaking like a hare wounded in the belly. The monks in the Dhamma Hall began to discuss, saying: âSirs, they say a certain monk, fearing death, runs away shaking when he hears even a little sound: now to beings in this world death is certain, life uncertain, and should not this be wisely borne in mind?â The Teacher found that this was their subject and that the monk admitted he was afraid of death, so he said: âMonks, he is not afraid of death for the first time,â and so he told a story of the past.

1. âSomething strange today I fear:

The trough is full, and mistress by;

Men, noose in hand, are standing near:

To eat appears a jeopardy.â

2. âYou fear, and look for aid, and quake,

But, helpless, whither can you flee?

Weâre fattened for our fleshâs sake:

Eat, Tuá¹á¸ila, and cheerfully.


3. Plunge bold into the crystal pool,

Wash all the stains of sweat away:

Youâll find our ointment wonderful,

Whose fragrance never can decay.â

4. âBut what is that fair crystal pool,

And what the stains of sweat, I pray?

And what the ointment wonderful,

Whose fragrance never can decay?â

5. âDhamma is the fair crystal pool,

Wrong is the stain of sweat, they say;

Virtueâs the ointment wonderful,

Whose fragrance never will decay.


6. Men that lose their life are glad,

Men that keep it feel annoy;

Men should die and not be sad,

As at mid-monthâs festal joy.â 
{3.292}

After the lesson, the Teacher declared the Truths and identified the JÄtaka, at the end of the Truths the monk who feared death was established in the fruition of the First Path, âIn those days the king was Änanda, Cullatuá¹á¸ila was the monk who fears death, the multitude was the Saá¹gha, MahÄtuá¹á¸ila myself.â

## Full Story
âGold-clawed creature.â
 The Teacher told this tale when dwelling in the Bamboo Grove, of Änandaâs dying for his sake. The occasion is told in the Khaá¹á¸ahÄlajÄtaka [Ja 542] about the hiring of bowmen, and in the Cullahaá¹sajÄtaka [Ja 533] 
[In fact both stories are told at Ja 533. I include them here.] 
 
[3.184]
 about the roar of the elephant DhanapÄla. 
See 
MilindapaÃ±ho,
 p. 207.

This was a story told by the Teacher, while dwelling in the Bamboo Grove, as to how the venerable Änanda renounced his life. For when archers were instigated to slay the TathÄgata, and the first one that was sent by Devadatta on this errand returned and said: âVenerable sir, I cannot deprive the Fortunate One of life: he is possessed of great supernatural powers,â Devadatta replied, âWell, sir, you need not slay the ascetic Gotama. I myself will deprive him of life.â And as the TathÄgata was walking in the shadow cast westward by the Vultureâs Peak, Devadatta climbed to the top of the mountain and hurled a mighty stone as if shot from a catapult, thinking: âWith this stone will I slay the ascetic Gotama,â but two mountain peaks meeting together intercepted the stone, and a splinter from it flew up and struck the Fortunate One on the foot and drew blood, and severe pains set in. JÄ«vaka, cutting open the TathÄgataâs foot with a knife, let out the bad blood and removed the proud flesh, and anointing the wound with medicine, healed it.


The Teacher moved about just as he did before, surrounded by his attendants, with all the great charm of a Buddha. So on seeing him Devadatta thought: âVerily no mortal beholding the excellent beauty of Gotamaâs person dare approach him, but the kingâs elephant NÄá¸·Ägiri is a fierce and savage animal and knows nothing of the virtues of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saá¹gha. He will bring about the destruction of the ascetic.â So he went and told the matter to the king. The king readily fell in with the suggestion, and, summoning his elephant-keeper, thus addressed him, âSir, tomorrow you are to make NÄá¸·Ägiri mad with drink, and at break of day to let him loose in the street where the ascetic Gotama walks.â And Devadatta asked the keeper how much arrack the elephant was wont to drink on ordinary days, and when he answered, âEight pots,â he said: âTomorrow give him sixteen pots to drink, and send him in the direction of the street frequented by the ascetic Gotama.â âVery good,â said the keeper. The king had a drum beaten throughout the city and proclaimed, âTomorrow NÄá¸·Ägiri will be maddened with strong drink and let loose in the city. The men of the city are to do all that they have to do in the early morning and after that no one is to venture out into the street.â


And Devadatta came down from the palace and went to the elephant stall and, addressing the keepers, said: âWe are able, I tell you, from a high position to degrade a man to a lowly one and to raise a man from a low position to a high one. If you are eager for honour, early tomorrow morning give NÄá¸·Ägiri sixteen pots of fiery liquor, and at the time when the ascetic Gotama comes that way, wound the elephant with spiked goads, and when in his fury he has broken down his stall, drive him in the direction of the street where Gotama is wont to walk, and so bring about the destruction of the ascetic.â They readily agreed to do so.


This rumour was noised abroad throughout the whole city. The lay disciples attached to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saá¹gha, on hearing it, drew near to the Teacher and said: âVenerable sir, Devadatta has conspired with the king and tomorrow he will have NÄá¸·Ägiri let loose in the street where you walk. Do not go into the city tomorrow for alms but remain here. We will provide food in the monastery for the monastics, with Buddha at their head.â The Teacher without directly saying: âI will not enter the city tomorrow for alms,â answered and said: âTomorrow I will work a miracle and tame NÄá¸·Ägiri and crush the heretics. And without going around for alms in RÄjagaha I will leave the city, attended by a company of the monks, and go straight to the Bamboo Grove, and the people of RÄjagaha shall repair there with many a bowl of food and tomorrow there shall be a meal provided in the refectory of the monastery.â In this way did the Teacher grant their request.


And on learning that the TathÄgata had acceded to their wishes, they set out from the city, carrying bowls of food, and saying: âWe will distribute our gifts in the monastery itself.â And the Teacher in the first watch taught the Dhamma, in the middle watch he solved hard questions, in the first part of the last watch he lay down lion-like on his right side, and the second part he spent in the Attainment of Fruition, in the third part, entering into a trance of deep pity for the sufferings of humanity, he contemplated all his kinsfolk that were ripe for conversion and seeing that as the result of his conquest of NÄá¸·Ägiri eighty-four thousand beings would be brought to a clear understanding of the Dhamma, at daybreak, after attending to his bodily necessities, he addressed Änanda and said: âÄnanda, today bid all the monks that are in the eighteen monasteries that are round about RÄjagaha to accompany me into the city.â The elder did so, and all the monks assembled at the Bamboo Grove.


The Teacher attended by a great company of monks entered RÄjagaha and the elephant-keepers proceeded according to their instructions and there was a great gathering of people. The believers thought: âToday there will be a mighty battle between the Buddha NÄga and this elephant NÄga of the brute world. We shall witness the defeat of NÄá¸·Ägiri by the incomparable skill of the Buddha,â and they climbed up and stood upon the upper storeys and roofs and house-tops. But the unbelieving heretics thought: âNÄá¸·Ägiri is a fierce, savage creature, and knows nothing of the merits of Buddhas and the like. Today he will crush the glorious form of the ascetic Gotama and bring about his death. Today we shall look upon the back of our enemy.â And they took their stand on upper storeys and other high places.


And the elephant, on seeing the Fortunate One approach him, terrified the people by demolishing the houses and raising his trunk he crushed the wagons into powder, and, with his ears and tail erect with excitement, he ran like some towering mountain in the direction of the Fortunate One. On seeing him the monks thus addressed the Fortunate One, âThis NÄá¸·Ägiri, venerable sir, a fierce and savage creature, and a slayer of men, is coming along this road. Of a truth he knows nothing of the merit of Buddhas and the like. Let the Fortunate One, the Auspicious One, withdraw.â âFear not, monks,â he said: âI am able to overcome NÄá¸·Ägiri.â Then the venerable SÄriputta prayed the Teacher, saying: âVenerable sir, when any service has to be rendered to a father, it is a burden laid on his eldest son. I will vanquish this creature.â Then the Teacher said: âSÄriputta, the power of a Buddha is one thing, that of his disciples is another,â and he rejected his offer, saying: âYou are to remain here.â This too was the prayer of the eighty chief elders for the most part, but he refused them all.


Then the venerable Änanda by reason of his strong affection for the Teacher was unable to acquiesce in this and cried, âLet this elephant kill me first,â and he stood before the Teacher, ready to sacrifice his life for the TathÄgata. So the Teacher said to him, âGo away, Änanda, do not stand in front of me.â The elder said: âVenerable sir, this elephant is fierce and savage, a slayer of men, like the flame at the beginning of a cycle. Let him first slay me and afterwards let him approach you.â And though he was spoken to for the third time, the elder remained in the same spot and did not retire. Then the Fortunate One by the exercise of his Supernormal Powers made him fall back and placed him in the midst of the monks.


At this moment a certain woman, catching sight of NÄá¸·Ägiri, was terrified with the fear of death, and as she fled she dropped her child, which she was carrying on her hip, between the TathÄgata and the elephant and made her escape. The elephant, pursuing the woman, came up to the child, who uttered a loud cry. The Teacher, having spread his special loving-kindness, and uttering the honeyed accents of a voice like that of Brahma, called to NÄá¸·Ägiri, saying: âHo! NÄá¸·Ägiri, those that maddened you with sixteen pots of arrack did not do this that you might attack someone else, but acted thus thinking you would attack me. Do not tire out your strength by rushing about aimlessly but come here.â


On hearing the voice of the Teacher he opened his eyes and beheld the glorious form of the Fortunate One, and he became greatly agitated and by the power of Buddha the intoxicating effects of the strong drink passed off. Dropping his trunk and shaking his ears he came and fell down at the feet of the TathÄgata. Then the Teacher addressing him said: âNÄá¸·Ägiri, you are a brute elephant, I am the Buddha elephant. Henceforth be not fierce and savage, nor a slayer of men, but cultivate thoughts of generosity.â So saying he stretched forth his right hand and coaxed the elephantâs forehead and taught the Dhamma to him in these words:

âThis elephant should you presume to assail,

An awful doom you would erelong bewail.


To strike this elephant would destine you

To state of suffering in worlds to be.


From mad and foolish recklessness abstain,

The reckless fool to heaven will neâer attain.


If in the next world you would win heavenâs bliss,

See that you do what is right in this.â

The whole body of the elephant constantly thrilled with joy, and had he not been a mere animal, he would have entered on the fruition of the First Path. The people, on beholding this miracle, shouted and snapped their fingers. In their joy they cast upon him all manner of ornaments and covered therewith all the body of the elephant. Thenceforth NÄá¸·Ägiri was known as DhanapÄlaka (keeper of treasure).


Now on the occasion of this encounter with DhanapÄlaka eighty-four thousand beings drank the nectar of immortality. And the Teacher established DhanapÄlaka in the Five Precepts. With his trunk taking up dust from the feet of the Fortunate One the elephant sprinkled it on his head, and retiring with bent body he stood bowing to the One with Ten Powers as long as he was in sight, and then he turned and entered the elephant stall. Thenceforth he was quite tame and harmed no man.


The Teacher, now that his desire was fulfilled, decided that the treasure should remain the property of those by whom it had been thrown upon the elephant and thinking: âToday I have wrought a great miracle. It is not seemly that I should go my rounds for alms in this city,â and after crushing the heretics, surrounded by a band of the monks, he sallied forth from the city like a victorious warrior chief and made straight for the Bamboo Grove. The citizens, taking with them a quantity of boiled rice, drink, and some solid food, went to the monastery and gave an almsgiving on a grand scale.

Then they began a discussion in the Dhamma Hall, âSirs, has the elder Änanda, Treasurer of the Dhamma, who attained to the analytic knowledges of one still in training, given up his life for the Perfect Buddha when DhanapÄla came?â The Teacher came and was told the subject of their discussion: he said: âMonk, in former times also Änanda gave up his life for me,â and so he told a story of the past.

1. âGold-clawed creature with projecting eyes,

Lake-bred, hairless, clad in bony shell,

He has caught me: hear my woeful cries!

Why do you leave a mate that loves you well?â

2. âThe snake fell on the crab amain, his friend heâd not forsake:

Puffing his mighty hood he came: but the crab turned on the snake.â

3. â âTis not for the sake of food

Crabs would seize a snake or crow:

Tell me, you whose eyes protrude,

Why you take and grip us so?â

4. âThis man took me from the pool,

Great the kindness he has done;

If he dies, my grief is full:

Serpent, he and I are one.


5. Seeing I am grown so great

All would kill me willingly:

Fat and sweet and delicate,

Crows at sight would injure me!â 
{3.297}

6. âIf you have seized us only for his sake,

Iâll take the poison from him: let him rise.

Quick! From the crow and me your pincers take;

Till then the poisonâs sinking deep, he dies.â

7. âIâll free the snake, but not the crow;

The crow shall be a hostage bound:

Never shall I let him go

Till my friend be safe and sound.â

The lesson ended, the Teacher declared the Truths, and identifying the JÄtaka spoke the last verse:

8. âMÄra, was the dusky serpent, Devadatta was the crow,

Good Änanda was the crab, and I the brahmin long ago.â

At the end of the Truths many reached the First Path and the other Paths. The female crow was CiÃ±camÄá¹avikÄ, though this is not mentioned in the last verse.

In the present one miserly merchant dies and the king inherits his wealth, and asks the Buddha why he was so rich on the one hand, and so miserly on the other. The Buddha first tells a story of how in a previous life he had given to a Paccekabuddha, but had later regretted it. Then the Buddha tells another story in which a brother killed his adopted son in order to gain his inheritance, and he was reproved by the boyâs father, and mended his ways.

âDid we joy.â
 
{3.299}
 The Teacher told this while dwelling in Jetavana, of a stranger merchant. There was in SÄvatthi a stranger merchant, rich and of great substance: he did not enjoy his wealth himself nor give it to others: if choice food of fine flavours was served he would not eat it, eating only broth of 
[3.187]
 rice-dust with sour gruel; if silken clothes perfumed with incense were brought him he had them removed, and wore clothes of coarse hair-cloth; if a chariot adorned with jewels and gold and drawn by high-bred horses were brought him, he had it taken away and went in a broken-down old chariot with a parasol of leaves overhead.


All his life he did nothing with gifts or the other merits, and when he died he was born in the hell Roruva. His substance was heirless, and the kingâs men carried it into the palace in seven days and nights. After it was carried in, the king went after breakfast to Jetavana, and saluted the Teacher. When he was asked why he did not wait regularly on Buddha, he answered, âLord, a stranger merchant has died at SÄvatthi, seven days have been spent in carrying his wealth, to which he left no heir, into my house, but though he had all that wealth he neither enjoyed it himself nor gave it to others, his wealth was like lotus-tanks guarded by Yakkhas. One day he fell into the jaws of death after refusing to enjoy the flavour of choice meats and the like. Now why did that selfish and undeserving man gain all that wealth, and for what reason did he not incline his thoughts to the enjoyment of it?â This was the question he put to the Teacher. âGreat king, the reason why he gained his wealth and yet did not enjoy it, was this,â and so at his request the Teacher told a story of the past.

Did we joy to feel the wish to give,

Give the gift, and give it cheerfully,

Neâer regret the giving while we live,

Children born of us would never die. [Ja 447]


Joy before the bountyâs given, giving cheerfully,

Pleasure at the thought thereafter, that is perfect generosity. [AN 6.37, Pv 305]

1. âThere is a bird called Mayhaka, in mountain cave it lives:

On pipal trees with ripening fruit, âMine, mine,â the cry it gives. 
{3.302}


2. The other birds, while thus he plains, in flocks about him fly:

They eat the fruit, but still goes on the Mayhaâs plaintive cry.


3. And even so a single man enormous wealth may win,

And yet may not divide it fair between himself and kin.


4. Not once enjoyment does he reap, of raiment or of food,

Of perfumes or flower garlands; nor does his kinsfolk good.


5. âMine, mine,â he whimpers as he guards his treasures greedily:

But kings, or robbers, or his heirs that wish to see him die

Pillage his wealth: yet still goes on the miserâs plaintive cry.


6. A wise man, gaining riches great, is helpful to his kin:

âTis thus heâll win repute on earth and heaven hereafter win.â 
{3.303}

After the lesson, the Teacher said: âSo, great king, the stranger merchant had neither son nor daughter for all that time because he killed his brotherâs son,â and then he identified the JÄtaka, âThe younger brother was the stranger merchant, the elder was myself.â

âNoble of face.â
 
[3.189]
 The Teacher told this while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning his going about for the whole worldâs good. The occasion will appear in the MahÄkaá¹hajÄtaka [Ja 469].

One day, they say, the monks as they sat in the Dhamma Hall, were talking together. âSirs,â one would say, âthe Teacher, ever practising friendship towards the multitudes of the people, has forsaken an agreeable abode, and lives just for the good of the world. He has attained supreme wisdom, yet of his own accord takes bowl and robe, and goes on a journey of eighteen leagues or more. For the five elders he set rolling the Wheel of the Dhamma; on the fifth day of the half-month he recited the Anattalakkhaá¹a discourse, and made them Arahats; he went to Uruveá¸·a, and to the ascetics with matted hair he showed three and a half thousand miracles, and persuaded them to join the Saá¹gha; at GayÄsÄ«sa he taught the Discourse upon Fire, and made a thousand of these ascetics Arahats; to MahÄkassapa, when he had gone forward three miles to meet him, after three discourses he gave the higher ordination; all alone, after the noon-day meal, he went a journey of forty-five leagues, and then established in the Fruit of the Third Path Pukkusa (a youth of very good birth); to meet MahÄkappina he went forward a space of two thousand leagues, and made him an Arahat; alone, in the afternoon he went a journey of thirty leagues, and made that cruel and harsh man Aá¹gulimÄla an Arahat; thirty leagues also he traversed, and established Äá¸·avaka in the Fruit of the First Path, and saved the prince; in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three he dwelt three months, and taught Abhidhamma to eight hundred millions of deities; to the Brahma Realm he went, and destroyed the false Dhamma of Baka Brahma, and made ten thousand Brahmas Arahats; every year he goes on pilgrimage in three districts, and to such men as are capable of receiving, he gives the Refuges, the Precepts, and the Fruits of the different stages; he even acts for the good of NÄgas and Garuá¸·as and the like, in many ways.â


In such words they praised the goodness and worth of the One with Ten Powersâ life for the good of the world. The Teacher came in, and asked what they talked about as they sat there? They told him.

Then the Teacher said: âMonks, this is not the first time the TathÄgata has gone about for the worldâs good,â and so told a story of the past.

1. âNoble of face, you make obeisance low;

Behind one mean and poor to sight you go:

Is he your better or your equal, say,

Declare to us your name and his, we pray.â

2. âGods do not tell the lineage and the name

Of saints devout and perfect in the way;

As for myself, my title I proclaim,

Sakka, the lord whom thirty gods obey.â

3. âHe who beholds the saint of perfect merits,

And walks behind him with obeisance low; 
{3.306}

I ask, O king of gods, what he inherits,

What blessings will another life bestow?â

4. âHe who beholds the saint of perfect merits,

Who walks behind him with obeisance low:

Great praise from men in this world he inherits,

And death to him the path of heaven will show.â

5. âOh, fortuneâs sun on me today does rise,

Our eyes have seen your majesty divine:

Your saint appears, O Sakka, to our eyes,

And many a virtuous deed will now be mine.â

6. âSurely âtis good to venerate the wise,

To knowledge who their learned thoughts incline:

Now that the saint and I have met thine eyes,

O king, let many a virtuous deed be thine.â 
{3.307}

7. âFrom anger free, with grace in every thought,

Iâll lend an ear whenever strangers sue:

I take your counsel good, I bring to nought

My pride and serve you, Lord, with homage due.â

After the lesson, the Teacher declared the Truths and identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the Paccekabuddha reached NibbÄna, the king was Änanda, Sakka was myself.â

âYou were never.â
 The Teacher told this tale while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning a certain monk. The story is that the monk had left Jetavana and dwelt in the Kosala kingdom near a certain wood: one day he went down into a lotus-pool, 
{3.308}
 and seeing a lotus in flower he stood to leeward and smelt 
[3.192]
 it. Then the DevatÄ who dwelt in that part of the forest frightened him saying: âSir, you are a thief of odours, this is a kind of theft.â He went back in a fright to Jetavana, and saluted the Teacher and sat down. âWhere have you been staying, monk?â âIn such and such a wood, and the DevatÄ frightened me in such and such a way.â The Teacher said: âYou are not the first who have been frightened by a DevatÄ when smelling a flower; sages of old have been frightened in like manner,â and at the monkâs request he told a story of the past.

1. âYou were never given that flower you smell, though itâs only a single bloom;

âTis a species of larceny, venerable sir, you are stealing its perfume.â

2. âI neither take nor break the flower: from afar I smell the bloom.

I cannot tell on what pretence you say I steal perfume.â

3. âA man who digs the lotus-roots and breaks the stalks I see:

Why donât you call the conduct of that man disorderly?â

4. âDisgusting like a nurseâs dress are men disorderly:

I have no speech with men like him, but I deign to speak to you.


5. When a man is free from evil stains and seeks for purity,

A wrong like a hair-tip shows on him like a dark cloud in the sky.â

 The Teacher told this tale while dwelling in the East Garden, concerning some monks who were given to amusement. The great MoggallÄna had shaken their dwelling and alarmed them. The monks sat discussing their fault in the Dhamma Hall. The Teacher being told this said to them, âThey are not given to amusement for the first time,â and so told a story of the past.

1. âHappy life is theirs who live on remnants left from generosity:

Praise in this world is their lot, and in the next felicity.â

2. âShould not wise men listen when a parrot speaks in human tongue:

Hearken, monks: âtis our praises clearly that this bird has sung.â

Tell me then what is the reason of your leanness, master crow.â

2. âI dwell in midst of many foes, my heart goes pit-a-pat

4. Rude grass and seeds are all your food, thereâs little richness there;

Then tell me why youâre fat, good quail, on such a scanty fare.â

5. âI have content and easy mind, short distances to go,

I live on anything I get, and so Iâm fat, good crow.

 The Teacher told this tale while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning a greedy monk. The occasion is as above. 
[I include the following from the parallel story at Ja 42 
KapotajÄtaka
.]

This story the Teacher dwelling at Jetavana told concerning a greedy monk. He was, it was said, greedy after the Buddhist requisites and casting off all duties of master and pastor, entered SÄvatthi quite early, and after drinking excellent rice-gruel served with many a kind of solid food in the house of VisÄkhÄ, and after eating in the daytime various dainties, paddy, meat and boiled rice, not satisfied with this he went about thence to the house of Culla AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika, and the king of Kosala, and various others.


But on this occasion the monks told the Teacher, saying: âSir, this monk is greedy.â Said the Teacher, âIs it true as they say, monk, that you are greedy?â âYes, sir,â was the reply.âSo too in bygone days, monk, you were greedy, and by reason of your greediness lost your life; also you caused the wise and good to lose their home.â And so saying he told this story of the past.

1. âOur old friend! Look at him!

A jewel bright he wears;

His beard in gallant trim,

How good our friend appears!â 
{3.315}

2. âMy nails and hair had grown so fast,

They hampered me in all I did:

A barber came along at last,

And of superfluous hair Iâm rid.â

3. âGranted you got a barber then,

Who has cropped your hair so well:

Round your neck, will you explain,

Whatâs that tinkling like a bell?â

4. âMen of fashion wear a gem

Round the neck, itâs often done;

I am imitating them,

Donât suppose itâs just for fun.


5. If youâre really envious

Of my beard thatâs trimmed so true:

I can get you barbered thus;

You may have the jewel too.â

6. âNay, âtis you they best become,

Gem and beard thatâs trimmed so true.

I find your presence troublesome;

I go with a good-day to you.â 
{3.316}

After the lesson, the Teacher declared the Truths and identified the JÄtaka, After the Truths, the greedy monk was established in the fruition of the Third Path. âAt that time the crow was the greedy monk, the pigeon was myself.â

This story the Teacher, while dwelling at Jetavana, told by way of admonition to the king of Kosala. Now this king came to hear the preaching of the Dhamma and the Teacher addressed him in the following terms, âA king, sire, ought to rule his kingdom righteously, for whenever kings are unrighteous, then also are his officers unrighteous.â And admonishing him in the right way as related in the CatukkanipÄta [Ja 334] he pointed out the suffering and the blessing involved in following or abstaining from evil courses, and expounded in detail the misery resulting from sensual pleasures, comparing them to dreams and the like, saying: âIn the case of these men,

No bribe can move relentless death, no kindness mollify,

No one in fight can vanquish death. For all are doomed to die.

And when they depart to another world, except their own virtuous action they have no other sure refuge, so that they must inevitably forsake low associations, and for their reputationâs sake they must not be careless, but be earnest and exercise rule in righteousness, even as kings of old, before Buddha arose, abiding in the admonition of the wise, ruled righteously and departing attained to the heavenly city,â and at the request of the king he told a story of the past.

1. âThe peakâs a cubit and a half in height,

Eight spans will compass it in circuit round,

Of siá¹sapa and sÄra built aright;

Why does it stand so sound?â

Set equally, encompass it around,

They press it tightly, for their hold is good;

âTis set aright and sound. 
[3.198]


3. So is the wise man, girt by faithful friends,

By steadfast counsellors and pure;

Never from height of fortune he descends,

As rafters hold the peak secure.â

4. âThe rough-skinned citron bitter is to eat,

If it remain untouched by carverâs steel;

You spoil the sweetness if you add the peel.

Gathers kingâs dues in village and in town,

Increases wealth, and yet gives no offence;

He walks the way of right and of renown.â 
{3.320}

6. âLike the lotus in the pool,

White roots, waters pure, sustain it;

In the sunâs face flowering full,

Dust nor mud nor wet can stain it.

Meek and pure and good we style him;

Like the lotus in the pool

Stain of wrong cannot defile him.â

âThe bow is bent.â
 
[3.199]
 The Teacher told this while dwelling in the Bamboo Grove, concerning a monk who kept bad company. The occasion was given at length in the MahilÄmukhatajÄtaka [Ja 26].

This story was told by the Teacher while at the Bamboo Grove, about Devadatta, who, having secured the adherence of prince AjÄtasattu, had attained both gain and honour. Prince AjÄtasattu had a monastery built for Devadatta at GayÄsÄ«sa, and every day brought to him five hundred pots of perfumed three-year-old rice flavoured with all the choicest flavourings. All this gain and honour brought Devadatta a great following, with whom Devadatta lived on, without ever stirring out of his monastery.


At that time there were living in RÄjagaha two friends, of whom one had taken the vows under the Teacher, while the other had taken them under Devadatta. And these continued to see one another, either casually or by visiting the monasteries. Now one day the disciple of Devadatta said to the other, âSir, why do you daily go round for alms with the sweat streaming off you? Devadatta sits quietly at GayÄsÄ«sa and feeds on the best of fare, flavoured with all the choicest flavourings. Thereâs no way like his. Why create misery for yourself? Why should it not be a good thing for you to come the first thing in the morning to the monastery at GayÄsÄ«sa and there drink our rice-gruel with a relish after it, try our eighteen kinds of solid victuals, and enjoy our excellent soft food, flavoured with all the choicest flavourings?â


Being pressed time after time to accept the invitation, the other began to want to go, and thenceforth used to go to GayÄsÄ«sa and there eat and eat, not forgetting however to return to the Bamboo Grove at the proper hour. Nevertheless he could not keep it secret always; and in a little while it came out that he used to go to GayÄsÄ«sa and there regale himself with the food provided for Devadatta. Accordingly, his friends asked him, saying: âIs it true, as they say, that you regale yourself on the food provided for Devadatta?â âWho said that?â said he. âSo-and-so said it.â âIt is true, sirs, that I go to GayÄsÄ«sa and eat there. But it is not Devadatta who gives me food; others do that.â âSir, Devadatta is the foe of the Buddhas; in his wickedness, he has secured the adherence of AjÄtasattu and by unrighteousness got gain and honour for himself. Yet you who have taken the vows according to this dispensation which leads to safety, eat the food which Devadatta gets by unrighteousness. Come; let us bring you before the Teacher.â And, taking with them the monk, they went to the Dhamma Hall.


When the Teacher became aware of their presence, he said: âMonks, are you bringing this monk here against his will?â âYes, sir; this monk, after taking the vows under you, eats the food which Devadatta gets by unrighteousness.â

The Teacher said: âMonks, he is not keeping bad company for the first time,â and told a story of the past.

1. âThe bow is bent, the bowstring sounds amain;

Manoja, king of beasts, my friend, is slain.


2. Alas, I seek the woods as best I may;

Such friendshipâs naught; others must be my stay.â

3. âHis fortune is not prosperous whom wicked folk entice;

Look at Manoja lying there, through Giriyaâs advice.


4. No joy have mothers in a son whose comrades are not good;

Look at Manoja lying there all covered with his blood.


5. And even so fares still the man, in low estate he lies,

Who follows not the counsel of the true friend and the wise.


6. This, or worse than this, his fate

Who is high, but trusts the low; 
{3.324}

See, âtis thus from kingly state

He has fallen to the bow.â

7. âWho follows outcastes is himself out cast,

Who courts his equals neâer will be betrayed,

Who bows before the noblest rises fast;

Look therefore to your betters for thine aid.â

After the lesson, the Teacher declared the Truths and identified the JÄtaka, After the Truths the monk who kept bad company was established in the fruition of the First Path. âAt that time the jackal was Devadatta, Manoja was the keeper of bad company, his sister was Uppalavaá¹nÄ, his wife the nun KhemÄ, his mother the mother of RÄhula, his father myself.â

âThe king has sent.â
 
[3.201]
 The Teacher told this tale while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning a monk who supported his mother. The occasion will appear in the SÄmajÄtaka [Ja 540].

They say that there was a wealthy merchant at SÄvatthi, who was worth eighteen crores; and he had a son who was very dear and winning to his father and mother. One day the youth went upon the terrace of the house, and opened a window and looked down on the street; and when he saw the great crowd going to Jetavana with perfumes and garlands in their hands to hear the Dhamma preached, he exclaimed that he would go too.


So having ordered perfumes and garlands to be brought, he went to the monastery, and having distributed robes, medicines, drinks, etc. to the assembly and honoured the Fortunate One with perfumes and garlands, he sat down on one side. After hearing the Dhamma, and perceiving the evil consequences of desire and the blessings arising from adopting the ascetic life, when the assembly broke up he asked the Fortunate One for ordination, but he was told that the TathÄgatas do not ordain anyone who has not obtained the permission of his parents; so he went away, and lived a week without food, and having at last obtained his parentsâ consent, he returned and begged for ordination. The Teacher sent a monk who ordained him; and after he was ordained he obtained great honour and gain; he won the favour of his teachers and preceptors, and having received full orders he mastered the Dhamma in five years.


Then he thought to himself, âI live here distracted â it is not suitable for me,â and he became anxious to reach the goal of spiritual insight; so having obtained instruction in meditation from his teacher, he departed to a frontier village and dwelt in the forest, and there having entered a course of insight, however much he laboured and strove for twelve years, he failed to attain any special insight.


His parents also, as time went on, became poor, for those who hired their land or carried on merchandise for them, finding out that there was no son or brother in the family to enforce the payment, seized what they could lay their hands upon and ran away as they pleased, and the servants and labourers in the house seized the gold and coin and made off therewith, so that at the end the two were reduced to an evil plight and had not even a jug for pouring water; and at last they sold their dwelling, and finding themselves homeless, and in extreme misery, they wandered begging for alms, clothed in rags and carrying potsherds in their hands.


Now at that time a monk came from Jetavana to the sonâs place of abode; he performed the duties of hospitality and, as he sat quietly, he first asked whence he was come; and learning that he was come from Jetavana he asked after the health of the Teacher and the principal disciples and then asked for news of his parents, âTell me, sir, about the welfare of such and such a merchantâs family in SÄvatthi.â âO friend, donât ask for news of that family.â âWhy not, sir?â âThey say that there was one son in that family, but he has become an ascetic in this dispensation, and since he left the world that family has gone to ruin; and at the present time the two old people are reduced to a most lamentable state and beg for alms.â


When he heard the otherâs words he could not remain unmoved, but began to weep with his eyes full of tears, and when the other asked him why he wept, âO sir,â he replied, âthey are my own father and mother, I am their son.â âO friend, your father and mother have come to ruin through you â do you go and take care of them.â âFor twelve years,â he thought to himself, âI have laboured and striven but never been able to attain the Path or the Fruit; I must be incompetent; what have I to do with the ascetic life? I will become a householder and will support my parents and give away my wealth, and will thus eventually become destined for heaven.â


So having determined he gave up his abode in the forest to the elder, and the next day departed and by successive stages reached the monastery at the back of Jetavana which is not far from SÄvatthi. There he found two roads, one leading to Jetavana, the other to SÄvatthi. As he stood there, he thought: âShall I see my parents first or the One with Ten Powers?â Then he said to himself, âIn old days I saw my parents for a long time, from henceforth I shall rarely have the chance of seeing the Buddha; I will see the Fully Awakened One today and hear the Dhamma, and then tomorrow morning I will see my parents.â So he left the road to SÄvatthi and in the evening arrived at Jetavana.


Now that very day at daybreak, the Teacher, as he looked upon the world, had seen the potentialities of this young man, and when he came to visit him he praised the virtues of parents in the MÄtiposakasutta [SN 7.19]. As he stood at the end of the assembly of elders and listened, he thought: âIf I become a householder I can support my parents; but the Teacher also says, âA son who has become an ascetic can be helpful,â I went away before without seeing the Teacher, and I failed in such an imperfect ordination; I will now support my parents while still remaining an ascetic without becoming a householder.â So he took his ticket and his ticket-food and gruel, and felt as if he had committed a wrong deserving expulsion after a solitary abode of twelve years in the forest. In the morning he went to SÄvatthi and he thought to himself, âShall I first get the gruel or see my parents?â He reflected that it would not be right to visit them in their poverty empty-handed; so he first got the gruel and then went to the door of their old house.


When he saw them sitting by the opposite wall after having gone their round for the alms given in broth, he stood not far from them in a sudden burst of sorrow with his eyes full of tears. They saw him but knew him not; then his mother, thinking that it was someone standing for alms, said to him, âWe have nothing fit to be given to you, be pleased to pass on.â When he heard her, he repressed the grief which filled his heart and remained still standing as before with his eyes full of tears, and when he was addressed a second and a third time he still continued standing.


At last the father said to the mother, âGo to him; can this be your son?â She rose and went to him and, recognising him, fell at his feet and lamented, and the father also joined his lamentations, and there was a loud outburst of sorrow. To see his parents he could not control himself, but burst into tears; then, after yielding to his feelings, he said: âDo not grieve, I will support you,â so having comforted them and made them drink some gruel, and sit down on one side, he went again and begged for some food and gave it to them, and then went and asked for alms for himself, and having finished his meal, took up his abode at a short distance off.


From that day forward he watched over his parents in this manner; he gave them all the alms he received for himself, even those at the fortnightly distributions, and he went on separate expeditions for his own alms, and ate them; and whatever food he received as provision for the rainy season he gave to them, while he took their worn-out garments and dyed them with the doors fast closed and used them himself; but the days were few when he gained alms and there were many when he failed to win anything, and his inner and outer clothing became very rough.


As he watched over his parents he gradually grew very pale and thin and his friends and intimates said to him, âYour complexion used to be bright, but now you have become very pale â has some illness come upon you?â He replied, âNo illness has come upon me, but a hindrance has befallen me,â and he told them the history. âSir,â they replied, âthe Teacher does not allow us to waste the offerings of the faithful, you do an unlawful act in giving to laymen the offerings of the faithful.â When he heard this he shrank away ashamed.


But not satisfied with this they went and told it to the Teacher, saying: âSo and so, sir, has wasted the offerings of the faithful and used them to feed laymen.â The Teacher sent for the young man of family and said to him, âIs it true that you, an ascetic, take the offerings of the faithful and support laymen with them?â He confessed that it was true. Then the Teacher, wishing to praise what he had done and to declare an old action of his own, said: âWhen you support laymen whom do you support?â âMy parents,â he answered. Then the Teacher, wishing to encourage him still more said: âWell done, well done,â three times, âYou are in a path which I have traversed before you; I in old time, while going the round for alms, supported my parents.â The ascetic was encouraged thereby. At the request of the monks the Teacher, to make known his former actions, told them a story of the past.

âHow will the old folks.â
 
[3.204]
 The Teacher told this when dwelling in Jetavana, concerning a monk who supported his mother.

They say that there was a wealthy merchant at SÄvatthi, who was worth eighteen crores; and he had a son who was very dear and winning to his father and mother. One day the youth went upon the terrace of the house, and opened a window and looked down on the street; and when he saw the great crowd going to Jetavana with perfumes and garlands in their hands to hear the Dhamma preached, he exclaimed that he would go too.


So having ordered perfumes and garlands to be brought, he went to the monastery, and having distributed robes, medicines, drinks, etc. to the assembly and honoured the Fortunate One with perfumes and garlands, he sat down on one side. After hearing the Dhamma, and perceiving the evil consequences of desire and the blessings arising from adopting the ascetic life, when the assembly broke up he asked the Fortunate One for ordination, but he was told that the TathÄgatas do not ordain anyone who has not obtained the permission of his parents; so he went away, and lived a week without food, and having at last obtained his parentsâ consent, he returned and begged for ordination. The Teacher sent a monk who ordained him; and after he was ordained he obtained great honour and gain; he won the favour of his teachers and preceptors, and having received full orders he mastered the Dhamma in five years.


Then he thought to himself, âI live here distracted â it is not suitable for me,â and he became anxious to reach the goal of spiritual insight; so having obtained instruction in meditation from his teacher, he departed to a frontier village and dwelt in the forest, and there having entered a course of insight, however much he laboured and strove for twelve years, he failed to attain any special insight.


His parents also, as time went on, became poor, for those who hired their land or carried on merchandise for them, finding out that there was no son or brother in the family to enforce the payment, seized what they could lay their hands upon and ran away as they pleased, and the servants and labourers in the house seized the gold and coin and made off therewith, so that at the end the two were reduced to an evil plight and had not even a jug for pouring water; and at last they sold their dwelling, and finding themselves homeless, and in extreme misery, they wandered begging for alms, clothed in rags and carrying potsherds in their hands.


Now at that time a monk came from Jetavana to the sonâs place of abode; he performed the duties of hospitality and, as he sat quietly, he first asked whence he was come; and learning that he was come from Jetavana he asked after the health of the Teacher and the principal disciples and then asked for news of his parents, âTell me, sir, about the welfare of such and such a merchantâs family in SÄvatthi.â âO friend, donât ask for news of that family.â âWhy not, sir?â âThey say that there was one son in that family, but he has become an ascetic in this dispensation, and since he left the world that family has gone to ruin; and at the present time the two old people are reduced to a most lamentable state and beg for alms.â


When he heard the otherâs words he could not remain unmoved, but began to weep with his eyes full of tears, and when the other asked him why he wept, âO sir,â he replied, âthey are my own father and mother, I am their son.â âO friend, your father and mother have come to ruin through you â do you go and take care of them.â âFor twelve years,â he thought to himself, âI have laboured and striven but never been able to attain the Path or the Fruit; I must be incompetent; what have I to do with the ascetic life? I will become a householder and will support my parents and give away my wealth, and will thus eventually become destined for heaven.â


So having determined he gave up his abode in the forest to the elder, and the next day departed and by successive stages reached the monastery at the back of Jetavana which is not far from SÄvatthi. There he found two roads, one leading to Jetavana, the other to SÄvatthi. As he stood there, he thought: âShall I see my parents first or the One with Ten Powers?â Then he said to himself, âIn old days I saw my parents for a long time, from henceforth I shall rarely have the chance of seeing the Buddha; I will see the Fully Awakened One today and hear the Dhamma, and then tomorrow morning I will see my parents.â So he left the road to SÄvatthi and in the evening arrived at Jetavana.


Now that very day at daybreak, the Teacher, as he looked upon the world, had seen the potentialities of this young man, and when he came to visit him he praised the virtues of parents in the MÄtiposakasutta [SN 7.19]. As he stood at the end of the assembly of elders and listened, he thought: âIf I become a householder I can support my parents; but the Teacher also says, âA son who has become an ascetic can be helpful,â I went away before without seeing the Teacher, and I failed in such an imperfect ordination; I will now support my parents while still remaining an ascetic without becoming a householder.â So he took his ticket and his ticket-food and gruel, and felt as if he had committed a wrong deserving expulsion after a solitary abode of twelve years in the forest. In the morning he went to SÄvatthi and he thought to himself, âShall I first get the gruel or see my parents?â He reflected that it would not be right to visit them in their poverty empty-handed; so he first got the gruel and then went to the door of their old house.


When he saw them sitting by the opposite wall after having gone their round for the alms given in broth, he stood not far from them in a sudden burst of sorrow with his eyes full of tears. They saw him but knew him not; then his mother, thinking that it was someone standing for alms, said to him, âWe have nothing fit to be given to you, be pleased to pass on.â When he heard her, he repressed the grief which filled his heart and remained still standing as before with his eyes full of tears, and when he was addressed a second and a third time he still continued standing.


At last the father said to the mother, âGo to him; can this be your son?â She rose and went to him and, recognising him, fell at his feet and lamented, and the father also joined his lamentations, and there was a loud outburst of sorrow. To see his parents he could not control himself, but burst into tears; then, after yielding to his feelings, he said: âDo not grieve, I will support you,â so having comforted them and made them drink some gruel, and sit down on one side, he went again and begged for some food and gave it to them, and then went and asked for alms for himself, and having finished his meal, took up his abode at a short distance off.


From that day forward he watched over his parents in this manner; he gave them all the alms he received for himself, even those at the fortnightly distributions, and he went on separate expeditions for his own alms, and ate them; and whatever food he received as provision for the rainy season he gave to them, while he took their worn-out garments and dyed them with the doors fast closed and used them himself; but the days were few when he gained alms and there were many when he failed to win anything, and his inner and outer clothing became very rough.


As he watched over his parents he gradually grew very pale and thin and his friends and intimates said to him, âYour complexion used to be bright, but now you have become very pale â has some illness come upon you?â He replied, âNo illness has come upon me, but a hindrance has befallen me,â and he told them the history. âSir,â they replied, âthe Teacher does not allow us to waste the offerings of the faithful, you do an unlawful act in giving to laymen the offerings of the faithful.â When he heard this he shrank away ashamed.


But not satisfied with this they went and told it to the Teacher, saying: âSo and so, sir, has wasted the offerings of the faithful and used them to feed laymen.â The Teacher sent for the young man of family and said to him, âIs it true that you, an ascetic, take the offerings of the faithful and support laymen with them?â He confessed that it was true. Then the Teacher, wishing to praise what he had done and to declare an old action of his own, said: âWhen you support laymen whom do you support?â âMy parents,â he answered. Then the Teacher, wishing to encourage him still more said: âWell done, well done,â three times, âYou are in a path which I have traversed before you; I in old time, while going the round for alms, supported my parents.â The ascetic was encouraged thereby. At the request of the monks the Teacher, to make known his former actions, told them a story of the past.

1. âHow will the old folks manage now within the mountain cave?

For I am fastened in a snare, cruel NilÄ«yaâs slave.â 
{3.331}

2. âVulture, what strange laments of yours are these my ears that reach?

I never heard or saw a bird that uttered human speech.â


3. âI tend my aged parents within a mountain cave,

How will the old folks manage now that Iâve become your slave?â


4. âCarrion a vulture sights across a hundred leagues of land;

Why do you fail to see a snare and net so close at hand?â


5. âWhen ruin comes upon a man, and fates his death demand,

He fails to see a snare or net although so close at hand.â


6. âGo, tend your aged parents within their mountain cave,

Go, visit them in peace, you have from me the leave you crave.â


7. âO hunter, happiness be thine, with all your kith and kin;

Iâll tend my aged parents their mountain cave within.â

After the lesson, the Teacher declared the Truths and identified the JÄtaka, After the Truths, the monk was established in the fruition of the First Path. 
{3.332}
 âAt that time, the hunter was Channa, the parents were kingâs kin, the vulture-king myself.â

## Full Story
âFriend AnutÄ«racÄrÄ«.â
 
[3.205]
 The Teacher told this while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning Upananda, of the Sakya tribe. He was ordained in the dispensation, but forsook the virtues of contentment and the rest and became very greedy. At the beginning of the Rains Retreat he tried two or three monasteries, leaving at one an umbrella or a shoe, at one a walking-stick or a waterpot, and dwelling in one himself. He began the Rains Retreat in a country monastery, and saying: âThe monks must live contentedly,â explained to the monks, as if he were making the moon rise in the sky, the way to the noble state of content, praising contentment with the necessaries. Hearing him the monks threw away their pleasant robes and vessels, and took pots of clay and robes of dust-rags. He put the others in his own lodging, and when the Rains Retreat and the Invitation festival were over he filled a cart and went to Jetavana.


On the way, behind a monastery in the forest, wrapping his feet with creepers and saying: âSurely something can be got here,â he entered the monastery. Two old monks had spent the Rains Retreat there; they had got two coarse cloaks and one fine blanket, and, as they could not divide them, they were pleased to see him, thinking: âThis elder will divide these between us,â and said: âSir, we cannot divide this which is raiment for the Rains Retreat; we have a dispute about it, do you divide it between us.â He consented and giving the two coarse cloaks to them he took the blanket, saying: âThis falls to me who know the rules of discipline,â and went away.


These elders, who loved the blanket, went with him to Jetavana, and told the matter to the monks who knew the rules, saying: âIs it right for those who know the rules to devour plunder thus?â The monks seeing the pile of robes and bowls brought by the elder Upananda, said: âSir, you have great merit, you have gained much food and raiment.â He said: âSirs, where is my merit? I gained this in such and such a manner,â telling them all.


In the Dhamma Hall they raised a talk, saying: âSirs, Upananda, of the Sakya tribe, is very covetous and greedy.â 
{3.333}
 The Teacher, finding their subject, said: âMonks, Upanandaâs deeds are not suited for progress; when a monk explains progress to another he should first act suitably himself and then preach to others.â

Yourself first establish in propriety,

Then teach; the wise should not self-seeking be. [Dhp. 158]

By this verse of the Dhammapada he showed the Dhamma and said: âMonks, Upananda is not covetous for the first time; he was so before and he plundered menâs property before,â and so he told a story of the past.

1. âFriend AnutÄ«racÄrÄ«, rush to my aid, I pray;

Iâve caught a great fish; but by force heâs carrying me away.â 
{3.334}

2. âGambhÄ«racÄrÄ«, luck to you! Your grip be firm and stout,

As Supaá¹á¹a would lift a snake, Iâll lift the fellow out.â

3. âA strife arose between us, mark! O you of grassy hue,

Let our contention, honoured sir, be settled fair by you.â

4. âIâve arbitrated many a case and done it peacefully;

Let your contention, honoured sirs, be settled fair by me.â

5. âTail, AnutÄ«racÄrÄ«; GambhÄ«racÄrÄ«, head;

The middle to the arbiter will properly be paid.â 
{3.335}

6. âBut for our strife, it would have long sufficed us without fail;

But now the jackal takes the fish, and leaves us head and tail.â

7. âEven as a king is glad to join a kingdom to his rule,

So I am glad to see my lord today with his mouth full.â 
[3.207]

8. âHow, being of the land, have you from water caught a fish?

How did you do the feat, my lord? Pray answer to my wish.â

9. âBy strife it is their weakness comes, by strife their means decay;

By strife the otters lost their prize; MÄyÄvÄ«, eat the prey.â 
{3.336}

10. âEven so when strife arises among men,

They seek an arbiter; heâs leader then;

Their wealth decays, and the kingâs coffers gain.â

After the lesson, the Teacher declared the Truths and identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the jackal was Upananda, the otters the two old men, the Tree DevatÄ who witnessed the cause was myself.â

## Full Story
âYou are confused.â
 The Teacher told this when staying in Jetavana, concerning the Perfection of Wisdom. The occasion of the story will appear in the UmmaggajÄtaka [Ja 546].

One day the monks sat in the Dhamma Hall and described the TathÄgataâs Perfection of Wisdom, âMonks, the TathÄgata is greatly wise, his wisdom is vast, ready, swift, sharp, crushing heretical doctrines, after having converted, by the power of his own knowledge, the brahmins KÅ«á¹­adanta and the rest, the ascetics Sabhiya and the rest, the thieves Aá¹gulimÄla and the rest, the Yakkhas Äá¸·avaka and the rest, the Devas Sakka and the rest, and the Brahmas Baka and the rest, made them humble, and ordained a vast multitude as ascetics and established them in the fruition of the paths of sanctification.â The Teacher came up and asked what they were discoursing about, and when they told him, he replied, âNot only now is the TathÄgata full of wisdom. In former days, even when his knowledge was immature, he was wise, as he went about for the sake of wisdom and knowledge,â and then he told a story of the past.

1. âYou are confused in thought, disturbed in sense,

Tears streaming from thine eyes are evidence;

What have you lost, or what do wish to gain

By coming hither? Give me answer plain.â 
{3.345}

2. âIf I go home my wife it is must die,

If I go not, the Yakkha said, âtis I;

That is the thought that pierces cruelly;

Explain the matter, Senaka, to me.â

3. âFirst with many a doubt I deal,

Now my tongue the truth declares;

Brahmin, in your bag of meal

A snake has entered unawares.â 
{3.347}

4. âTake a stick and beat the sack,

Dumb and double-tongued is he;

Cease your mind with doubts to rack;

Open sack, the snake youâll see.â

5. âFrightened, âmidst the assembled rout,

String of meal-sack he untied;

Angry crept a serpent out,

Hood erect, in all his pride.â

âWisdom is best, the good confess,

Like the moon in starry skies;

Virtue, fortune, righteousness,

Are the handmaids of the wise.â

6a. âGreat, king Janaka, your gain,

Seeing Senaka the wise.â 
{3.349}

6b. âDread your wisdom; veils are vain,

Brahmin, to your piercing eyes.


7. These seven hundred pieces, see,

Take them all, I give them you;

âTis to you I owe my life,

And the welfare of my wife.â

8. âFor reciting poetry

Wise men canât accept a wage;

Rather let us give to you,

Ere you take the homeward stage.â

âAá¹­á¹­hisena, many beggars.â
 
[3.216]
 The Teacher told this when dwelling in the shrine called AggÄá¸·ava near Äá¸·avi, concerning the regulations for the building of cells. 
See above, p. 52.
 The occasion was told in the Maá¹ikaá¹á¹­hajÄtaka [Ja 253] above.

Some monks who lived in Äá¸·avÄ« were begging from all quarters the materials for houses which they were getting made for themselves. They were for ever asking, âGive us a man, give us somebody to do servantâs work,â and so forth. Everybody was annoyed at this begging and solicitation. So much annoyed were they, that at sight of these monks they were startled and scared away.


It happened that the venerable monk MahÄkassapa entered Äá¸·avÄ«, and traversed the place in quest of alms. The people, as soon as they saw the elder, ran away as before. After mealtime, having returned from his rounds, he summoned the monks, and thus addressed them, âOnce Äá¸·avÄ« was a good place for alms; why is it so poor now?â They told him the reason.


Now the Fortunate One was at the time dwelling at the AggÄá¸·ava shrine. The elder came to the Fortunate One, and told him all about it. The Teacher convened the monks touching this matter. âI hear,â said he, âthat you are building houses and worrying everybody for help. Is this true?â They said it was.

The Teacher addressed the monks, saying: âMonks, formerly 
{3.352}
 before Buddha was born in the world, monastics of other dispensations, even though offered their choice by kings, never asked for alms, holding that begging from others was not agreeable or pleasant,â and so he told a story of the past time.

1. âAá¹­á¹­hisena, many beggars, though theyâre strangers utterly,

Throng to me with their petitions; why have you no suit for me?â 
[3.217] {3.353}

2. âNeither suitor, nor rejector of a suit, can pleasant be;

Thatâs the reason, be not angry, why I have no suit to thee.â

3. âHe who lives by sueing, and has not at proper season sued,

Makes another fall from merit, fails to gain a livelihood.


4. He who lives by sueing, and has aye at proper season sued,

Makes another man win merit, gains himself a livelihood.


5. Men of wisdom are not angry when they see the suitors throng;

Speak, my holy friend; the boon you ask for can never be wrong.â 
{3.354}

6. âSages never make petitions, worthy laymen ought to know;

7. âBrahmin, I offer you a thousand kine,

Red kine, and eke the leader of the herd;

Hearing but now those generous deeds of thine,

[3.218]
 The Teacher told this tale while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning Devadatta being swallowed up by the earth. Finding that the monks were talking about this in the Dhamma Hall, he said: âDevadatta has not been destroyed with his company now for the first time; he was destroyed before,â and he told a story of the past.

1. âLet not the wise man dwell where dwells his foe;

One night, two nights, so near will bring him woe.


2. A foolâs a foe to all who trust his word;

One monkey brought distress on all the herd.


3. A foolish chief, wise in his own conceit,

Comes ever, like this monkey, to defeat.


4. A strong fool is not good to guard the herd,

Curse to his kindred, like the decoy-bird.


5. One strong and wise is good the herd to guard,

Like Sakka to the Gods, his kinâs reward.


6. Who virtue, wisdom, learning, does possess,

His deeds himself and other men will bless.


7. Therefore virtue, knowledge, learning, and himself let him regard,

Either be a lonely saint or oâer the flock keep watch and ward.â

âSeventy and two.â
 The Teacher told this tale while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning the Brahma 
A Brahma means a being in one of the Brahma-loka heavens, three of which are mentioned below.
 Baka. In him a false Dhamma arose, namely, âThis present existence is perpetual, permanent, eternal, unchanging; apart from it there is no escape or release at all.â

1. âSeventy and two, O Gotama, are we

Righteous and great, from birth and age weâre free;

Our heaven is wisdomâs home, thereâs nought above;

And many others will this view approve.â

2. âShort your existence in this world; âtis wrong,

Baka, to think existence here is long;

A hundred thousand aeons past and gone

All your existence well to me is known.â

3. âOf wisdom infinite, O Lord, am I;

Birth, age, and sorrow, all beneath me lie;

What should I do with good works, long ago?

Yet tell me something, Lord, that I should know.â

4. âTo many a man of old you gave a drink

For thirst and parching drought ready to sink;

That virtuous deed of thine so long ago

Remembering, as if waked from sleep, I know. 
{3.361}


5. By Eá¹iâs bank you set the people free

When chained and held in close captivity;

That virtuous deed of thine so long ago

Remembering, as if waked from sleep, I know.


6. By Gangesâ stream the man you did set free,

Whose boat was seized by NÄga, cruelly

Lusting for flesh, and save him mightily;

That virtuous deed of thine, so long ago

Remembering, as if waked from sleep, I know. 
[3.221]


7. And I was Kappa, your disciple true,

Your wisdom and your virtues all I knew;

And now those deeds of thine so long ago

Remembering, as if waked from sleep, I know.â 
{3.363}

8. âYou know every life that has been mine;

Buddha you are, all wisdom sure is thine;

And sure your glorious majesty and state

Even this Brahma Realm illuminate.â

So the Teacher, making known his quality as Buddha and expounding the Dhamma, showed forth the Truths. At the end the thoughts of ten thousand Brahmas were freed from attachments and defilements. So the Lord became the refuge of many Brahmas, and going back from Brahmaloka to Jetavana preached the Dhamma in the way described and identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time Baka the Brahma was the ascetic Kesava, Kappa the disciple was myself.â

 The Teacher told this when dwelling in Jetavana, concerning the precept on the storing up of medicines.

 The occasion however arose in RÄjagaha. When the venerable Pilindiyavaccha went to the kingâs dwelling to set free the park-keeperâs family, 
MahÄvagga
 vi. 15. 1.
 he made the palace all of gold by his Supernormal Powers; and the people in their delight brought to that elder the five kinds of medicine. He gave them away to the Saá¹gha. So the Saá¹gha abounded in medicines, 
{3.364}
 and as they received the medicines, they filled pots and jars and bags in this way and laid them aside. People seeing this murmured, saying: âThose greedy monastics are hoarding in their houses.â The Teacher, hearing this thing, declared the precept, âWhatever medicines for sick monks (are received, must be used within seven days),â and said: âMonks, wise men of old, before the Buddha appeared, ordained in an outside sect and keeping only the five precepts, used to chide those who laid aside even grains of salt for the next day; but you, though ordained in such a dispensation which leads to safety, make a hoard for the second and the third day,â and so he told a story of the past.

1. âVillages full sixteen thousand with their wealth you threw away,

Treasuries with wealth in plenty; and youâre hoarding here today!â

2. âKandahar and all its province, all its wealth, you threw away,

Giving no more royal orders; and youâre ordering me today!â 
[3.224]

3. âIt is righteousness Iâm speaking, for I hate unrighteousness;

Righteousness when I am speaking, wrong on me leaves no impress.â

4. âWhatsoever words, if spoken, would to others cause offence,

Wise men leave those words unspoken, though of mighty consequence.â

5. âLet my hearer scatter chaff, or let him take offence or not,

Righteousness when I am speaking, wrong on me can leave no spot.â

6. âWere not wisdom and good conduct trained in some menâs lives to grow,

Many would go wandering idly like the blinded buffalo.


7. But since some are wisely trained in moral conduct fair to grow,

Thus it is that disciplined in paths of virtue others go.â 
{3.369}

After the lesson, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the Videhan ascetic was Änanda, the GandhÄra king was myself.â

âYou made yourself.â
 
[3.225]
 The Teacher told this while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning good works towards oneâs relatives. The occasion will appear in the BhaddasÄlajÄtaka [Ja 444]. 
[The reference is wrong, it is actually Ja 465. I include the story here.]

At SÄvatthi in the house of AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika there was always unfailing food for five hundred monks, and the same with VisÄkhÄ and the king of Kosala. But in the kingâs palace, various and fine as was the fare given, no one was friendly to the monks. The result was that the monks never ate in the palace, but they took their food and went off to eat it at the house of AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika or VisÄkhÄ or some other of their trusted friends.


One day the king said: âA present has been brought; take this to the monks,â and sent it to the refectory. An answer was brought that no monks were there in the refectory. âWhere are they gone?â he asked. They were sitting in their friendsâ houses to eat, was the reply. So the king after his morning meal came into the Teacherâs presence, and asked him, âGood sir, what is the best kind of food?â âThe food of friendship is the best, great king,â said he, âeven sour rice-gruel given by a friend becomes sweet.â âWell, sir, and with whom do the monks find friendship?â âWith their kindred, great king, or with the Sakya families.â Then the king thought, what if he were to make a Sakya girl his queen-consort; then the monks would be his friends, as it were with their own kindred.


So rising from his seat, he returned to the palace, and sent a message to Kapilavatthu to this effect, âPlease give me one of your daughters in marriage, for I wish to become connected with your family.â On receipt of this message the Sakyas gathered together and deliberated. âWe live in a place subject to the authority of the king of Kosala; if we refuse a daughter, he will be very angry, and if we give her, the custom of our clan will be broken. What are we to do?â Then MahÄnÄma said to them, âDo not trouble about it. I have a daughter, named VÄsabhakhattiyÄ. Her mother is a slave woman, NÄgamuá¹á¸Ä by name; she is some sixteen years of age, of great beauty and auspicious prospects, and by her fatherâs side noble. We will send her, as a girl nobly born.â The Sakyas agreed, and sent for the messengers, and said they were willing to give a daughter of the clan, and that they might take her with them at once. But the messengers reflected: âThese Sakyas are desperately proud, in matters of birth. Suppose they should send a girl who was not of them, and say that she was so? We will take none but one who eats along with them.â So they replied, âWell, we will take her, but we will take one who eats along with you.â


The Sakyas assigned a lodging for the messengers, and then wondered what to do. MahÄnÄma said: âNow do not trouble about it; I will find a way. At my mealtime bring in VÄsabhakhattiyÄ dressed up in her finery; then just as I have taken one mouthful, produce a letter, and say, âMy lord, such a king has sent you a letter; be pleased to hear his message at once.â â


They agreed; and as he was taking his meal they dressed and adorned the maid. âBring my daughter,â said MahÄnÄma, âand let her take food with me.â âIn a moment,â they said, âas soon as she is properly adorned,â and after a short delay they brought her in. Expecting to take food with her father, she dipped her hand into the same dish. MahÄnÄma had taken one mouthful with her, and put it in his mouth; but just as he stretched out his hand for another, they brought him a letter, saying: âMy lord, such a king has sent a letter to you; be pleased to hear his message at once.â Said MahÄnÄma, âGo on with your meal, my dear,â and holding his right hand in the dish, with his left took the letter and looked at it. As he examined the message the maiden went on eating. When she had eaten, he washed his hand and rinsed out his mouth. The messengers were firmly convinced that she was his daughter, for they did not divine the secret.


So MahÄnÄma sent away his daughter in great pomp. The messengers brought her to SÄvatthi, and said that this maiden was the true-born daughter of MahÄnÄma. The king was pleased, and caused the whole city to be decorated, and placed her upon a pile of treasure, and by a ceremonial sprinkling made her his chief queen. She was dear to the king, and beloved.


In a short time the queen conceived, and the king caused the proper treatment to be used; and at the end of ten months, she brought forth a son whose colour was a golden brown. On the day of his naming, the king sent a message to his grandmother, saying: âA son has been born to VÄsabhakhattiyÄ, daughter of the Sakya king; what shall his name be?â Now the courtier who was charged with this message was slightly deaf; but he went and told the kingâs grandmother. When she heard it, she said: âEven when VÄsabhakhattiyÄ had never borne a son, she was more than all the world; and now she will be the kingâs darling.â The deaf man did not hear the word, âdarlingâ aright, but thought she said: âViá¸Å«á¸abha,â so back he went to the king, and told him that he was to name the prince Viá¸Å«á¸abha. This, the king thought, must be some ancient family name, and so named him Viá¸Å«á¸abha. After this the prince grew up and was treated as a prince should be.


When he was at the age of seven years, having observed how the other princes received presents of toy elephants and horses and other toys from the family of their mothersâ fathers, the lad said to his mother, âMother, the rest of them get presents from their mothersâ family, but no one sends me anything. Are you an orphan?â Then she replied, âMy boy, your grandfathers are the Sakya kings, but they live a long way off, and that is why they send you nothing.â Again when he was sixteen, he said: âMother, I want to see your fatherâs family.â âDonât speak of it, child,â she said. âWhat will you do when you get there?â But though she put him off, he asked her again and again. At last his mother said: âWell, go then.â So the lad got his fatherâs consent, and set out with a number of followers. VÄsabhakhattiyÄ sent on a letter before him to this effect, âI am living here happily; let not my masters tell him anything of the secret.â But the Sakyas, on hearing of the coming of Viá¸Å«á¸abha, sent off all their young children into the country. âIt is impossible,â they said, âto receive him with respect.â


When the prince arrived at Kapilavatthu, the Sakyas had assembled in the royal rest-house. The prince approached the rest house, and waited. Then they said to him, âThis is your motherâs father, this is her brother,â pointing them out. He walked from one to the other, saluting them. But although he bowed to them till his back ached, not one of them vouchsafed a greeting; so he asked, âWhy is it that none of you greet me?â The Sakyas replied, âMy dear, the youngest princes are all in the country,â then they entertained him grandly.


After a few days stay, he set out for home with all his retinue. Just then a slave woman washed the seat which he had used in the rest house with milk-water, saying insultingly, âHereâs the seat where sat the son of VÄsabhakhattiyÄ, the slave girl!â A man who had left his spear behind was just fetching it, when he overheard the abuse of prince Viá¸Å«á¸abha. He asked what it meant. He was told that VÄsabhakhattiyÄ was born of a slave to MahÄnÄma the Sakya. This he told to the soldiers; a great uproar arose, all shouting, âVÄsabhakhattiyÄ is a slave womanâs daughter, so they say!â The prince heard it. âYes,â he thought, âlet them pour milk-water over the seat I sat in, to wash it! When I am king, I will wash the place with the blood of the hearts!â


When he returned to SÄvatthi, the courtiers told the whole matter to the king. The king was enraged against the Sakyas for giving him a slaveâs daughter to marry. He cut off all allowances made to VÄsabhakhattiyÄ and her son, and gave them only what is proper to be given to slave men and women.


Some few days later the Teacher came to the palace, and took a seat. The king approached him, and with a greeting said: âSir, I am told that your clansmen gave me a slaveâs daughter to marry. I have cut off their allowances, mother and son, and grant them only what slaves would get.â Said the Teacher, âThe Sakyas have done wrong, O great king! If they gave any one, they ought to have given a girl of their own blood. But, O king, this I say; VÄsabhakhattiyÄ is a kingâs daughter, and in the house of a noble king she has received the ceremonial sprinkling; Viá¸Å«á¸abha too was begotten by a noble king. Wise men of old have said, what matters the motherâs birth? The birth of the father is the measure; and to a poor wife, a picker of sticks, they gave the position of queen consort; and the son born of her obtained the sovereignty of Benares, twelve leagues in extent, and became king Kaá¹­á¹­havÄhana, the wood-carrier,â whereupon he told him the story of the Kaá¹­á¹­hahÄrijÄtaka [Ja 7].


When the king heard this speech he was pleased; and saying to himself, âThe fatherâs birth is the measure of the man,â he again gave mother and son the treatment suited to them.


Now the kingâs commander-in-chief was a man named Bandhula. His wife, MallikÄ, was barren, and he sent her away to KusinÄra, telling her to return to her own family. âI will go,â said she, âwhen I have saluted the Teacher.â She went to Jetavana, and greeting the TathÄgata stood waiting on one side. âWhere are you going?â he asked. She replied, âMy husband has sent me home, sir.â âWhy?â asked the Teacher. âI am barren, sir, I have no son.â âIf that is all,â said he, âthere is no reason why you should go. Return.â She was much pleased, and saluting the Teacher went home again. Her husband asked her why she had come back. She answered, âThe One with Ten Powers sent me back, my lord.â âThen,â said the commander-in-chief, âthe TathÄgata must have seen good reason.â The woman soon after conceived, and when her cravings began, told him of it. âWhat is it you want?â he asked. âMy lord,â said she, âI desire to go and bathe and drink the water of the tank in VesÄli City where the families of the kings get water for the ceremonial sprinkling.â The commander-in-chief promised to try. Seizing his bow, strong as a thousand bows, he put his wife in a chariot, and left SÄvatthi, and drove his chariot to VesÄlÄ«.


Now at this time there lived close to the gate a Licchavi named MahÄli, who had been educated by the same teacher as the king of Kosalaâs general, Bandhula. This man was blind, and used to advise the Licchavis on all matters temporal and spiritual. Hearing the clatter of the chariot as it went over the threshold, he said: âThe noise of the chariot of Bandhula the Mallian! This day there will be fear for the Licchavis!â By the tank there was set a strong guard, within and without; above it was spread an iron net; not even a bird could find room to get through. But the general, dismounting from his carriage, put the guards to flight with the blows of his sword, and burst through the iron network, and in the tank bathed his wife and gave her to drink of the water; then after bathing himself, he set MallikÄ in the chariot, and left the town, and went back by the way he came.


The guards went and told all to the Licchavis. Then were the kings of the Licchavis angry; and five hundred of them, mounted in five hundred chariots, departed to capture Bandhula the Mallian. They informed MahÄli of it, and he said: âGo not! For he will slay you all.â But they said: âNay, but we will go.â âThen if you come to a place where a wheel has sunk up to the nave, you must return. If you return not then, return back from that place when you hear the noise of a thunderbolt. If then you turn not, turn back from that place where you shall see a hole in front of your chariots. Go no further!â But they did not turn back according to his word, but pursued on and on.


MallikÄ espied them and said: âThere are chariots in sight, my lord.â âThen tell me,â said he, âwhen they all look like one chariot.â When they all in a line looked like one, she said: âMy lord, I see as it were the head of one chariot.â âTake the reins, then,â said he, and gave the reins into her hand; he stood upright in the chariot, and strung his bow. The chariot-wheel sank into the earth nave-deep. The Licchavis came to the place, and saw it, but turned not back. The other went on a little further, and twanged the bow string; then came a noise as the noise of a thunderbolt, yet even then they turned not, but pursued on and on. Bandhula stood up in the chariot and sped a shaft, and it cleft the heads of all the five hundred chariots, and passed right through the five hundred kings in the place where the girdle is fastened, and then buried itself in the earth. As they did not perceive that they were wounded they pursued still, shouting, âStop, holloa, stop!â Bandhula stopped his chariot, and said: âYou are dead men, and I cannot fight with the dead.â âWhat!â they said, âdead, such as we now are?â âLoose the girdle of the first man,â said Bandhula.


They loosed his girdle, and at the instant the girdle was loosed, he fell dead. Then he said to them, âYou are all of you in the same condition; go to your homes, and set in order what should be ordered, and give your directions to your wives and families, and then doff your armour.â They did so, and then all of them gave up the ghost.


And Bandhula conveyed MallikÄ to SÄvatthi. She bore twin sons sixteen times in succession, and they were all mighty men and heroes, and became perfected in all manner of accomplishments. Each one of them had a thousand men to attend him, and when they went with their father to wait on the king, they alone filled the courtyard of the palace to overflowing.


One day some men who had been defeated in court on a false charge, seeing Bandhula approach, raised a great outcry, and informed him that the judges of the court had supported a false charge. So Bandhula went into the court, and judged the case, and gave each man his own. The crowd uttered loud shouts of applause. The king asked what it meant, and on hearing was much pleased; all those officers he sent away, and gave Bandhula charge of the judgement court, and thenceforward he judged aright. Then the former judges became poor, because they no longer received bribes, and they slandered Bandhula in the kingâs ear, accusing him of aiming at the kingdom himself. The king listened to their words, and could not control his suspicions. âBut,â he reflected, âif he be slain here, I shall be blamed.â He instigated certain men to harry the frontier districts; then sending for Bandhula, he said: âThe borders are in a blaze; go with your sons and capture the brigands.â With him he also sent other men sufficient, mighty men of war, with instructions to kill him and his two-and-thirty sons, and cut off their heads, and bring them back.


While he was yet on the way, the hired brigands got wind of the generalâs coming, and took to flight. He settled the people of that district in their homes, and quieted the province, and set out for home. Then when he was not far from the city, those warriors cut off his head and the heads of his sons.


On that day MallikÄ had sent an invitation to the two chief disciples along with five hundred of the monks. Early in the forenoon a letter was brought to her, with news that her husband and sons had lost their heads. When she heard this, without a word to a soul, she tucked the letter in her dress, and waited upon the company of the monks. Her attendants had given rice to the monks, when bringing in a bowl of ghee they happened to break the bowl just in front of the elders. Then the Captain of the Dhamma said: âPots are made to be broken; do not trouble about it.â The lady produced her letter from the fold of her dress, saying: âHere I have a letter informing me that my husband and his two-and-thirty sons have been beheaded. If I do not trouble about that, am I likely to trouble when a bowl is broken?â The Captain of the Dhamma now began, âUnseen, unknown,â and so forth, then rising from his seat uttered a discourse [Sallasutta, Snp 3.8], and went home.


She summoned her two-and-thirty daughters-in-law, and to them said: âYour husbands, though innocent, have reaped the fruit of their former deeds. Do not you grieve, nor commit a wrong worse even than the kingâs.â This was her advice. The kingâs spies hearing this speech brought word to him that they were not angry. Then the king was distressed, and went to her dwelling, and craving pardon of MallikÄ and her sonsâ wives, offered a boon. She replied, âBe it accepted.â She set out the funeral feast, and bathed, and then went before the king. âMy lord,â said she, âyou granted me a boon. I want nothing but this, that you permit my two-and-thirty daughters-in-law and me to go back to our own homes.â The king consented. Each of her two-and-thirty sonsâ wives she sent away to her home, and herself returned to the home of her family in the city of KusinÄra. And the king gave the post of commander-in-chief to one DÄ«ghakÄrÄyana, sisterâs son to the general Bandhula. But he went about picking faults in the king and saying: âHe murdered my uncle.â


Ever after the murder of the innocent Bandhula the king was devoured by remorse, and had no peace of mind, felt no joy in being king.


At that time the Teacher dwelt near a country town of the Sakyas, named Uá¸·umpa. There went the king, pitched a camp not far from the park, and with a few attendants went to the monastery to salute the Teacher. The five symbols of royalty he handed to KÄrÄyana, and alone entered the Perfumed Chamber. All that followed must be described as in the Dhammacetiyasutta [MN 89]. When he entered the Perfumed Chamber, KÄrÄyana took those symbols of royalty, and made Viá¸Å«á¸abha king; and leaving behind for the king one horse and a serving woman, he went to SÄvatthi.


After a pleasant conversation with the Teacher, the king on his return saw no army. He enquired of the woman, and learned what had been done. Then set out for the city of RÄjagaha, resolved to take his nephew with him, and capture Viá¸Å«á¸abha. It was late when he came to the city, and the gates were shut; and lying down in a shed, exhausted by exposure to wind and sun, he died there.


When the night began to grow brighter, the woman began to wail, âMy lord, the king of Kosala is past help!â The sound was heard, and news came to the king. He performed the obsequies of his uncle with great magnificence.


Viá¸Å«á¸abha once firmly established on the throne remembered that grudge of his, and determined to destroy the Sakyas one and all; to which end he set out with a large army. That day at dawn the Teacher, looking forth over the world, saw destruction threatening his kin. âI must help my kindred,â thought he. In the forenoon he went in search of alms, then after returning from his meal lay down lion-like in his Perfumed Chamber, and in the evening-time, having past through the air to a spot near Kapilavatthu, sat beneath a tree that gave scanty shade. Hard by that place, a huge and shady banyan tree stood on the boundary of Viá¸Å«á¸abhaâs realms. Viá¸Å«á¸abha seeing the Teacher approached and saluting him, said: âWhy, sir, are you sitting under so thin a tree in all this heat? Sit beneath this shady banyan, sir.â He replied, âLet be, O king! The shade of my kindred keeps me cool.â âThe Teacher,â thought the other, âmust have come here to protect his clansmen.â So he saluted the Teacher, and returned again to SÄvatthi. And the Teacher rising went to Jetavana.


A second and a third time the king called to mind his grudge against the Sakyas, a second and a third time he set forth, and again saw the Teacher seated in the same place, then again returned.


A fourth time he set out; and the Teacher, scanning the former deeds of the Sakyas, perceived that nothing could do away with the effect of their evildoing, in casting poison into the river; so he did not go there the fourth time. Then king Viá¸Å«á¸abha slew all the Sakyas, beginning with babes at the breast, and with the blood of the hearts washed the bench, and returned.

The monks began talking in the Dhamma Hall, saying: âThe supreme Buddha does good works towards his relatives.â 
{3.370}
 When the Teacher had asked and been told their theme, he said: âMonks, this is not the first time a TathÄgata has done good works towards his relatives,â and so he told a story of the past time.

1. âYou made yourself a bridge for them to pass in safety through;

What are you then to them, monkey, and what are they to you?â

2. âVictorious king, I guard the herd, I am their lord and chief,

When they were filled with fear of you and stricken sore with grief.


3. I leapt a hundred times the length of bow outstretched that lies,

When I had bound a bamboo-shoot firmly around my thighs;


4. I reached the tree like thunder-cloud sped by the tempestâs blast;

I lost my strength, but reached a bough; with hands I held it fast.


5. And as I hung extended there held fast by shoot and bough,

My monkeys passed across my back and are in safety now.


6. Therefore I fear no pain of death, bonds do not give me pain,

The happiness of those was won oâer whom I used to reign.


7. A parable for you, O king, if you the truth would read;

The happiness of kingdom and of army and of steed

And city must be dear to you, if you would rule indeed.â 
{3.374}

After the lesson, the Teacher declared the Truths and identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the king was Änanda, the monkeyâs retinue the assembly, and the monkey-king myself.â

âA mango in a forest.â
 
[3.228]
 The Teacher told this when dwelling in Jetavana, concerning overcoming wrong. The occasion will appear in the PÄnÄ«yajÄtaka [Ja 459]. 
[But that 
JÄtaka
 refers us to this one for the details!]
 At that time in SÄvatthi five hundred friends, who had become ascetics, dwelling in the House of the Golden Pavement, had lustful thoughts at midnight. The Teacher regards his disciples three times a night and three times a day, six times every night and day, as a jay guards her egg, or a yak-cow her tail, or a mother her beloved son, or a one-eyed man his remaining eye; so in the very instant he overcame wrong which was beginning. He was observing Jetavana on that midnight and knowing the monksâ conduct and their thoughts, he considered, âThis wrong among these monks if it grows will destroy the foundation for becoming an Arahat. I will this moment repudiate this wrong and show them how to become an Arahat,â so leaving the perfumed chamber he called Änanda, 
{3.376}
 and bidding him collect all the monks dwelling in the place, he got them together and sat down on the seat prepared for Buddha. He said: âMonks, it is not right to live in the power of defiled thoughts; a wrong if it grows brings great ruin like an enemy; a monk ought to rebuke even a little wrong; wise men of old seeing even a very slight cause, rebuked a defiled thought that had begun and so became Paccekabuddhas,â and so he told a story of the past.

Three robes, bowl, razor, needles, strainer, belt,

A pious monk those eight marks should own,

1. âA mango in a forest did I see

Full-grown, and dark, fruitful exceedingly;

And for its fruit those men did the tree break,

âTwas this inclined my heart the bowl to take.â


2. âA bracelet, polished by a hand renowned,

A woman wore on each wrist without sound;

One touched the other and a noise did wake;

âTwas this inclined my heart the bowl to take.â


3. âBirds in a flock a bird unfriended tore,

Who all alone a lump of carrion bore;

The bird was smitten for the carrionâs sake

âTwas this inclined my heart the bowl to take.â


4. âA bull in pride among his fellows paced;

High rose his back, with strength and beauty graced;

From lust he died; a horn his wound did make;

âTwas this inclined my heart the bowl to take.â
 {3.381}

5. âKaliá¹gaâs king Karaá¹á¸u, GandhÄraâs Naggaji,

PaÃ±cÄlaâs ruler Dummukha, Videhaâs great Nimi,

Have left their thrones and live the monastic life sinlessly.


6. Here their godlike forms they show

Each one like a blazing fire;

Bhaggavi, I too will go,

Leaving all that men desire.â 
{3.382}

7. â âTis the appointed time, I know;

Better teachers may not be;

Bhaggava, I too will go,

Like a bird from hand set free.â

8. âHaving seen they could distinguish salt from saltless, boiled from raw,

I became a monk; leave me, we can each follow the law.â

After the lesson, the Teacher declared the Truths, and identified the JÄtaka, After the Truths five hundred monks became Arahats. âAt that time the daughter was Uppalavaá¹á¹Ä, the son was RÄhula, the female ascetic RÄhulaâs mother, and the ascetic was myself.â

âI carried for the king.â
 
[3.233] {3.384}
 The Teacher told this when dwelling in the Ghosita forest near KosambÄ«, concerning BhaddavatikÄ, king Udenaâs female elephant. Now the way in which this elephant was adorned and the royal lineage of Udena will be set forth in the MÄtaá¹gajÄtaka [Ja 497]. 
[Unfortunately, the said 
JÄtaka
 provides no details about these matters.]
 One day this elephant going out of the city in the morning saw the Buddha surrounded by a multitude of saints, in the incomparable majesty of a Buddha, entering the city for alms, and falling at the TathÄgataâs feet, with lamentation she prayed to him, saying: âLord who knowest all, saviour of the whole world, when I was young and able to do work, Udena, the rightful king, loved me, saying, âMy life and kingdom and queen are all due to her,â and gave me great honour, adorning me with all ornaments; he had my stall smeared with perfumed earth, and coloured hangings put round it, and a lamp lit with perfumed oil, and a dish of incense set there, he had a golden pot set on my dunghill, and made me stand on a coloured carpet, and gave me royal food of many choice flavours; but now when I am old and cannot do work, he has cut off all that honour; unprotected and destitute I live by eating ketaka fruit in the forest; I have no other refuge; make Udena think on my merits and restore me again my old honour, O Lord.â


The Teacher said: âGo you, I will speak to the king and get your old honour restored,â and he went to the door of the kingâs dwelling. The king made Buddha enter, and gave great entertainment in the palace to the assembly of monks following Buddha. When the meal was over, the Teacher gave thanks to the king and asked, âO king, where is BhaddavatikÄ?â âLord, I know not.â âO king, after giving honour to servants, it is not right to take it away in their old age, it is right to be grateful and thankful; BhaddavatikÄ is now old, she is worn with age and unprotected, and she lives by eating ketaka fruit in the wood; it is not meet for you to leave her unprotected in her old age,â so telling BhaddavatikÄâs merits and saying: âRestore all her former honours,â 
{3.385}
 he departed. The king did so. It was spread over the whole city that the former honour was restored because the Buddha had spoken of her merits.


This became known in the assembly of the monks, and the monks discussed it in their meeting. The Teacher, coming and hearing that this was their subject, said: âMonks, this is not the first time that the Buddha has by telling her merits got her former honours restored,â and he told a story of the past.

1. âI carried for the king of old; was he not satisfied?

With weapons at my breast I faced the fight with mighty stride.


2. My feats in battle done of old does not the king forget,

And such good services I did for couriers as were set?


3. Helpless and kinless now am I; surely my death is near,

To serve a potter when Iâm come as his dung-carrier.â 
{3.387}

4. âBy selfish hopes men regulate the honours that they pay;

As you the elephant, they throw the outworn slave away.


5. Good deeds and services received whenever men forget,

Ruin pursues the business still on which their hearts are set.


6. Good deeds and services received if men do not forget,

Success attends the business still on which their hearts are set. 
[3.235]


7. To all the multitude around this blessed truth I tell;

Be grateful all, and for reward you long in heaven shall dwell.â 
{3.388}

After the lesson, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the female elephant was BhaddavatikÄ, the king Änanda, the minister was I myself.â

âDeep in the wood.â
 The Teacher told this while dwelling at Jetavana, about a certain old monk. The story was that this monk ordained a novice, who waited on him but soon died of a fatal disease. The old man went about weeping and wailing for his death.


Seeing him, the monks began to talk in the Dhamma Hall, âSirs, this old monk goes about weeping and wailing for the noviceâs death; he must surely have neglected the meditation on death.â The Teacher came, and hearing the subject of their talk, he said: âMonks, this is not the first time this man is weeping for the otherâs death,â and so he told the old tale.

1. âDeep in the wood heâd meet me; but today

No elephant I see; where does he stray?â 
[3.236]

2. â âTis he that lies in death cut down as a tender shoot is shred;

Low on the ground he lies; alas, my elephant is dead.â

3. âTo sorrow for the dead does ill become

The lone ascetic, freed from ties of home.â

4. âShould man with beast consort, O Sakka, grief

For a lost playmate finds in tears relief.â

5. âSuch as to weep are fain may still lament the dead,

Weep not, O sage, âtis vain to weep, the wise have said.


6. If by our tears we might prevail against the grave,

Thus would we all unite our dearest ones to save.â

7. âAs ghee-fed flame that blazes out amain

Is quenched with water, so he quenched my pain.


8. With sorrowâs shaft my heart was wounded sore;

He healed my wound and did my life restore. 
{3.391}


9. The barb extracted, full of joy and peace,

At Sakkaâs words I from my sorrow cease.â

 The Teacher told this tale while dwelling in Jetavana, about the Great Renunciation. The monks were sitting in the Dhamma Hall, praising the One with Ten Powersâ renunciation. The Teacher, finding that this was their topic, said: âMonks, it is not strange that I should now make the Great Renunciation and retirement from the world, I who have for many hundred thousand ages exercised perfection; of old also I gave up the reign over the kingdom of KÄsi, three hundred leagues in extent, and made the renunciation,â and so he told the old tale.

1. âHeretofore the hairs were dark

Clustering about my brow;

White today; SusÄ«ma, mark!

Time for dispensation now!â

2. âMine, not thine, the silvered hair;

Mine the head from which it came;

For your good the lie I dare;

Like a tender plant in spring!

Keep your kingdom, smile on me!

Seek not now what age will bring!â

Swaying like the tender stalk,

In her pride of form arrayed;

Men are witched whereâer she walk.


5. âTis the same one I have scanned

(Eighty, ninety, years have passed),

Quivering, palsied, staff in hand,

Bent like rafter tree at last.â

6. âSuch the thoughts I ponder oâer;

Lonely nights the thoughts allow;

Laymanâs life I love no more;

Time for dispensation now!


7. Delight in laymanâs life is a weak stay;

The wise man cuts it off and goes his way,

Renouncing joys of sense and all their sway.â

After the lesson, the Teacher declared the Truths, and giving the drink of ambrosia to many, he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the chief queen was the mother of RÄhula, the king was Änanda, and king SusÄ«ma was I myself.â

[Otherwise known as Ja 459 
PÄnÄ«yajÄtaka

The Teacher regards his disciples three times a night and three times a day, six times every night and day, as a jay guards her egg, or a yak-cow her tail, or a mother her beloved son, or a one-eyed man his remaining eye; so in the very instant he overcame wrong which was beginning.

I will this moment repudiate this wrong and show them how to become Arahats,â so leaving the perfumed chamber he called Änanda, and bidding him collect all the monks dwelling in the place, he got them together and sat down on the seat prepared for Buddha.

On this occasion the Teacher, perceiving that five hundred monks were overcome by thoughts of desire in the House of the Golden Pavement, 
[3.240]
 gathered the assembly and said: âMonks, it is right to distrust where distrust is proper; defilements surround a man as banyans and such plants grow up around a tree; in this way of old a spirit dwelling in the top of a cotton tree saw a bird voiding the banyan seeds it had eaten among the branches of the cotton tree, and became terrified lest her abode should thereby come to destruction,â and so he told a story of the past.

1. âI bore with me the thousand fathoms length of that king snake;

His size and my huge bulk you bore and yet you did not quake.


2. But now this tiny bird you bear, so small compared to me;

You shake with fear and tremble; but wherefore, cotton tree?â

3. âFlesh is your food, O king; the birdâs is fruit;

Seeds of the banyan and the fig heâll shoot

And Bodhi tree too, and all my trunk pollute;


4. They will grow trees in shelter of my stem,

And I shall be no tree, thus hid by them. 
{3.399}


5. Other trees, once strong of root and rich in branches, plainly show

How the seeds that birds do carry in destruction lay them low.


6. Parasitic growths will bury eâen the mighty forest tree;

This is why, O king, I quiver when the fear to come I see.â 
[3.241]

7. âFear is right if things are fearful; âgainst the coming danger guard;

Wise men look on both worlds calmly if they present fears discard.â

After the lesson, the Teacher declared the Truths, beginning with the words, âIt is right to distrust where distrust is proper,â and identified the JÄtaka, after the Truths

## Full Story
âThe righteous king.â
 The Teacher told this tale while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning the Kosala kingâs favour to a stranger. At one time, the story goes, that king showed no favour to his old warriors who came to him in the usual way, but gave honour and hospitality to strangers coming for the first time. He went to fight in a disturbed frontier province; but his old warriors would not fight, thinking that the newcomers who were in favour would do so; and the newcomers would not, thinking that the old warriors would. The rebels prevailed. The king, knowing that his defeat was owing to the mistake he had made in showing favour to newcomers, returned to SÄvatthi. He resolved to ask the One with Ten Powers whether he was the only king who had ever been defeated for that reason; so after the morning meal he went to Jetavana and put the question to the Teacher. The Teacher answered, âGreat king, yours is not the only case; former kings also were defeated by reason of the favour they showed to newcomers,â and so, at the kingâs request, he told a story of the past.

1. âThe righteous king Yudhiá¹­á¹­hila once asked Vidhura wise:

âBrahmin, do know in whose lone heart much bitter sorrow lies?â â

2. âA brahmin with a flock of goats, of high Vasiá¹­á¹­haâs race,

Kept smoking fire by night and day in forest dwelling-place.


3. Smelling the smoke, a herd of deer, by gnats sore pestered, come

To find a dwelling for the rains near DhÅ«makÄriâs home.


4. The deer have all attention now; his goats receive no care,

They come and go untended all, and so they perish there. 
{3.402}


5. But now the gnats have left the wood, the autumnâs clear of rain;

The deer must seek the mountain-heights and river-springs again.


6. The brahmin sees the deer are gone and all his goats are dead;

Jaundice attacks him worn with grief, and all his colourâs fled.


7. So he who disregards his own, and calls a stranger dear,

Like DhÅ«makÄri, mourns alone with many a bitter tear.â

After the lesson, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the Kuru king was Änanda, DhÅ«makÄri was Pasenadi, king of Kosala, and Vidhurapaá¹á¸ita was myself.â

Uppalavaá¹á¹Ä = DevatÄ.

âWho is it that wakes.â
 
{3.403}
 The Teacher told this tale while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning a certain lay brother. He was a disciple who had entered on the First Path. He set out by a forest road from SÄvatthi with a caravan of carts. At a certain pleasant watered spot the leader of the caravan unyoked five hundred carts, and arranging for food, both hard and soft, he took up his lodging there. The men lay down here and there to sleep.


The lay brother practised walking meditation at the root of a tree near the leader of the caravan. Five hundred robbers planned to plunder the caravan; with various weapons in their hands they surrounded it and waited. Seeing the lay brother at his walk they stood waiting to begin plundering when he should go to sleep. He went on walking all night.


At dawn the robbers threw away the sticks and stones and other weapons they had picked up; they went away, saying: âMaster caravan-leader, you are owner of your property because you have got your life owing to that man who keeps awake so diligently; you should pay honour to him.â The caravan men rising betimes saw the stones and other things thrown away by the robbers and gave honour to the lay brother, recognising that they owed their lives to him. The lay brother went to his destination and did his business; then he returned to SÄvatthi and went on to Jetavana; there he saluted and did homage to the TathÄgata and sat at his feet, and on his invitation to declare himself, he told the tale. The Teacher said: âLay brother, it is not you alone who have gained special merit by waking and watching, wise men of old did the same.â And so at the lay brotherâs request, he told a story of the past.

1. âWho is it that wakes when others sleep and sleeps while others wake?

Who is it can read my riddle, who to this will answer make?â 
[3.244]

2. âI am he who wakes while others sleep, and sleeps while others wake.

I am he who can read your riddle, I to you can answer make.â

3. âHow is it you wake while others sleep, and sleep while others wake?

How is it you read my riddle, how this answer do you make?â

4. âSome men forget that virtue lies in stern sobriety,

When such are sleeping Iâm awake, O spirit of the tree.


5. Passion and vice and ignorance in some have ceased to be;

When such are waking then I sleep, DevatÄ of the tree.


6. So it is I wake while others sleep, and sleep while others wake;

So it is I read your riddle, so to you I answer make.â 
{3.405}

7. âGood it is you wake while others sleep, and sleep while others wake;

Good your reading of my riddle, good the answer that you make.â

After the lesson, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time, the DevatÄ was Uppalavaá¹á¹Ä, the ascetic was myself.â

## Full Story
âService done.â
 The Teacher told this tale while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning queen MallikÄ. She was the daughter of the chief of the garland-makers of SÄvatthi, extremely beautiful and very good. When she was sixteen years of age, as she was going to a flower-garden with some other girls, she had three portions of sour gruel in a flower-basket. As she was leaving the town, she saw the Fortunate One entering it, diffusing radiance and surrounded by the assembly of the monks; and she brought him the three portions of gruel.
 [3.245]


The Teacher accepted, holding out his royal bowl. She saluted the TathÄgataâs feet with her head, and taking her joy as subject of meditation, stood on one side. Observing her the Teacher smiled. The venerable Änanda wondered why the TathÄgata smiled and asked him the question. The Teacher told him the reason, âÄnanda, this girl will be today the chief queen of the Kosala king through the fruit of these portions of gruel.â The girl went on to the flower-garden. 
{3.406}


That very day the Kosala king fought with AjÄtasattu and fled away in defeat. As he came on his horse he heard the sound of her singing, and being attracted by it he rode towards the garden. The girlâs merit was ripe; so when she saw the king she came without running away, and seized at the bridle by the horseâs nose. The king from horseback asked if she was married or no. Hearing that she was not, he dismounted, and being wearied with wind and sun rested for a little time in her lap; then he made her mount, and with a great army entered the town and brought her to her own house. At evening he sent a chariot and with great honour and pomp brought her from her house, set her on a heap of jewels, anointed her and made her chief queen. From that time onward she was the dear, beloved and devoted wife of the king, possessed of faithful servants and the five feminine charms; and she was a favourite of the Buddhas. It became noised abroad through the whole city that she had attained such prosperity because she had given the three portions of gruel to the Teacher.


One day they began a discussion in the Dhamma Hall, âSirs, queen MallikÄ gave three portions of gruel to the Buddhas, and as the fruit of that, on the very same day she was anointed queen; great indeed is the virtue of Buddhas.â The Teacher came, asked and was told the subject of the monkâs talk; he said: âIt is not strange, monks, that MallikÄ has become chief queen of the Kosala king by giving three portions of gruel to the omniscient Buddha alone; for why? It is because of the great virtue of Buddhas; wise men of old gave gruel without salt or oil to Paccekabuddhas, and owing to that attained in their next birth the glory of being kings in KÄsi, three hundred leagues in extent,â and so he told a story of the past.

1. âService done to Buddhas high

Neâer, they say, is reckoned cheap;

Alms of gruel, saltless, dry,

Bring me this reward to reap.


2. Elephant and horse and kine,

Gold and corn and all the land,

Troops of girls with form divine;

Alms have brought them to my hand.â 
{3.409}

3. âGlorious and righteous king,

Many a time the song you sing,

In exceeding joy of heart;

Pray to me the cause impart.â 
{3.411}

4. âThis the city, but the station different, in my previous birth;

Servant was I to another, hireling, but of honest worth.


5. Going from the town to labour four ascetics once I saw,

Passionless and calm in bearing, perfect in the moral law.


6. All my thoughts went to those Buddhas; as they sat beneath the tree,

With my hands I brought them gruel, offering of piety.


7. Such the virtuous deed of merit; lo! the fruit I reap today

All the kingly state and riches, all the land beneath my sway.â 
{3.412}

8. âEat, due alms remembering,

Set the wheel of right to roll;

Flee injustice, mighty king,

Righteously your realm control.â 
[3.248]

9. âStill I make that road my own

Walking in the path of right,

Where the good, fair queen, have gone;

Saints are pleasant to my sight.â 
{3.413}

10. âLady, like a DevaccharÄ,

You the crowd of maids outshine;

For what gracious deed was given

Meed of beauty so divine?â

11. âI was once a handmaidâs slave

At Ambaá¹­á¹­haâs royal court,

To modesty my heart I gave,

To virtue and to good report.


12. In a begging monkâs bowl

Once an alms of rice I put;

Generosity had filled my soul;

Such the deed, and lo! the fruit.â

At the end of the lesson, the Teacher identified the birth, âAt that time the queen was the mother of RÄhula, and the king was myself.â

 The Teacher told this while dwelling in the Bamboo Grove, concerning Devadattaâs going about to kill him.


They were discussing it in the Dhamma Hall, âSirs, Devadatta 
{3.415}
 is going about to kill the TathÄgata, he has hired bowmen, thrown down a rock, let loose NÄlÄgiri, and uses special means for the destruction of the TathÄgata.â The Teacher came and asked the subject of their discussion as they sat together; when they told him, he said: âMonks, this is not the first time he has gone about to kill me; but he could not even make me afraid, and gained only sorrow for himself,â and so he told a story of the past.

1. âTerror and fear fall on me even now,

For then a man or beast did shake a bough.â

2. âMy true wifeâs home is near at hand; my love will make me be

Pale like Parantapa and thin, at quivering of a tree.â

To pallor like Parantapaâs at shaking of a bough.â

5. âSurely that sound has come to you and told you what befell;

Surely the man who bent the bough has come the tale to tell.


6. The foolish thought that once I had has reached your knowledge now;

That day a witness, man or beast, was there and shook the bough.â

7. â âTwas thus you slew my father with traitârous word, untrue;

You hid his body in the boughs; now fear has come to you.â 
{3.421}

After the lesson, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time Devadatta was the old king, I myself was the young one.â

## Full Story
âRobed in white.â
 
[3.253] {3.422}
 The Teacher told this tale while dwelling at Jetavana, concerning a man who supported his mother. The story is that the man was of good family and conduct in SÄvatthi, on his fatherâs death he became devoted to his mother and tended her with the services of mouth-washing, teeth-cleansing, bathing, feet-washing and the like, and also by giving her gruel, rice and other food. She said to him, âDear son, there are other duties in a householderâs life, you must marry a maid of a suitable family, who will attend to me, and then you can do your proper work.â âMother, it is for my own good and pleasure that I wait on you, who else would wait on you so well?â âSon, you ought to do something to advance the fortune of our house.â âI have no care for a householderâs life; I will wait on you, and after you are dead and burned I will become an ascetic.â


She pressed him again and again, and at last, without winning him over or gaining his consent, she brought him a maid of a suitable family. He married and lived with her, because he would not oppose his mother. She observed the great attention with which her husband waited on his mother, and desirous of imitating it she too waited on her with care. Noticing his wifeâs devotion, he gave her thenceforth all the pleasant food he could get. As time went on she foolishly thought in her pride, âHe gives me all the pleasant food he gets, he must be anxious to get rid 
{3.423}
 of his mother and I will find some means for doing so.â


So one day she said: âHusband, your mother scolds me when you leave the house.â He said nothing. She thought: âI will irritate the old woman and make her disagreeable to her son,â and thenceforth she gave her rice-gruel either very hot or very cold or very salt or saltless. When the old woman complained that it was too hot or too salt, she threw in cold water enough to fill the dish, and then on complaints of its being cold and saltless, she would make a great outcry, âJust now you said it was too hot and too salt, who can satisfy you?â


So at the bath she would throw very hot water on the old womanâs back, when she said: âDaughter, my back is burning,â the other would throw some very cold water on her, and on complaints of this, she would make a story to the neighbours, âThis woman said just now it was too hot, now she screams âit is too cold,â who can endure her impudence?â If the old woman complained that her bed was full of fleas, she would take the bed out and shake her own bed over it and then bring it back declaring, âIâve given it a shake,â the good old lady, having twice as many fleas biting her 
[3.254]
 now, would spend the night sitting up and complain of being bitten all night; the other would retort, âYour bed was shaken yesterday and the day before too, who can satisfy all such a womanâs needs?â


To set the old womanâs son against her, she would scatter phlegm and mucus and grey hairs here and there, and when he asked who was making the whole house so dirty, she would say, âYour mother does it; but if she is told not to do so, she makes an outcry, I canât stay in the same house with such an old wretch; you must decide whether she stays or I.â He hearkened to her and said: âWife, you are yet young and can get a living wherever you go, but my mother is weak and I am her stay, go and depart to your own kin.â When she heard this, she was afraid and thought: âHe cannot break with his mother who is so very dear to him, but if I go to my old home, I shall have a miserable life of separation, I will conciliate my mother-in-law and tend her as of old,â 
{3.424}
 and thenceforth she did so.


One day that lay brother went to Jetavana to hear the Dhamma, saluting the Teacher he stood on one side. The Teacher asked him if he were not careless of his old duties, if he were dutiful in tending his mother. He answered, âYes, Lord, my mother brought me a maid to wife against my will, she did such and such unseemly things,â telling him all, âbut the woman could not make me break with my mother, and now she tends her with all respect.â The Teacher heard the story and said: âThis time you would not do her bidding, but formerly you cast out your mother at her bidding and owing to me took her back again to your house and tended her,â and at the manâs request he told a story of the past.

1. âRobed in white, with dripping hair,

Why, KaccÄni, 
She is called KÄtiyÄni in the eighth verse [another way of spelling KaccÄni.]
 boil the pot?

Washing rice and sesame there,

Will you use them when theyâre hot?â

2. âBrahmin, not for food will I

Use the sesame and the rice,

Dhammaâs dead; its memory

I would crown with sacrifice.â 
{3.426}

3. âLady, think ere you decide,

Who has told you such a lie?

Strong in might and thousand-eyed

Perfect Dhamma cannot die.â

4. âBrahmin, I have witness strong,

Dhammaâs dead I must believe,

All men now who follow wrong

Great prosperity receive.


5. Barren once, my good sonâs spouse

Beats me, and she bears a son,

She is lady of our house,

I an outcast and undone.â

6. âNay, I live eternally; 
Sakka identifies himself with Right.

âTwas for your sake that I came,

She beat you; but her son and she

Shall be ashes in my flame.â 
{3.427}

7. âKing of gods, your will be done,

If for me you left the sky,

May my children and their son

Live with me in amity.â 
[3.256]

8. âKÄtiyÄniâs will be done,

Beaten, you on Dhamma rely,

With your children and their son

Share one home in amity.â

9. âJoyful with her good sonâs wife

KÄtiyÄni then did dwell,

Sakka pacified their strife,

Son and grandson tend her well.â

After the lesson the Teacher declared the Truths and identified the JÄtaka, after the Truths that lay brother was established in the fruition of the First Path. âAt that time the man who supported his mother was the man who is supporting his mother today, the wife of that time was the wife of today, and Sakka was myself.â

## Full Story
âA pool so deep.â
 The Teacher told this tale while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning an indistinguishable terrific sound heard at midnight by the king of Kosala. The occasion is like that already described in the LohakumbhijÄtaka [Ja 314].

The king of Kosala of those days, they say, one night heard a cry uttered by four inhabitants of hell â the syllables du, sa, na, so, one from each of the four. In a previous existence, tradition says, they had been princes in SÄvatthi, and had been guilty of adultery. After misconducting themselves with their neighboursâ wives, however carefully guarded they might be, and indulging their amorous propensities, their evil life had been cut short by the Wheel of Death, near SÄvatthi. They came to life again in Four Iron Cauldrons. After being tortured for sixty thousand years they had come up to the top, and on seeing the edge of the Cauldronâs mouth they thought to themselves, âWhen shall we escape from this misery?â And then all four uttered a loud cry, one after another. The king was terrified to death at the noise, and sat waiting for break of day, unable to stir.


At dawn the brahmins came and inquired after his health. The king replied, âHow, my masters, can I be well, who today have heard four such terrible cries.â The brahmins waved their hands. âWhat is it, my masters?â said the king. The brahmins assure him that the sounds are ominous of great violence. âDo they admit of remedy, or not?â said the king. âYou might say not,â said the brahmins, âbut we are well-trained in these matters, sire.â âBy what means,â said the king, âwill you avert these evils?â âSire,â they replied, âthere is one great remedy in our power, and by offering the fourfold sacrifice of every living creature we will avert all evil.â âThen be quick,â said the king, âand take all living creatures by fours â men, bulls, horses, elephants, down to quails and other birds â and by this fourfold sacrifice restore my peace of mind.â The brahmins consented, and taking whatever they required, they dug a sacrificial pit and fastened their numerous victims to their stakes, and were highly excited at the thought of the dainties they were to eat, and the wealth they would gain, and went about backwards and forwards, saying: âSir, I must have so and so.â


The queen MallikÄ came and asked the king, why the brahmins went about so delighted and smiling. The king said: âMy queen, what have you to do with this? You are intoxicated with your own glory, and you do not know how wretched I am.â âHow so, sire?â she replied. âI have heard such awful noises, my queen, and when I asked the brahmins what would be the result of my hearing these cries, they told me I was threatened with danger to my kingdom or my property or my life, but by offering the fourfold sacrifice they would restore my peace of mind, and now in obedience to my command, they have dug a sacrificial pit and are gone to fetch whatever victims they require.â The queen said: âHave you, my lord, consulted the chief brahmin in the Deva world as to the origin of these cries?â âWho, lady,â said the king, âis the chief brahmin in the Deva world?â âThe Great Gotama,â she replied, âthe Supreme Buddha.â âLady,â he said: âI have not consulted the Supreme Buddha.â âThen go,â she answered, âand consult him.â


The king hearkened to the words of the queen and after his morning meal he mounted his state chariot and drove to Jetavana. Here after saluting the Teacher he thus addressed him, âVenerable sir, in the night season I heard four cries and consulted the brahmins about it. They undertook to restore my peace of mind, by the fourfold sacrifice of every kind of victim, and are now busy preparing a sacrificial pit.â

At this time however, when the king said: âLord, what does the hearing of these sounds import to me?â the Teacher answered, âGreat king, be not afraid, no danger shall befall you owing to these sounds, such terrible indistinguishable 
[3.257]
 sounds have not been heard by you alone, kings of old also heard like sounds, and meant to follow the advice of brahmins to offer in sacrifice four animals of each species, but after hearing what wise men had to say, they set free the animals collected for sacrifice and caused proclamation by drum against all slaughter,â and at the kingâs request, he told a story of the past.

1. âA pool so deep and full of fish they called this place of yore,

The crane-kingâs residence it was, my ancestorsâ before,

And though we live on frogs today, we never leave its shore.â

2. âOh! Who of wicked Bandhura? The single eye will rend

My nest, my nestlings and myself, oh! who will now befriend?â 
{3.431}

3. âIâve eaten all the fig-wood round as far as it would go,

Hard wood a weevil likes it not, though other food runs low.â

4. âOh to leave this royal dwelling! Oh to gain my liberty,

Glad at heart to roam the wood, and build my nest upon the tree.â

5. âOh to leave this royal dwelling! Oh to gain my liberty,

Drink pure water of the fountain, lead the herd that followed me!â

6. âFilled and stained was I with passions, with desire infatuate,

Bharata the hunter took me; may I bring you happy fate!â

7. âWhen the darkness gathered thickly on the mountain summit lone,

Stumble not, she gently warned me, with your foot against a stone.â

8. âSurely I see the end of birth,

I neâer again the womb shall see,

My last existence on the earth

Is oâer, and all its misery.â

After the lesson, the Teacher said: âGreat king, there is no danger at all to you from that sound, stop the sacrifice and give all these creatures their lives,â and having caused proclamation to be made by drum that their lives were spared, he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the king was Änanda, the pupil was SÄriputta, and the ascetic was myself.â

âHere is a golden necklace.â
 
{3.435}
 The Teacher told this tale while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning a female servant of AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika. The story is that one feast-day, when she was going with a number of fellow-servants to a pleasure-garden, she asked her mistress Paá¹á¹alakkhaá¹adevÄ« for an ornament to wear.
 [3.261]


Her mistress gave her an ornament of her own, worth a hundred thousand pieces. She put it on and went along with the other servants to the pleasure-garden.


A certain thief coveted the ornament, and with the design of killing her and taking it he began talking to her, and in the garden he gave her fish, flesh and strong drink. âHe does it, I suppose, because he desires me,â she thought, and at evening when the others lay down to rest after their sports, she rose and went to him. He said: âMistress, this place is not private; let us go a little farther.â She thought, 
Omitting 
na,
 with other MSS.
 âAnything private can be done in this place, no doubt he must be anxious to kill me and take what I am wearing, Iâll teach him a lesson,â so she said: âTeacher, I am dry owing to the strong drink, get me some water,â and taking him to a well asked him to draw some water, showing him the rope and bucket. The thief let down the bucket. Then as he was stooping to draw up the water, the girl, who was very strong, pushed him hard with both hands and threw him into the well. âYou wonât die that way,â she said, and threw a large brick upon his head. He died on the spot.


When she came back to the town and gave her mistress the ornament, she said: âI have very nearly been killed today for that ornament,â and told the whole story.


The mistress told AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika, and he told the TathÄgata. The Teacher said: âHouseholder, this is not the first time that servant girl has been endowed with wits rising to the occasion; she was so before also, it is not the first time she killed that man; she did it once before,â and at AnÄthapiá¹á¸ikaâs request, he told a story of the past.

1. âHere is a golden necklace, and emeralds and pearls,

Take all and welcome, give me place among your servant girls.â

2. âFair lady, lay your jewels down and do not weep so sore,

Iâll kill you, else I canât be sure youâll give me all your store,â

3. âWithin my years of sense, within my conscious memory,

No man on earth, I do protest, have I loved more than you.


4. Come hither, for my last salute, receive my last embrace,

For never more upon the earth shall we meet face to face.â

5. âWisdom at times is not confined to men

A woman can show wisdom now and then. 
[3.263]


6. Wisdom at times is not confined to men,

Women are quick in counsel now and then.


7. How quick and keen she was the way to know,

She slew him like a deer with full-stretched bow.


8. He that to great occasion fails to rise

Falls, like that dull thief from the precipice.


9. One prompt a crisis in his fate to see,

Like her, is saved from threatening enemy.â

After the lesson, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the two then were the same two now, the deity was myself.â

âConscious of an angry frown.â
 The Teacher told this tale while dwelling at Jetavana, concerning the admonition of a king. On this occasion the Teacher, at the kingâs request, told a story of the past.

1. âConscious of an angry frown,

Neâer let king stretch out his rod,

Things unworthy of a crown

Then would follow from his nod.


2. Conscious of a milder mood,

Let him judgments harsh decree,

When the case is understood,

Fix the proper penalty,


3. Self nor others will he vex,

Clearly parting right from wrong,

Though his yoke is on menâs necks,

Virtue holds him high and strong.


4. Princes reckless in their deed

Ply the rod remorselessly,

Ill repute is here their meed,

Hell awaits them when they die. 
{3.442}


5. They who love the saintly law,

Pure in deed and word and thought,

Filled with kindness, calm and awe,

Pass through both worlds as they ought.


6. King am I, my peopleâs lord;

Anger shall not check my bent,

When to vice I take the sword,

Pity prompts the punishment.â 
{3.443}

7. âSuch your glory and your power;

Neâer resign them for an hour,

Free from anger, free from fears,

Reign in joy a hundred years.


8. Prince, whom all those virtues bless,

Mild and bland, but firm in worth,

Rule the world with righteousness,

Pass to heaven when freed from earth.


9. True in word, in action good,

Take the means your end to gain,

Calm the troubled multitude,

As a cloud with genial rain.â 
{3.444}

After the lesson connected with the admonition of the Kosala king, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the Paccekabuddha passed into NibbÄna, Sumaá¹gala was Änanda, the king was myself.â

## Full Story
âThe earthâs like coals.â
 
[3.266]
 The Teacher told this tale while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning the keeping of the weekly fast days. One day the Teacher was addressing the laymen who were keeping the fast days and said: âLaymen, your conduct is good; when men keep the fast days they should give alms, keep the moral precepts, never show anger, feel kindness and do the duties of the day, wise men of old gained great glory from even a partial keeping of the fast days,â and at their request he told a story of the past.

1. âThe earthâs like coals, the ground like embers hot,

You sing your song, the great heat burns you not.


2. The sun on high, the sands below are hot,

You sing your song, the great heat burns you not.â

3. â âTis these desires that burn, and not the sun,

âTis all these pressing tasks that must be done.â 
{3.448}

4. âI have seen your roots, Desire, in a manâs own will they lie.

I will no more wish for you, and you, Desire, shall die.â

5. âLittle desire is not enough, and much but brings us pain,

Ah! Foolish men, be sober, friends, if you would wisdom gain.â

6. âLittle desire has brought me all the fruit,

Great is the glory Udaya acquires;

Mighty the gain if one is resolute

To be one gone forth and forsake desires.â 
{3.451}

7. âPenance forsooth makes men forsake their wrongs,

Their barberâs, potterâs, stations every one,

Through penance Gaá¹gamÄla glory wins,

And Brahmadatta now he calls my son.â 
{3.453}

8. âLo! How, eâer his death befall,

Meekness brings a man its fruit!

One who bowed before us all,

Kings and lords must now salute.â

9. âScorn not Gaá¹gamÄla so,

Perfect in dispensationâs ways,

He has crossed the waves of woe,

Free from sorrow now he strays.â

After the lesson the Teacher said: âLaymen, you see how keeping the fast is proper to be done,â and he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the Paccekabuddha entered into NibbÄna, king Aá¸á¸hamÄsaka was Änanda, the chief queen was the mother of RÄhula, king Udaya was myself.â

âInjured Dhamma can injure sorely.â
 The Teacher told this tale while dwelling at Jetavana, concerning Devadattaâs being swallowed up by the earth.


On that day they were discussing in the Dhamma Hall how Devadatta had spoken 
[3.272]
 falsely, had sunk into the ground and become destined to the hell AvÄ«ci. The Teacher came and, hearing the subject of their talk, said: âThis is not the first time he sank into the earth,â and so he told a story of the past.

1. âInjured Dhamma injures sorely, and requite with injury;

Thus Dhamma should neâer be injured, lest the harm recoil on you.â 
{3.457}

2. âThe powers divine forsake and leave the man who tells a lie,

Ill smells his mouth, he cannot keep his foothold in the sky,

3. âA word of truth, and all your gifts, O king, you shall regain,

A lie will fix you in the soil of Ceti to remain.â

Whoeâer to questioning replies with falsehood wilfully.


7. One word of truth, and all your gifts, O king, you shall regain,

A lie will sink you deeper still in Ceti to remain.â

8. âO king, that man is like a fish, and tongueless he shall be,

Whoeâer to questioning replies with falsehood wilfully.


9. One word of truth, and all your gifts, O king, you shall regain,

A lie will sink you deeper still in Ceti to remain.â

10. âGirls only shall be born of him, no male child shall he see,

Whoeâer to questioning replies with falsehood wilfully.


11. One word of truth, and all your gifts, O king, you shall regain,

A lie will sink you deeper still in Ceti to remain.â

12. âHis children will not stay with him, on every side they flee,

Whoeâer to questioning replies with falsehood wilfully. 
[3.275]


13. One word of truth, and all your gifts, O king, you shall regain,

A lie will sink you deeper still in Ceti to remain.â

14. âCursed by a sage, the king who once could walk the air, they say,

Was lost and swallowed by the earth on his appointed day.


15. Wherefore the wise do not approve at all

When that desire into the heart does fall,

He that is free from guile, whose heart is pure,

All that he says is ever firm and sure.â

After the lesson, the Teacher said: âSo, monks, this is not the first time that Devadatta has told a lie and sunk in the earth,â and then he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the king of Ceti was Devadatta, and the brahmin Kapila was myself.â

## Full Story
âWho through desire.â
 The Teacher told this tale while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning temptation by the wife of oneâs former days. The story is that a young man of good family at SÄvatthi heard the Teacherâs preaching, and thinking it impossible to lead a holy life, perfectly complete and pure, as a householder, he determined to become an ascetic in the dispensation which leads to safety and so make an end of misery. So he gave up his house and property to his wife and children, and asked the Teacher to ordain him. The Teacher did so. As he was the junior in his going about for alms with his teachers and instructors, and as the monks were many, he got no chair either in laymenâs houses or in the refectory, but only a stool or a bench at the end of the novices, his food was tossed him hastily on a ladle, he got gruel made of broken lumps of rice, solid food stale or decaying, or sprouts dried and burnt; and this was not enough to keep him alive. 
{3.462}
 He took what he had got to the wife he had left, she took his bowl, saluted him, emptied it and gave him instead well-cooked gruel and rice with sauce and curry.


The monk was captivated by the love of such flavours and could not leave his wife. She thought she would test his affection. One day she had a countryman cleansed with white clay and set down in her house with some others of his people whom she had sent for, and she gave them something to eat and drink. They sat eating and enjoying it. At the house-door she had some bullocks bound to wheels and a cart set ready. She herself sat in a back room cooking cakes. Her husband came and stood at the door. Seeing him, one old servant told his mistress that there was an elder at the door. âSalute him and bid him pass on.â


But though he did so repeatedly, he saw the monk remaining there and told his mistress. She came, and lifting up the curtain to see, she cried, âThis is the father of my sons.â She came out and saluted him, taking his bowl and making him enter she gave him food, when he had eaten she saluted again and said: âSir, you are a saint now, we have been staying in this house all this time; but there can be no proper householderâs life without a master, so we will take another house and go far into the country, be zealous in your good works, and forgive me if I am doing wrong.â For a time her husband was as if his heart would break. Then he said: âI cannot leave you, do not go, I will come back to my worldly life, send a laymanâs garment to such and such a place, I will give up my bowl and robes and come back to you.â She agreed. The monk went to his monastery, and giving up his bowl and robes to his teachers and instructors he explained, in answer to their questions, that he could not leave his wife and was going back to worldly life.


Against his will they took him to the Teacher and told him that he was discontent and wished to go back to worldly life. The Teacher said: âIs this tale true?â âIt is, Lord.â âWho causes you to fall back?â âMy wife.â âMonk, that woman is the cause of evil to you, formerly also through her you fell from the four stages of Absorption 
[3.277]
 and became very miserable, then through me you were delivered from your misery and regained the power of meditation you had lost,â and then he told a story of the past. 
{3.463}

1. âWho through desire obeys the sensesâ sway,

Loses both worlds and pines his life away.â 
[3.278]

2. âHappiness and misery ever on each otherâs footsteps press,

You have seen their alternation, seek a truer happiness.â 
{3.465}

3. âHe who endures in troubled time with troubles to contend

Is strong to reach that final bliss where all our troubles end.â

4. âFor love of sensual desires, for hopes of gain, for miseries, great and small,

Do not undo your saintly past, and so from virtue fall.â

5. âKnow 
The Commentator takes 
sÄdhu
 with all the clauses, the meaning then would be: Good are the cares of household life, âtis good to give away, Not to be proud when riches grow, nor grieved when they decay.
 the worldly life is trouble, victual should be freely lent.

No delight in gathering riches, no distress when they are spent.â

6. âSo far Black 
Both 
kÄá¸·o
 and 
asito
 mean 
black
: this person is the Asita, the Simeon of the Buddhist nativity; cf. vol. i. 54.
 Devala most wisely spoke,

None worse than he who bows to sensesâ yoke.â 
{3.467}

7. âKing, âtis with me as if Iâd been with foes in bitter strife,

Labour, and skill in handicraft, a peaceful home, a wife,

All have been lost to me, my works bear fruit in this my life.


8. Worsted a thousandfold I am, kinless and reft of stay,

Strayed from the noble Dhamma, like ghost Iâm fallen away.


9. This state is mine because I caused, instead of joy, distress,

Girt as it were with flaming fire, I have no happiness.â {3.469}

After the lesson, the Teacher declared the Truths and identified the JÄtaka, After the Truths the discontented monk was established in the fruition of the First Path. âAt that time NÄrada was the discontented monk, SÄlissara was SÄriputta, Meá¹á¸issara was Kassapa, Pabbata was Anuruddha, KÄá¸·adevala was KaccÄna, Anusissa was Änanda, Kisavaccha was MoggallÄna, and Sarabhaá¹ga was myself.â

## Full Story
âWhateâer a man can save.â
 
[3.280]
 The Teacher told this tale while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning an incomparable gift. The incomparable gift must be described in full from the commentary on the MahÄgovindasutta [DN 19]. 
[I have translated and included the relevant passage here.]

It seems at one time almsfood arose in due order for the Fortunate One in RÄjagaha, SÄvatthi, SÄketa, KosambÄ«, BÄrÄá¹asÄ«, and therein, some said: âHaving spent a hundred pieces, I will give a gift,â and having written it on a leaf, it was pinned to the door of the monastery. Others said: âI will give two hundred.â Others said: âI will give five hundred.â Others said: âI will give a thousand.â Others said: âI will give two thousand.â Others said: âI will give five, ten, twenty, fifty.â Others said: âI will give a hundred thousand.â Others said: âI will give two hundred thousand,â and having written it on a leaf, it was pinned to the door of the monastery. Receiving the opportunity while the Buddha was walking on a walk through the countryside, they said: âI will give a gift,â and after filling their carts, the countryfolk followed along.


They spoke like this, âAt that time the people of the country after filling the carts with salt, oil, rice and sweetmeats, followed along close behind the Fortunate One, saying, âIn due order wherever we can get an opportunity, there we will give them food,â and everything is to be understood as in the story in the Khandhakas of the Vinaya. Just so was the unmatched gift achieved.


Having walked on a walk through the countryside, at that time it seems the Fortunate One arrived at Jetavana, and the king invited him and gave a gift. On the second day the city folk gave a gift. But their gift was greater than the kingâs, and then next day his was greater than the city folks,â thus after a number of days had passed the king thought: âThese city folk day by day give exceedingly, if the lord of the earth, the king, is defeated by the gifts of the city folk, he will be blamed.â Then queen MallikÄ told a skilful means to him.


Having made a pavilion with beautiful boards in the royal courtyard, and covered it with blue lotuses, having arranged five hundred seats, and placed five hundred elephants in front of the seats, each elephant held a white parasol over each of the monks. And two by two on the side of the seats, adorned with all decorations, young noblewomen ground up the four kinds of incense. At the conclusion she placed a measure of incense in the middle, while the other noblewoman rolled it with the hand holding the blue lotuses. Thus each monk was surrounded by noblewomen, and other women, adorned with all decorations, who, having taken a fan, were fanning them, and others, who having taken a water strainer, strained the water, and others who took away the fallen water.


For the Fortunate One there were four invaluable things, a foot stand, a stool, a bolster, and a jewelled parasol, these were the four invaluable things.


The gifts for the last to come in the Saá¹gha were valued at a hundred thousand. The elder Aá¹gulimÄla was last to come in that ceremony. No one was able to lead an elephant close to his seat, therefore they informed the king. The king said: âIsnât there another elephant?â âThere is a rogue elephant, but no one is able to lead him.â The Perfect Sambuddha said: âWho is the last to come, great king?â âThe elder Aá¹gulimÄla, Fortunate One.â âHaving led the rogue elephant, place him next to him, great king.â After decorating him, they led him to the elder Aá¹gulimÄla. Through the power of that elder the elephant was unable to move even the air in his trunk.


Thus the king gave gifts for seven days. On the seventh day, after worshipping the One of Ten Powers, the king said: âPlease teach Dhamma to me, Fortunate One.â Among that assembly were two ministers, KÄá¸·a (Dark) and Juá¹ha (Bright). KÄá¸·a thought: âThe kingâs property is diminished, why did these people accept so much, having eaten, and gone to the monastery, they are sleeping! But the kingâs men, if they had received something, what would they not do for him? Alas, the kingâs property is diminished!â Juá¹ha thought: âKingship is known as a great thing, who else will do as he has? Why is the king known as such, he who abides in kingship, such a gift no one else is able to give.â


The Fortunate One inspecting the dispositions of that assembly and knew the dispositions of these two, âIf today I teach Dhamma, Juá¹haâs disposition will prosper, but KÄá¸·aâs head will split into seven. But through my compassion for beings the Perfections are already fulfilled. On another day, teaching Dhamma to Juá¹ha, he will penetrate the path and fruit, but I will consider KÄá¸·a in this,â and he spoke just one four line verse to the king,

âThe miserly go not to the world of the gods,

fools surely do not praise giving,

but the wise one rejoices in giving,

and through that he is happy hereafter.â

The king was disappointed, thinking: âA great gift was given by me, but the teacher only taught a very little Dhamma, I think I was not able to please the One of Ten Powersâ mind.â Having gone to the monastery after the morning meal, and worshipped the Fortunate One, he asked, âA great gift was given by me, Fortunate One, but you did not rejoice greatly with me, are you angry with me, venerable sir?â âThere is no anger, great king, but the assembly was not pure, therefore I did not teach much Dhamma.â âBut why, Fortunate One, was the assembly not pure?â The Teacher informed him of the thoughts of the two ministers.


The king asked KÄá¸·a, saying: âIs it so, KÄá¸·a?â âYes, great king.â âMy property was given by me, what of yours was ruined it is not possible for me to see, get out of my country!â


Then, having called Juá¹ha, he asked, âDear, was your thought thus?â âYes, great king.â âThese are suitable thoughts for you! Therefore having established in this pavillion seats for five hundred monks, and having gathered the noblewomen together, and taken the wealth of all RÄjagaha, give gifts for seven days similar to my gifts.â He gave gifts in just that way.


Having given for seven days, he said: âFortunate One, please teach Dhamma.â The Teacher rejoiced over these double gifts, and after collaborating and making these two streams of merit flow like a great river, he taught a great Dhamma teaching. At the end of the teaching Juá¹ha became a Stream-Enterer.

On the day after that on which it had been given, they were talking of it in the Dhamma Hall, âSirs, the Kosala king 
{3.470}
 after examination found the proper field of merit, and gave the great gift to the assembly with Buddha at its head.â The Teacher came and was told what the subject of their talk was as they sat together, he said: âMonks, it is not strange that the king after examination has undertaken great gifts to the supreme field of merit, wise men of old also after examination gave such gifts,â and so he told a story of the past.

1. âWhateâer a man can save from flames that burn his dwelling down,

Not what is left to be consumed, will still remain his own.


2. The worldâs on fire, decay and death are there the flame to feed;

Save what you can by generosity, a gift is saved indeed.â 
{3.472}

3. âHe who gives to righteous men,

Strong in holy energy,

Crosses Yamaâs flood, and then

Gains a dwelling in the sky.â


4. âLike to war is generosity,

Hosts may flee before a few,

Give a little piously,

Bliss hereafter is your due.â


5. âPrudent givers please the lord,

Worthily they spend their toil.

Rich the fruit their gifts afford,

Like a seed in fertile soil.â


6. âThey who never rudely speak,

Wrong to living things abjure,

Men may call them timid, weak,

For âtis fear that keeps them pure.â


7. âLower duties win for man, reborn on earth, a princely fate,

Middle duties win them heaven, highest win the Purest State.â 
The higher heavens in the Buddhist Cosmogony.
 
[3.282]


8. âGenerosity is blessed indeed, 
{3.473}

Yet Dhamma gains higher meed,

Ages old and late attest,

Thus the wise have reached their rest.â

After the lesson, the Teacher said: âSo wise men of old gave gifts with discrimination,â and identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the Paccekabuddha reached NibbÄna, SamuddavijayÄ was the mother of RÄhula, and the king Bharata was myself.â

âMake Ganges calm.â
 The Teacher told this tale while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning a discontented monk. The Teacher asked him, âIs the story true, monk, that you are discontent?â âYes, lord.â âWhat is the cause?â âThe power of desire.â âMonk, womankind are ungrateful, treacherous, and untrustworthy. In olden days wise men could not satisfy a woman, even by giving her a thousand pieces a day, and one day when she did not get the thousand pieces she had them taken by the neck and cast out, 
{3.475}
 so ungrateful are womankind, do not fall into the power of desire for such a cause,â and so he told a story of the past.

1. âMake Ganges calm like lotus-tank, cuckoos pearl-white to see,

Make apples bear the palm treesâ fruit, perchance it then might be.â

2. âWhen woven out of turtle-hair a triple cloth you see,

For winter wear against the cold, perchance it then may be.


3. When of mosquitoâs teeth you build a tower so skilfully,

That will not shake or totter soon, perchance it then may be.


4. When out of horns of hare you make a ladder skilfully,

Stairs that will climb the height of heaven, perchance it then may be.


5. When mice to mount those ladder-stairs and eat the moon agree,

And bring down RÄhu from the sky, the thing perchance may be.


6. When swarms of flies devour strong drink in pitchers full and free,

And house themselves in burning coals, the thing perchance may be.


7. When asses get them ripe red lips and faces fair to see,

And show their skill in song and dance, the thing perchance may be.


8. When crows and owls shall meet to talk in converse privily,

And woo each other, lover-like, the thing perchance may be. 
{3.478}


9. When sunshades, made of tender leaves from off the forest tree,

Are strong against the rushing rain, the thing perchance may be.


10. When sparrows take HimÄlayas in all its majesty,

And bear it in their little beaks, the thing perchance may be.


11. And when a boy can carry light, with all its bravery,

A ship full-rigged for distant seas, the thing perchance may be.â

After the lesson, the Teacher said: âSo, monks, womankind are ungrateful and treacherous,â then he declared the Truths, and identified the JÄtaka, After the Truths, the discontented monk was established in the fruition of the First Path. âAt that time the king was Änanda, the ascetic was myself.â

âHow fares it with you.â
 
[3.285] {3.479}
 The Teacher told this tale while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning a certain female goat. At one time the elder MoggallÄna lived in a dwelling with one door, in a mountain enclosure, surrounded by hills. His covered walk was close by the door. Some goatherds thought the enclosure would be a good place for their goats, so they drove them in and lived there at their pleasure. One day they came in the evening, took all the goats, and went away, but one female goat had wandered far, and not seeing the goats departing, she was left behind. Later, as she was departing, a certain panther saw her, and thinking to eat her stood by the door of the enclosure. She looked all round, and saw the panther. âHe is there because he wishes to kill and eat me,â she thought, âif I turn and run, my life is lost; I must play the man,â and so she tossed her horns, and sprang straight at him with all her might. She escaped his grip, though he was quivering with the thought of catching her, then running at full speed she came up with the other goats. The elder observed how all the animals had behaved, next day he went and told the TathÄgata, âSo, lord, this female goat performed a feat by her skill in means, and escaped from the panther.â The Teacher answered, âMoggallÄna, the panther failed to catch her this time, but once before he killed her though she cried out, and ate her.â Then at MoggallÄnaâs request, he told a story of the past.

1. âHow fares it with you, uncle? Is it well with you?

My mother sends her kind regards, Iâm your friend so true.â

2. âYouâve trod upon my tail, miss goat, and done me injury,

And you think by saying âuncleâ that you can go scot-free.â 
[3.286]

3. âI faced you as I came, good sir, you face me as you sit,

Your tail is all behind you, how could I tread on it?â

4. âAs far as four great continents with seas and mountains spread,

My tail extends, how could you fail on such a tail to tread?â

5. âYour villainâs tail is long, I know, for I had warning fair,

Parents and brothers told me so, but I flew through the air.â

6. âThe sight of you, miss goat, on high, the air flying through,

Frightened a herd of deer, and so my food was spoilt by you.â

7. â âTwas thus the female goat cried for grace, but blood must satisfy

The beast that grips her throat; the bad will show no courtesy.


8. Conduct, nor right, nor courtesy, the bad man will display;

He hates the good, to face him then âtis best in open fray.â

After this lesson, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the female goat and the panther were the female goat and the panther of today, the holy ascetic was myself.â

 This story the Teacher told at Jetavana concerning a disobedient monk. He was, they say, of gentle birth, and though ordained in the dispensation that leads to safety, was admonished by his well-wishers, masters, teachers, and fellow-students to this effect, âThus must you advance and thus retreat; thus look at or away from objects; thus must the arm be stretched out or drawn back; thus are the inner and outer garment to be worn; thus is the bowl to be held, and when you have received sufficient food to sustain life, after self-examination, thus are you to partake of it, keeping guard over the door of the senses; in eating you are to be moderate and exercise watchfulness; you are to recognize such and such duties towards monks who come to or go from the monastery; these are the fourteen

 sets of monastic duties, and the eighty great duties to be duly performed; these are the thirteen ascetic practices; all these are to be scrupulously performed.â Yet was he disobedient and impatient, and did not receive instruction respectfully, but refused to listen to them, saying: âI do not find fault with you. Why do you speak thus to me? I shall know what is for my good, and what is not.â


Then the monks, hearing of his disobedience, sat in the Dhamma Hall, telling of his faults. The Teacher came and asked them what it was they were discussing, and sent for the monk and said: âIs it true, monk, that you are disobedient?â And when he confessed that it was so, the Teacher said: âWhy, monk, after being ordained in so excellent a dispensation that leads to safety, 
{3.484}
 do you not listen to the voice of your well-wishers? Formerly too you disobeyed the voice of the wise, and were blown into atoms by the Veramba wind.â And herewith he told a story of the past.

1. âFormed of rough logs, an ancient pathway led

To dizzy heights, where a young vulture fed


2. The parent birds. Lusty and strong of wing

He oft to them would fat of serpents bring;


3. And when his father saw him flying high

And venturing far afield, he thus would cry,


4. âMy son, when you can scan from your lookout

Earthâs rounded sphere by ocean girt about,

No farther go, but straight return, I pray.â


5. Then would this king of birds speed on his way,

And bending oâer the earth, with piercing sight

He viewed below forest and mountain height:


6. And earth would, as his sire described, appear

Amid the encircling sea a rounded sphere.

But when beyond these limits he had passed,


7. Strong bird though he might be, a raging blast

Swept him away to an untimely death,

Powerless to cope with storm-windâs fiery breath. 
{3.485}


8. Thus did the bird by disobedience prove

Fatal to those dependent on his love:


9. So perish all that, scornful of old age,

Deride the warnings uttered by the sage,

As the young vulture wisdomâs voice defied

And scorned the limits set to bound his pride.â 
{3.486}

The Teacher, his lesson ended, identified the JÄtaka, âThe disobedient vulture of those days is now the disobedient monk. The parent vulture was myself.â

In the present two sets of monks fall into a dispute over a disciplinary matter, and although rebuked by the Buddha continue with it. The Buddha tells a story of a prince who forgave his fatherâs killer, and then admonishes the monks to behave at least as well as their royal predecessor. 
[This JÄtaka is very unusual, as the story of the past is summarised in one paragraph, whereas the story laying the basis forms most of the JÄtaka, including the verses.]

## Full Story
âWheneâer the Saá¹gha.â
 
[3.289]
 This story the Teacher, while dwelling in the Ghosita park near KosambÄ«, told concerning certain quarrelsome folk at KosambÄ«. The incident that led to the story is to be found in The Section with the Vinaya relating to KosambÄ«. 
MahÄvagga,
 x. 1-10.
 Here is a short summary of it. At that time, it is said, two monks lived in the same house, the one versed in the Vinaya, the other in the Suttas. The latter of these one day having occasion to visit the lavatory went out leaving the surplus water for rinsing the mouth in a vessel. Afterwards the one versed in the Vinaya went in and seeing the water came out and asked his companion if the water had been left there by him. He answered, âYes, sir.â âWhat! Do you not know that this is wrong?â âNo, I was not aware of it.â âWell, monk, it is wrong.â âThen I will atone for it.â âBut if you did it inadvertently and heedlessly, it is not wrong.â So he became as one who saw no wrong in what was wrongful.


The Vinaya scholar said to his pupils, âThis Sutta scholar, though falling into wrong, is not aware of it.â They on seeing the other monkâs pupils said: âYour master though falling into wrong does not recognize its wrongfulness.â They went and told their master. He said: âThis Vinaya scholar before said it was no wrong, and now he says it is wrong: he speaks falsely.â They went and told the others, âYour master speaks falsely.â Thus they stirred up a quarrel, one with another. Then the Vinaya scholar, finding an opportunity, went through the form of suspension of the monk for refusing to see his offence. Thenceforth even the laymen who provided necessaries for the monks were divided into two factions. The nuns too that accept their admonitions, and tutelary gods, with their friends and intimates and deities from those that rest in space 
These include all gods except those in the four highest heavens 
(arÅ«pa-brahmalokas)
. 
 
{3.487}
 to those of the Brahma World, even all such as were unconverted, formed two parties, and the uproar reached to the abode of the Akaniá¹­á¹­ha gods.


Then a certain monk drew near to the TathÄgata, and announced the view of the suspending side who said: âThe man is legally suspended,â and the view of the followers of the suspended one, who said: âHe is illegally suspended,â and the practice of those who though forbidden by the suspending side, still gathered round in support of him. The Fortunate One said: âThere is a schism, yes, a schism in the Saá¹gha,â and he went to them and pointed out the misery involved in suspension to those that suspended, and the misery following upon the concealment of the wrong to the opposite party, and so departed.


Again when they were holding the Uposatha and similar services in the same place, within the boundary, and were quarrelling in the refectory and elsewhere, he laid down the rule that they were to sit down together, one by one from each side alternately. And hearing that they were still quarrelling in the monastery he went there and said: âEnough, monks, let us have no quarrelling.â And one of the heretical side, 
Reading 
adhammavÄdinÄ
 as in the parallel passage of the 
MahÄvagga,
 p. 341.
 not wishing to annoy the Fortunate One, said: âLet the Fortunate One, the master of the Dhamma, dwell quietly at ease, enjoying the bliss he has already obtained in this life. We shall make ourselves notorious by this quarrelling, altercation, disputing and contention.â 
[3.290]

Since such must have been the long-suffering and tenderness of these sceptred and sword-bearing kings, verily, monks, you ought to make it clear that you too, having embraced the ascetic life according to so well-taught a Dhamma and Discipline, can be forgiving and tender-hearted.â And thus admonishing them for the third time he said: âEnough, monks, let there be no quarrelling.â


When he saw that they did not cease at his bidding, he went away, saying: âVerily, these foolish folk are like men possessed, they are not easy of persuasion.â Next day returning from the collection of alms he rested awhile in his perfumed chamber, and put his room in order, and then taking his bowl and robe he stood poised in the air and delivered these verses in the midst of the assembly: 
{3.488}

1. âWhenever the Saá¹gha in twain is rent, 
[All of these verse are quoted as a group in MN 128 
Upakkilesasutta
,.]

The common folk to loud-mouthed cries give vent:

Each one believes that he himself is wise,

And views his neighbour with disdainful eyes.


2. Bewildered souls, puffed up with self-esteem,

With open mouth they foolishly blaspheme;

And as through all the range of speech they stray,

They know not whom as leader to obey.


3. This 
Dhp v. 3-5. See also No. 371 
supra.
 man abused me, that struck me a blow,

A third oâercame and robbed me long ago.

All such as harbour feelings of this kind,

To mitigate their wrath are neâer inclined.


4. He did abuse and buffet me of yore

He overcame me and oppressed me sore.

They who such thoughts refuse to entertain,

Appease their wrath and live at one again.


5. Not hate, but love alone makes hate to cease:

This is the everlasting law of peace.


6. Some men the law of self-restraint despise,

But who make up their quarrels, they are wise.


7. If men all scarred with wounds in deadly strife,

Robbers of cattle, taking human life,

Nay those that plunder a whole realm, may be

Friends with their foes, should monks not agree?


8. Should you 
[The last three verse are also found at Dhp. 328-330.]
 a wise and honest comrade find,

A kindred soul, to dwell with you inclined,

All dangers past, with him you still would stray,

In happy contemplation all the day.


9. But should you fail to meet with such a friend,

Your life âtwere best in solitude to spend,

Like to some prince that abdicates a throne,

Or elephant that ranges all alone.


10. For choice adopt the solitary life,

Companionship with fools but leads to strife;

In careless innocence pursue your way,

Like elephant in forest wild astray.â 
{3.489}

When the Teacher had thus spoken, as he failed to reconcile these monks, he went to BÄlakaloá¹akÄragÄma (the village of BÄlaka, the salt-maker), 
[3.291]
 and discoursed to the venerable Bhagu of the blessings of solitude. Thence he repaired to the abode of three youths of gentle birth and spoke to them of the bliss to be found in the sweets of concord. Thence he journeyed to the PÄrileyyaka forest, 
{3.490}
 and after dwelling there three months, without returning to KosambÄ«, he went straight to SÄvatthi. And the lay folk of KosambÄ« consulted together and said: âSurely these venerable monks of KosambÄ« have done us much harm; worried by them the Fortunate One is gone away. We will neither offer salutation nor other marks of respect to them, nor give alms to them when they visit us. So they will depart, or return to the world, or will propitiate the Fortunate One.â And they did so. And these monks overwhelmed by this form of punishment went to SÄvatthi and begged forgiveness of the Fortunate One.


The Teacher thus identified the JÄtaka, âThe father was the great king Suddhodana, the mother was MahÄmÄyÄ, 
[Neither of which are actually mentioned in the JÄtaka.]
 prince DÄ«ghÄvu was myself.â

## Full Story
âWherever fruitful trees.â
 This story the Teacher dwelling at Jetavana told concerning a certain monk. The story goes that he lived in a forest near a border village in the Kosala country, and received instruction in forms of meditation from the Teacher. The people made him a dwelling-place on a site where men continually passed to and fro, providing him with day and night quarters, and attentively ministered to him. In the very first month after he had entered upon the rainy season the village was burned down and the people had not so much as a seed left and were unable to supply his alms-bowl with savoury food; and though he was in a pleasant place of abode, he was so distressed for alms that he could not enter upon the Path or its Fruition. So when at the end of three months he went to visit the Teacher, after words of kindly greeting the Teacher hoped that though distressed for alms he had a pleasant place to live in. The monk told him how matters stood. The Teacher on hearing that he had pleasant quarters said: âMonk, if this is so, an ascetic ought to lay aside covetous ways, and be content to eat whatever food he can get, and to fulfil all the duties of a monastic. Sages of old when born into the world as animals, 
{3.491}
 though they lived on the powdered dust of the decayed 
[3.292]
 tree in which they had their abode, laid aside greedy desires and were contented to stay where they were, and fulfilled the law of love. Why then do you abandon a pleasant dwelling-place, because the food you receive is scanty and coarse?â And at his request the Teacher told a story of the past.

1. âWherever fruitful trees abound,

A flock of hungry birds is found:

But should the trees all withered be,

Away at once the birds will flee.â 
{3.492}

2. âHaste you, sir redbeak, to be gone;

Why do you sit and dream alone?

Come tell me, pray you, bird of spring,

To this dead stump why do you cling?â

3. âThey who have been close friends from youth,

Mindful of goodness and of truth,

In life and death, in weal and woe

The claims of friendship neâer forego.


4. I too would fain be kind and good

To one that long my friend has stood;

I wish to live, but have no heart

From this old tree, though dead, to part.â 
[3.293]

5. âI know your friendship and your grateful love,

Virtues that wise men surely must approve.


6. I offer you whateâer you will for choice;

Parrot, what boon would most your heart rejoice?â

7. âIf you, O goose, what most I crave would give,

Grant that the tree I love, again may live.

Let it once more with its old vigour shoot,

Gather fresh sweetness and bear goodly fruit.â

8. âLo! Friend, a fruitful and right noble tree,

Well fitted for your dwelling-place to be.

Let it once more with its old vigour shoot,

Gather fresh sweetness and bear goodly fruit.â 
{3.494}

9. âMay Sakka and all loved by Sakka blessÃ©d be,

As I today am blessed this goodly sight to see!â

10. âSoon as king parrot wisely made his choice,

The tree once more put forth its fruit again;

Then Sakka with his queen did fly amain

To where in Nandana the gods rejoice.â

The Teacher, his lesson ended, said: âThus, monk, sages of old though born in animal forms were free from covetousness. Why then do you, after being ordained under so excellent a dispensation, follow greedy ways? Go and dwell in the same place.â And he gave him a form of meditation, and the monk went back and by spiritual insight became an Arahat. He thus identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time Sakka was Anuruddha, and the parrot king was myself.â

When the Teacher after passing the rainy season at VeraÃ±jÄ in due course arrived at SÄvatthi, the monks in the Dhamma Hall raised a discussion saying: âSirs, a TathÄgata, a delicately nurtured noble and Buddha, though possessed of Supernormal Powers, at the invitation of a brahmin of VeraÃ±jÄ stayed three á¹onths with him, and when owing to the temptation of MÄra he failed to receive an alms at the hands of the brahmin, even for a single day, he gave up all covetous ways, and keeping in the same place for three months lived on water and a modicum of the ground flour of roots. 
{3.495}
 Oh the contented nature of TathÄgatas!â When the Teacher came and on inquiry learned the nature of their discussion he said: âIt is no marvel, monks, that a TathÄgata now has lost all covetousness, seeing that formerly when born in an animal form he forsook covetousness.â And hereupon he told a story of the past. The whole story is now to be related in detail in exactly the same way as in the preceding tale [Ja 429].

1. âLo! Countless trees are here, all green and fruitful see!

Why, parrot, do you cling to this poor withered tree?â


2. âLong years we have enjoyed the luscious fruit it bare,

And thoâ it now has none, it still should claim our care.â


3. âNor leaves nor fruit it yields, alas, the tree is dead:

Why blame your fellow-birds, that they should all have fled?â


4. âThey loved it for its fruit, and now that it has none,

Poor selfish fools! Their love and gratitude is gone.â


5. âYour gratitude I own, 
[Verses 5 and 6, and 9 and 10 correspond to verses in the previous 
JÄtaka
.]
 your true and constant love,

Sure virtue such as this the wise will aye approve.â


6. âI offer you, O bird, whateâer you will for choice;

Tell me, I pray, what boon would most your heart rejoice?â


7. âWould that this tree alight bear fresh leaves and fruit again;

I would be glad as they that treasure trove obtain.â


8. Then was the tree by Sakka with ambrosia sprinkled oâer,

And boughs sprang up with cooling shade, as lovely as before.


9. May Sakka and all loved by Sakka blessÃ©d be,

As I today am blessed this joyous sight to see.


10. Thus was the tree made fruitful by the parrotâs grateful choice,

And Sakka and his queen in groves of Nandana rejoice. 
{3.496}

The Teacher, his lesson ended, identified the JÄtaka, âIn those days Sakka was Anuruddha, the parrot king was myself.â

## Full Story
âFriend HÄrita.â
 
[3.295]
 This story the Teacher dwelling at Jetavana told concerning a discontented monk. Now this monk after seeing a smartly attired woman grew discontented and allowed his hair and nails to grow long, and wished to return to the world. And when he was brought against his will by his teachers and preceptors to the Teacher, and was asked by him, if it were true that he was discontent, and if so why, he said: âYes, your reverence, it is owing to the power of sinful passion, after seeing a beautiful woman.â 
{3.497}


The Teacher said: âDoing wrong, monk, is destructive of virtue, and insipid withal, and causes a man to be reborn in hell; and why should not this wrong prove your destruction? For the hurricane that smites Mount Sineru is not ashamed to carry off a withered leaf. But owing to this wrong men who walk according to knowledge and wisdom, and have acquired the five Super Knowledges and the eight Attainments, though they were great and holy men, being unable to fix their thoughts, fell away from Absorption.â And then he told a story of the past.

1. âFriend HÄrita, I oft have heard it said

A sinful life is by your reverence led;

I trust there is no truth in this report,

And you are innocent in deed and thought?â 
{3.499}

2. âIn evil ways, great king, as you have heard,

Caught by the worldâs delusive arts, I erred.â 
[3.297]

3. âVain is manâs deepest wisdom to dispel

The passions that within his bosom swell.â

4. âThere are four passions in this world, great king,

That in their power are over-mastering:

Lust, hate, excess and ignorance their name;

Wisdom can here no certain footing claim.â 
{3.500}

5. âEndowed with holiness and intellect

The saintly HÄrita wins our respect.â

6. âIll thoughts, with pleasant vices if combined,

Corrupt the sage to saintliness inclined.â

7. âThe beauty that from purest hearts does shine

Is marred by lust, born of this mortal frame;

Away with it, and blessings shall be thine,

And multitudes your wisdom shall proclaim.â

8. âSince blinding passions yield a bitter fruit,

All growth of lust I cut down to the root.â 
{3.501}

9. âThus HÄrita for truth right stoutly did contend,

And lust forsaking did to Brahma Realm ascend.â

And having after Fully Awakening spoken this verse, he declared the Truths and identified the JÄtaka. At the conclusion of the Truths the worldly-minded monk became an Arahat, âAt that time the king was Änanda, HÄrita was myself.â

## Full Story
âO PÄá¹­ala, by Ganges.â
 
[3.298]
 This story the Teacher dwelling at Jetavana told concerning a certain boy. He was, they say, the son of a householder at SÄvatthi, just seven years old, and skilled in recognizing footsteps. Now his father being minded to prove him went without his knowing it to a friendâs house. The boy, without even asking where his father had gone, by tracing his footsteps, came and stood before him. So his father one day asked him saying: âWhen I went off without telling you, how did you know where I was gone?â 
{3.502}
 âMy dear father, I recognized your footsteps. I am skilled in this way.â Then his father, to prove him, went out of his house after the early meal, and going into his next-door neighbourâs house, from it passed into another, and from this third house again returned to his own home, and thence made his way to the north gate, and passing out by it made a circuit of the city from right to left. And coming to Jetavana he saluted the Teacher and sat down to listen to the Dhamma. The boy asked where his father was, and when they said: âWe do not know,â by tracing his fatherâs steps, and starting from the next-door neighbourâs house he went by the same road by which his father had travelled to Jetavana, and after saluting the Teacher stood in the presence of his father, and when asked by him, how he knew that he had come here, he said: âI recognized your footsteps and following in your track came here.â The Teacher asked, âLay brother, what are you saying?â He answered, âYour reverence, this boy is skilled in knowing footsteps. To test him I came here in such and such a manner. Not finding me at home, by following in my footsteps, he arrived here.â âThere is no marvel,â said the Teacher, âin recognizing steps upon the ground. Sages of old recognized steps in the air,â and on being asked, he told a story of the past.

1. âO PÄá¹­ala, by Ganges swept away,

Famous in dance and, skilled in roundelay,

PÄá¹­ala, all hail! As you are borne along,

Sing me, I pray, some little snatch of song.â

2. âWherewith are sprinkled fainting souls in pain,

I straight am killed. My refuge proved my bane.â

3. âThat by which seeds do grow, man to sustain,

Has crushed my head. My refuge proved my bane.â

4. âThat which destroys the cold, and parches grain,

Consumes my limbs. My refuge proves my bane.â

5. âFood on which countless brahmins life sustain

Killed me outright. My refuge proved my bane.â

6. âWind that in June wise men by prayer would gain,

My limbs does break. My refuge proved my bane.â

7. âFlame issues from the tree where we have lain:

Scatter, you birds. Our refuge proves our bane.â

8. âA maiden fair, with wreath upon her head,

Fragrant with sandal oil, by me was led

A happy bride within my home to reign:

She drove me forth. My refuge proved my bane.â

9. âHe for whose birth I longed, nor longed in vain,

Drives me from home. My refuge proved my bane.â

10. âLet town and country folk assembled all give ear,

Lo! Water is ablaze. From safety cometh fear.


11. The plundered realm may well of king and priest complain;

Henceforth protect yourselves. Your refuge proves your bane.â 
[3.306] {3.514}

The Teacher, after relating this story to illustrate the Truths, said: âLay brother, there is nothing marvellous in recognizing footsteps on the earth: sages of old recognized them in the air,â and he identified the JÄtaka. At the conclusion of the Truths the lay brother and his son attained to fruition of the First Path, âIn those days the father was Kassapa, the youth skilled in footsteps was myself.â

## Full Story
âTwin pair of birds.â
 
{3.520}
 This story the Teacher dwelling at Jetavana told concerning a greedy monk. He was, it was said, greedy after the requisites and casting off all duties of master and pastor, entered SÄvatthi quite early, and after drinking excellent rice-gruel served with many a kind of solid food in the house of VisÄkhÄ, and after eating in the daytime various dainties, paddy, meat and boiled rice, not satisfied with this he went about thence 
[3.310]
 to the house of Culla AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika, and the king of Kosala, and various others.


So one day a discussion was raised in the Dhamma Hall concerning his greediness. When the Teacher heard what they were discussing, he sent for that monk and asked him if it were true that he was greedy. And when he said: âYes,â the Teacher asked, âWhy, monk, are you greedy? Formerly too through your greediness, not being satisfied with the dead bodies of elephants, you left Benares and wandering about on the bank of the Ganges, entered the HimÄlayas.â And hereupon he told a story of the past.

1. âTwin pair of birds in yellow dressed,

So joyous roaming to and fro;

What kind of birds do men love best?

This is what I would want to know.â 
{3.521}

2. âO bird, of human kind the pest,

We above other birds are blessed.

All lands with our devotion

MeghadÅ«ta,

 ring

And men and birds our praises sing.

Know then that ruddy geese are we,

And fearless wander oâer the sea.â 
By the word âseaâ the Ganges is here intended.

3. âWhat fruits upon the sea abound,

And whence may flesh for geese be found?

Say on what heavenly food you live,

Such beauty and such strength to give.â 
{3.522}

4. âNo fruits are on the sea to eat,

And whence should ruddy geese have meat?

Eelgrass plant, stripped of its skin,

Yields food without a taint of sin.â 
[3.311]

5. âI like not, goose, the words you use:

I once believed the food we choose

To nourish us, ought to agree

With what our outward form might be.


6. But now I doubt it, for I eat

Rice, salt, and oil, and fruit, and meat:

As heroes feast returned from fight,

So I too in good cheer delight.

But though I live on dainty fare,

My looks with yours may not compare.â 
{3.523}

7. âNot satisfied with fruit, or garbage found

Within the precincts of the charnel ground,

The greedy crow pursues in wanton flight

The casual prey that tempts his appetite.


8. But all that thus shall work their wicked will,

And for their pleasure harmless creatures kill,

Upbraided by their conscience pine away,

And see their strength and comeliness decay.


9. So happy beings that no creatures harm

In form gain vigour and in looks a charm,

For beauty surely be it understood

Depends not wholly on the kind of food.â 
{3.524}

The Teacher, his lesson ended, revealed the Truths and identified the JÄtaka. At the conclusion of the Truths the greedy monk attained to fruition of the Second Path, âIn those days the crow was the greedy monk, the female goose was the mother of RÄhula, the male goose myself.â

## Full Story
âIn lonesome forest.â
 This story the Teacher at Jetavana told about a youth who was tempted by a certain coarse maiden. The introductory story will be found in the Thirteenth Book in the CullanÄradajÄtaka [Ja 477]. 
[I include the Introductory story here, and part of the actual 
JÄtaka
, which is missing otherwise.]

There was then, we learn, a girl of about sixteen, daughter of a citizen of SÄvatthi, such as might bring good luck to a man, yet no man chose her. So her mother thought to herself, âThis my daughter is of full age, yet no one chooses her. I will use her as bait for a fish, and make one of those SÄkiyan ascetics come back to the world, and live upon him.â


At the time there was a young man of good birth living in SÄvatthi, who had given his heart to the dispensation and went forth. But from the time when he had received full ordination he had lost all desire for learning, and lived devoted to the adornment of his person.


The lay sister used to prepare in her house rice gruel, and other food hard or soft, and standing at the door, as the monks walked along the streets, looked out for someone who could be tempted by the craving for delicacies. Streaming by went a crowd of monks who upheld the Three Baskets, including the Abhidhamma and the Vinaya; but among them she saw none ready to rise to her bait. Among the figures with bowl and robe, preachers of the Dhamma with honey-sweet voice, moving like fleecy scud before the wind, she saw not one.


But at last she perceived a man approaching, the outer corners of his eyes anointed, hair hanging down, wearing an under-robe of fine cloth, and an outer robe shaken and cleansed, bearing a bowl coloured like some precious gem, and a sunshade after his own heart, a man who let his senses have their own way, his body much bronzed. âHere is a man I can catch!â thought she; and greeting him, she took his bowl, and invited him into the house. She found him a seat, and provided rice gruel and all the rest; then after the meal, begged him to make that house his resort in future. So he used to visit the house after that, and in course of time became intimate.


One day, the lay sister said in his hearing, âIn this household we are happy enough, only I have no son or son-in-law capable of keeping it up.â The man heard it, and wondering what reason she could have for so saying, in a little while he was as it were pierced to the heart. She said to her daughter, âTempt this man, and get him into your power.â So the girl after that time decked herself and adorned herself, and tempted him with all womenâs tricks and wiles. Then the man, being young and under the power of passion, thought in his heart, âI cannot now hold on to the Buddhaâs dispensation,â and he went to the monastery, and laying down bowl and robe, said to his spiritual teachers, âI am discontented.â


Then they conducted him to the Teacher, and said: âSir, this monk is discontented.â âIs this true which they say,â asked he, âthat you are discontented, monk?â âYes, sir, true it is.â âThen what made you so?â âA sensual girl, sir.â âMonk,â said he, âlong, long ago, when you were living in the forest, this same girl was a hindrance to your holiness, and did you great harm; then why are you again discontented on her account?â Then at the request of the monks he told a story of the past.

1. âIn lonesome forest one may well be pure,

âTis easy there temptation to endure;

But in a village with seductions rife,

A man may rise to a far nobler life.â

2. âThis doubt, 
[Verses 2-5 correspond to verses 1-4 in Ja 328. 6-8 are additional.]
 my father, solve for me, I pray;

If to some village from this wood I stray,

Men of what school of morals, or what sect

Shall I most wisely for my friends affect?â

3. âOne that can gain your confidence and love,

Can trust your word, and with you patient prove,


4. In thought and word and deed will neâer offend â

Take to your heart and cling to him as friend.


5. To men capricious as the monkey kind,

And found unstable, be not you inclined,


6. Though to some wilderness your lotâs confined. 
[3.313]

Eschew foul ways, eâen as you would keep clear


7-8. Of angry serpent, or as charioteer 
{3.526}

Avoids a rugged road. Sorrows abound

Wheneâer a man in follyâs train is found:


9. Consort not you with fools â my voice obey â

The foolâs companion is to grief a prey.â

The Teacher, his lesson ended, proclaimed the Truths and identified the JÄtaka. At the conclusion of the Truths the monk who longed for the world attained to fruition of the First Path, âIn those days the young ascetic was the worldly-minded monk, the maiden then is the maiden now, but the father was myself.â

âWhence come you, friends.â
 
[3.312]
 
{3.527}
 This story the Teacher, while dwelling at Jetavana, told of a worldly-minded monk. The Teacher, they say, asked him if it were true that he was hankering after the world, and on his confessing that it was so, he said: âWhy, monk, do you desire a woman? Verily woman is wicked and ungrateful. Of old Rakkhasas swallowed women, and though they guarded them in their belly, they could not keep them faithful to one man. How then will you be able to do so?â And hereupon he related a story of the past.

1. âWhence come you, friends?

Right welcome all you three!

Be pleased to rest with me awhile,

I pray: I trust you live at ease and happily;

âTis long since any of you passed this way.â

2. âIâve come to visit you alone today,

Nor does a creature bear me company.

Why do you then, O holy ascetic, say,

Whence come you, friends?

Right welcome, all you three.â 
[3.315]

3. âThyself and your dear wife are twain, be sure;

Enclosed within a box she lies secure:

Safe-guarded ever in your belly, she

With VÄyuâs son does sport her merrily.â

4. âThe Rakkhasa by the sword, greatly terrified,

And from his maw disgorged the box upon the ground; 
{3.530}

His wife, with lovely wreath adorned as if a bride,

With VÄyuâs son disporting merrily was found.â

5. âO stern ascetic, your clear vision saw

How low poor man, a womanâs slave, may sink;

As life itself thoâ guarded in my maw,

The wretch did play the wanton, as I think.


6. I tended her with care both day and night,

As forest ascetic cherishes a flame,

And yet she did wrong, beyond all sense of right:

To do with woman needs must end in shame.


7. I thought within my body, hid from sight,

She must be mine â but âWantonâ was her name â

And so she did wrong beyond all sense of right:

To do with woman needs must end in shame.


8. Man with her thousand wiles does vainly cope,

In vain he trusts that his defence is sure;

Like precipices down to Hell that slope,

Poor careless souls she does to doom allure.


9. The man that shuns the path of womankind

Lives happily and from all sorrow free;

He his true bliss in solitude will find,

Afar from woman and her treachery.â 
{3.531}

The Teacher, his lesson ended, proclaimed the Truths, and identified the JÄtaka. At the conclusion of the Truths the worldly-minded monk attained fruition of the First Path, âIn those days the ascetic with Supernormal Powers of sight was myself.â

## Full Story
âWhy thus does PÅ«timaá¹sa.â
 
{3.532}
 This was a story told by the Teacher while at Jetavana concerning the subjugation of the senses. For at one time there were many monks who kept no guard over the avenues of the senses. The Teacher said to the elder Änanda, âI must admonish these monks,â and owing to their want of self-restraint he called together the assembly of the monks, and seated in the middle of a richly-adorned couch he thus addressed them, âMonks, it is not right that a monk under the influence of personal beauty should set his affections on mental or physical attributes, for should he die at such a moment, he is reborn in hell and the like evil states; therefore set not your affections on material forms and the like. A monk ought not to feed his mind on mental and physical attributes. They who do so even in this present condition of things are utterly ruined. Therefore it is good, monks, that the eye of the senses should be touched as with a red-hot iron pin.â


And here he gave other details, adding, âThere is a time for you to regard beauty, and a time to disregard it: at the time of regarding it, regard it not under the influence of what is agreeable, but of what is disagreeable. Thus will you not fall away from your proper sphere. What then is this sphere of yours? Even the Four Ways of Mindfulness, the four Right Efforts, the four Supernormal Powers, the Noble Eight-fold Path, the nine Supermundane Attainments. If you walk in this your proper domain, MÄra will not find an entrance, but if you are subject to passion and regard things under the influence of personal beauty, like the jackal PÅ«timaá¹sa, you will fall away from your true sphere,â and with these words he related a story of the past.

1. âWhy thus does PÅ«timaá¹sa stare?

His look misliketh me:

Of such a friend one should beware,

And far away should flee.â

2. âVeá¹Ä«, my wife, seems dull of wit,

To boast of friends that she has made;

Left in the lurch she can but sit

And grieve, by Meá¸·aâs art betrayed.â 
[3.318]

3. âYou too, my lord, were hardly wise,

And, foolish creature, raised your head,

Staring about with open eyes,

Though feigning to be dead.â


4. âAt fitting times they that are wise

Know when to ope or close their eyes,

Who look at the wrong moment, will,

Like PÅ«timaá¹sa, suffer ill.â

5. âOur former friendship, goat, once more revive,

And come with well-filled bowl to us, I pray,

My lord I took for dead is still alive,

With kindly greeting visit him today.â

6. âOur former friendship to revive,

A well-filled bowl I gladly give:

With a big escort I shall come;

To feast us well, go hasten home.â

7. âWhat kind of escort will you bring,

That I am bid to feast you well?

The names of all remembering

To us, I pray you, truly tell.â

8. âHounds 
Maliya and Piá¹giya probably refer to the colour of the dogs; Caturaká¹£a is one of Yamaâs dogs in the Rigveda; Jambuka is a spirit in the train of Skanda.
 grey and tan, four-eyed one too,

With Jambuk form my escort true:

Go hurry home, and quick prepare

For all abundance of good fare.â 
[3.319] {3.536}

9. âDonât leave your house, or else I fear

Your goods will all soon disappear:

Iâll take your greeting to my lord;

Donât stir, nay, not another word!â

The Teacher here ended his lesson and identified the JÄtaka, âIn those days I was the divinity that dwelt there in an old forest tree.â

âYour harmless offspring.â
 This story the Teacher, while dwelling at Vulture Peak, told concerning the going about of Devadatta to slay him. It was at this time that they started a discussion in the Dhamma Hall, saying: âAlas, sirs, how shameless and base was Devadatta. Joining himself to AjÄtasattu, he formed a plot to kill the excellent and supreme Buddha, by the hiring of archers, the hurling of a rock, and the letting loose of NÄlÄgiri.â The Teacher came and inquired of the monks what they were discussing in their assembly, and on being told what it was said, 
{3.537}
 âNot only now, but formerly too, Devadatta went about to kill me, but now he cannot so much as frighten me,â and he related a story of the past.

1. âYour harmless offspring he did eat,

Though you did rice in plenty give;

Your teeth make in his flesh to meet,

Nor let the wretch escape alive.â

2. âFilth does his greedy soul, like nurseâs garb, besmear,

His person all is proof against my fangs, I fear.


3. Flaws by the base ingrate are everywhere espied,

Not by the gift of worlds can he be satisfied.â

 are you here,

And why with you does this good youth appear?

What need for urgency is here, I pray?

Quick, tell me truly and without delay.â 
{3.541}

5. âThe partridge, sire, our very worthy friend,

I doubt, today has come to a bad end:

This fellowâs antecedents make me fear

We may ill news of our good partridge hear.â

6. âWhat may the fellowâs antecedents be,

And what defilements he confessed to you,

To make you doubt that some misfortune may

Have fallen on the learned bird today?â

7. âAs pedlar through KÄliá¹ga land

Rough roads he travelled, staff in hand;

With acrobats he has been found,

And harmless beast in toils has bound;


8. With dicers too has often played,

And snares for little birds has laid;

In crowds with cudgel-sticks has fought,

And gain by measuring corn has sought:

False to his vows, in midnight fray

Wounded, he washed the blood away:

His hands he burned through being bold

To snatch at food too hot to hold. 
{3.542}


9. Such was the life I heard he led,

Such defilements upon his head,

And since we know the cow is dead,

And feathers midst his locks appear,

I greatly for friend partridge fear.â

The Teacher ended his lesson saying: âThus, monks, did Devadatta of old too go about to kill me,â and he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the ascetic was Devadatta, the lizard KisÄgotamÄ«, the tiger MoggallÄna, the lion SÄriputta, the world-renowned teacher Kassapa, and the learned partridge was myself.â

âFour gates.â
 
[4.1] {4.1}
 This story the Teacher told at Jetavana, about a certain unruly person. The circumstances have already been set forth in the first JÄtaka of the Ninth Book [Ja 427]. 
[
GijjhajÄtaka
. I include the story here.]

This story the Teacher told at Jetavana concerning a disobedient monk. He was, they say, of gentle birth, and though ordained in the dispensation that leads to safety, was admonished by his well-wishers, masters, teachers, and fellow-students to this effect, âThus must you advance and thus retreat; thus look at or away from objects; thus must the arm be stretched out or drawn back; thus are the inner and outer garment to be worn; thus is the bowl to be held, and when you have received sufficient food to sustain life, after self-examination, thus are you to partake of it, keeping guard over the door of the senses; in eating you are to be moderate and exercise watchfulness; you are to recognize such and such duties towards monks who come to or go from the monastery; these are the fourteen sets of monastic duties, and the eighty great duties to be duly performed; these are the thirteen ascetic practices; all these are to be scrupulously performed.â Yet was he disobedient and impatient, and did not receive instruction respectfully, but refused to listen to them, saying: âI do not find fault with you. Why do you speak thus to me? I shall know what is for my good, and what is not.â


Then the monks, hearing of his disobedience, sat in the Dhamma Hall, telling of his faults. The Teacher came and asked them what it was they were discussing, and sent for the monk.

Here again the Teacher asked this monk, âIs it true, as they say, that you are disobedient?â âYes, sir.â âLong ago,â said he, âwhen by disobedience you refused to do the bidding of wise men, a razor-wheel was given to you.â And he told a story of the past.

1. âFour gates this iron city has, where I am trapped and caught:

A rampart girds me round about: what evil have I wrought?


2. Now fast are closed the city gates: this wheel destroyeth me:

Why like a caged bird am I caught? Why, Yakkha, should it be?â

3. âA hundred thousand you, good sir, did own, and twenty eke:

Yet to a friend you would not lend thine ear, when he would speak.


4. Swift did you flee across the sea, a perilous thing, I ween;

The four, the eight, did visit straight, and with the eight, sixteen,


5. And with sixteen the thirty-two; and lust did ever feel:

See now, the meed of utter greed upon your head, this wheel. 
[4.4]


6. Who tread the highway of desire that spacious thoroughfare,

That highway great, insatiate â âtis theirs this wheel to bear.


7. Who will not sacrifice their wealth, nor to the path repair,

Who do not know this should be so â âtis theirs this wheel to bear. 
{4.5}


8. Ponder the issue of your deeds, and see

How great your wealth, and do not crave to be

Lord of ill-got gains; do what friends advise

And the wheel shall never come nigh to thee.â 
{4.6}

9. âHow long, O Yakkha, shall this wheel upon my head remain?

How many thousand years? Reveal, nor let me ask in vain!â

10. âThe wheel shall roll, and on shall roll, no saviour shall appear,

Fixed on your head till you be dead â O Mittavinda, hear!â

The Teacher, having ended this discourse, identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the unruly monk was Mittavindaka, and I myself was the King of the Devas.â

## Full Story
âBehold that man.â
 This story the Teacher told at Kapilavatthu, in the Banyan Park, about smiling. 
{4.7}
 At that time they say that the Teacher, wandering afoot with his band of monks in the Banyan Park at evening time, at a certain spot gave a smile. The elder Änanda said: âWhat can be the cause, what the reason, that the Fortunate One should smile? Not without cause do the TathÄgatas smile. I will ask him, then.â So with a gesture of obeisance he asked of this smile. Then the Teacher said to him, âIn days of yore, Änanda, there was a certain sage, named Kaá¹ha, who on this spot of earth lived, meditative, delighting in meditation; and by power of his virtue Sakkaâs abode was shaken.â But as this speech about the smile was not quite clear, at the elderâs request he told this story of the past.
 [4.5]

1. âBehold that man, all black of hue, that dwells on this black spot,

Black is the meat that he does eat â my spirit likes him not!â

2. âThough black of hue, a brahmin true at heart, O Sakka, see:

Not by skin, but if he do wrong, then black a man must be.â 
[4.7]

3. âFair spoken, brahmin, nobly put, most excellently said:

Choose what you will â as bids your heart, so let your choice be made.â

4. âSakka, the lord of all the world, a choice of blessings gave.

From malice, hatred, covetise, deliverance I would have,

And to be free from every lust: these blessings four I crave.â 
{4.11}

5. âIn lust, in hatred, covetise, in malice, brahmin, say

What evil thing do you behold? This answer me, I pray.â

6. âBecause hatred, of ill-will bred, aye grows from small to great,

Is ever full of bitterness, therefore I want no hate.


7. âTis ever thus with wicked men: first word, then touch we see,

Next fist, then staff, and last of all the swordstroke flashing free:

Where malice is, there follows hate â no malice then for me.


8. When men make speed egged on by greed, fraud and deceit arise,

And swift pursuit of savage loot â therefore, no covetise.


9. Firm are the fetters bound by lust, that thrives abundantly

Within the heart, for bitter smart â no lusting then for me.â
 {4.13}

10. âFair spoken, brahmin, nobly put, most excellently said:

Choose what you will â as bids your heart, so let your choice be made.â

11. âO Sakka, lord of all the world, a boon you did me cry.

Where in the woods I ever dwell, where all alone dwell I,

Grant no disease may mar my peace, or break my ecstacy.â

12. âFair spoken, brahmin, nobly put, most excellently said:

Choose what you will â as bids your heart, so let your choice be made.â

13. âO Sakka, lord of all the world, a choice you bid declare:

No creature be aught harmed for me, O Sakka, anywhere,

Neither in body nor in mind: this, Sakka, is my prayer.â 
These lines occur in 
Milinda,
 p. 384.

This lesson ended, the Teacher said: âThis, Änanda, is the place where I dwelt previously,â and thus identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time Anuruddha was Sakka, and for myself, I was Kaá¹ha the Wise.â

One day the monks raised a discussion in the Dhamma Hall, saying: âSirs, the Teacher has great and wide wisdom, he is ready and quick-witted, he is sharp and keen-witted and able to crush the arguments of his opponents, by the power of his wisdom he overthrows the subtle questions propounded by noble sages and reduces them to silence, and having established them in the three refuges and the moral precepts, causes them to enter on the path which leads to immortality.â The Teacher came and asked what was the topic which the monks were debating as they sat together; and on hearing what it was he said: âIt is not wonderful, monks, that the TathÄgata, having attained the Perfection of Wisdom, should overthrow the arguments of his opponents and convert nobles and others. For in the earlier ages, when he was still seeking for supreme knowledge, he was wise and able to crush the arguments of his opponents. Yea verily in the time of VidhurakumÄra, on the summit of the Black Mountain which is sixty leagues in height, by the force of my wisdom I converted the Yakkha general, Puá¹á¹aka, and reduced him to silence and made him give his own life as a gift,â and so saying he told a story of the past.

At SÄvatthi, it is said, a certain lay brother having heard the TathÄgataâs discourse, being pleased at heart, gave an invitation for the morrow; at his door he set up a pavilion, richly decorated, and sent to say that it was time. The Teacher came attended by five hundred monks, and sat in the gorgeous seat appointed for him. The layman, having made rich presents to the company of monks headed by the Buddha, bade them again for the morrow; and so for seven days he invited them, and offered gifts, and on the seventh gave them all a monkâs requisites. In this presentation he offered a special gift of shoes. The pair of shoes offered to the Buddha were worth a thousand pieces of money, those offered to the two chief disciples 
SÄriputta and MoggallÄna.
 were worth five hundred, and shoes to the value of a hundred were given to each of the five hundred monks who remained. And after this presentation made of all that the monks need, he sat down before the Fortunate One, along with his company. Then the Teacher returned thanks in a voice of much sweetness, âLayman, most generous is your gift; be joyful. In olden days, before the Buddha came into the world, there were those who by giving one pair of shoes to a Paccekabuddha, in consequence of that gift found a refuge on the sea where refuge there is none; and you have given to the whole of Buddhaâs company all that a monk can need â how can it be, but that your gift of shoes should prove a refuge to you?â and at his request, he told a story of the past.

1. âO learned brahmin, full of sanctity,

Pupil of many a holy teacher, why 
{4.18}

All out of reason do vain babbling use,

When none is here, save me, to make reply?â

2. â âTis a fair radiant presence, gold-besprent,

That offers me food for my nourishment,

All bravely set upon a plate of gold:

To her I answer âNo,â with heart content.â

3. âIf such a wondrous being one should see,

A man should ask a blessing hopefully.

Arise, beseech her, holding up clasped hands:

Say, are you human, or a deity?â 
{4.19}

4. âAs you beholdest me in kindly way

And âTake and eat this foodâ to me do say,

I ask you, lady, excellent in might,

Are you a DevÄ«, or a woman, pray?â 
[4.12]

5. âA DevÄ« excellent in might am I;

And to mid-ocean hitherward did hie,

Full of compassion and in heart well-pleased,

For your sake come in this extremity.


6. Here food, and drink, and place of rest behold,

Vehicles various and manifold;

You, Saá¹kha, I make lord of every thing

Which for desirable your heart may hold.â

7. âOf all my sacrifice and offering

You are the queen, and thine the governing;

You of fair slender waist, you beauteous-browed: 
In line 29 read 
subbhu suvilÄkamajjhe:
 cp. Commentary.

What deed of mine hath brought to fruit this thing?â 
{4.20}

8. âA solitary, on the burning way,

Weary and footsore, thirsty, you did stay,

O brahmin Saá¹kha, for a gift of shoes:

That gift your Cow of Plenty is this day.â

9. âA ship of planks well built let there be,

Sped by fair winds, impervious to the sea;

No place is here for other vehicle;

This very day take me to MolinÄ«.â 
Benares.
 
{4.21}

10. âShe pleased, delighted, with a happy cheer,

A vessel marvellous caused to appear;

Then, taking Saá¹kha with his serving man,

To that most lovely city brought them near.â

When the Teacher had made an end of this discourse he declared the Truths: now at the conclusion of the Truths the layman entered upon the First Path: and he thus identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time Uppalavaá¹nÄ was the DevadhÄ«tÄ [Maá¹imekhalÄ], Änanda was the attendant, and I myself was the brahmin Saá¹kha.â

 This story the Teacher told in Jetavana, about a passionate man.

The Teacher, hearing of his passionate behaviour, sent for him and asked, was it true that he was passionate, as rumour had it. âYes, sir,â replied the man. âMonk,â the Teacher said, âpassion must be restrained; such an ill-doer has no place either in this world or the next.

From wrangling arises anger, and with it himself will burn.


12. Whose anger grows like fire with fuel and grass that blaze,

As the moon in the dark fortnight, so his honour wanes and decays.


13. He who quiets his anger, like a fire that fuel has none,

As the moon in the light fortnight, his honour waxes well grown.â

## Full Story
âSeven days.â
 
[4.17]
 This story the Teacher told in Jetavana, about a certain discontented monk. The occasion will be explained under the KusajÄtaka [Ja 531].

The story tells that he was of noble birth and lived at SÄvatthi, and on his heartily embracing the dispensation he adopted the ascetic life. Now one day as he was going his rounds for alms in SÄvatthi, he met a fair lady and fell in love with her at first sight. Overcome by his passion he lived an unhappy life, and letting his nails and hair grow long and wearing soiled robes, he pined away and became quite sallow, with all his veins standing out on his body. And just as in the Deva world, the Devaputtas who are destined to fall from their heavenly existence manifest five well-known signs, that is to say, their garlands wither, their robes soil, their bodies grow ill-favoured, perspiration pours from their armpits, and they no longer find pleasure in their Deva home, so too in the case of worldly monks, who fall from the Dhamma, the same five signs are to be seen: the flowers of faith wither, the robes of righteousness soil, through discontent and the effects of an evil name their persons grow ill-favoured, the sweat of corruption streams from them and they no longer delight in a life of solitude at the foot of forest trees â all these signs were to be found in him. So they brought him into the presence of the Teacher, saying: âVenerable sir, this fellow is discontented.â

When the Teacher had enquired whether this report was true, and the man answered that it was true, 
{4.28}
 he said: âMonk, wise men in days long gone by, before the Buddha had arisen, even men who had entered upon an outside sect, for more than fifty years, walking in holiness without caring for it, from the scruples of a sensitive nature never told any one that they had fallen back; and why have you, who have embraced such a dispensation as ours, that leads to safety, and who stand in presence of a venerable Buddha such as I am, why have you declared your discontent before the four kinds of disciples? Why do you not preserve your scruples?â Thus saying, he told a story of the past.

1. âSeven days serene in heart

Pure I lived, desiring merit:

Since then, for fifty years apart,

Self-absorbed, I do declare it,

Here, unwillingly, I live:

May this truth a blessing give:

Poison baulked, the lad revive!â

2. âIf for gifts I cared no jot,

All chance comers entertaining, 
{4.32}

Yet still the good and wise knew not

I was my true self restraining;

If unwillingly I give,

May this truth a blessing give,

Poison baulked, the lad revive!â

3. âThe serpent that bit you today

In yonder hole, my son,

And this your father, are, I say,

In my indifference, one:

May this Truth a blessing give:

Poison baulked, the lad revive!â 
{4.33}

4. âThey leave the world who are serene, subdued,

Save Kaá¹ha, all in no unwilling mood;

What makes you shrink, DÄ«pÄyana, and why

Unwilling walk the path of sanctity?â

5. âHe leaves the world, and then again turns back;

An idiot, a fool! So might one think:

âTis this that makes me shrink,

Thus walk I holy, though the wish I lack,

The cause why I do well, is this â

Praised of the wise the good manâs dwelling is.â 
Or, Praised of the wise and good religion is.

6. âThis your house was like a mere, 
The word may possibly mean 
public-house:
 either is a âdrinking placeâ 
(avapÄna)
.

Food and drink in store supplying:

Sages, travellers, brahmins here

Thirst and hunger satisfying.

Did you fear some scandal, still

Giving, yet against your will?â

7. âSire and grandfather holy were,

Lords of gifts most free in giving;

And I followed with all care

Our ancestral way of living;

Lest degenerate I should be

I gave gifts unwillingly.â

8. âWhen, a young girl, with undeveloped sense,

I brought you from your home to be my wife,

You did not tell me your indifference,

How without love you lived all your life.

Then why, O fair-limbed lady, did you stay

And live with me in this unloving way?â

9. â âTis not the custom in this family

For wedded wife to take a newer mate,

Nor ever has been; and this custom I

Would keep, lest I be called degenerate.

âTwas fear of such report that bade me stay

And live with you in this unloving way.â 
{4.36}

10. âNow I have spoken what should be unsaid:

For our sonâs sake may it be pardoned.

Stronger than parentsâ love is nothing here;

Our YaÃ±Ã±adatta lives, who was but dead!â 
[4.22]

This discourse ended, the Teacher declared the Truths; now at the conclusion of the Truths the discontented monk was established in the fruit of the First Path; and identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time Änanda was Maá¹á¸avya, 
{4.37}
 VisÄkhÄ the wife, RÄhula the son, SÄriputta was Maá¹á¸avya the Peg, and I was myself Black DÄ«pÄyana.â

## Full Story
âWho is the man.â
 This story the Teacher told in the Bamboo Grove, about Devadatta. One day the monks said to him, âFriend Devadatta, the Teacher is most helpful to you! From the Teacher you received your ordination, lesser and greater; you have learned the Three Baskets, the word of the Buddha; you have caused Absorption to arise within you; the glory and gain of the One with Ten Powers belong to you.â At this he held up a blade of grass, with the words, âI can see no good that the ascetic Gotama has done me, not even this much!â


They talked it over in the Dhamma Hall. When the Teacher came in, he asked what they talked about as they sat together. They told him. Said he, âMonks, this is not the first time, but long ago as now Devadatta was ungrateful and treacherous to friends.â And he told them a tale of olden days.
 [4.23]

1. â âWho is the man? I know him not! And the manâs father, who?

Who is the man?â so SÄkha said: âNigrodha, what think you?â


2. Then SÄkhaâs men at SÄkhaâs word dealt buffets on my face,

And seizing me about the throat cast me forth from the place.


3. That such a deed in treachery an evil man should do!

An ingrate is a shame, O king â and he your comrade, too!â
 {4.42}

4. âI know not, nor have ever heard in speech from any one,

Any such ill as this you tell which SÄkha now has done.


5. With me and SÄkha you have lived; we both your comrades were;

Of dominion among mankind you gave us each a share:

By you we got Supernormal Powers, and not a doubt is there.


6. As when a seed in fire is cast, it burns, and cannot grow;

Do a good turn to evil men, it perishes even so.


7. The grateful, good, and virtuous, such men are not as they;

In good soil seeds, in good men deeds, are never thrown away.â 
[4.27]

8. âSeize on this worthless traitor here, whose thoughts so evil be;

Spear him! For I would have him die â his life is nought to me!â

9. âGreat king, have mercy! Life once gone is hard to bring again:

My lord forgive, and let him live! I wish the churl no pain.â

10. âWith Nigrodha one should dwell;

To wait on SÄkha is not well.

Better with Nigrodha death

Than with SÄkha to draw breath.â

This discourse ended, the Teacher said: âSo, monks, you see that Devadatta was ungrateful before,â and then identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time, Devadatta was SÄkha, Änanda was Pottika, and I myself was Nigrodha.â

## Full Story
âNo bulbs are here.â
 This story the Teacher told at Jetavana about a layman who supported his father.


This man we learn was reborn in a needy family. After his motherâs death, he used to rise up early in the morning, and prepare the tooth-twigs and water for cleansing the mouth; then by working for hire or ploughing in the fields, he used to procure rice gruel, and thus fed his father in a manner suiting his station in life. Said his father to him, âMy son, whatever is to be done indoors and out you do alone. Let me find you a wife, and she shall do the 
[4.28]
 household work for you.â âFather,â says he, âif women come into the house they will bring no peace of mind for me or for you. Pray do not dream of such a thing! While you live, I will support you; 
{4.44}
 and when you pass away, I shall know what to do.â


But the father sent for a girl, much against his sonâs wish; and she looked after her husband and his father; but a low creature she was. Now her husband was pleased with her, for attending upon his father; and whatever he could find to please her, that he brought and gave her; and she presented it to her father-in-law. And there came a time when the woman thought: âWhatever my husband gets, he gives to me, but nothing to his father. It is clear that for his father he cares nothing. I must find some way of setting the old man at variance with my husband, and then I shall get him out of the house.â


So from that time she began to make the water too cold or too hot for him, and the food she salted too much or not at all, and the rice she served up all hard or else soaking wet; and by this kind of thing did all she could to provoke him. Then, when he grew angry, she scolded, âWho can wait on an old creature like this!â said she, and stirred up strife. And all over the ground she would spit, and then stir up her husband, âLook there!â would she say, âthatâs your fatherâs doing! I am constantly begging him not to do this and that, and he only gets angry. Either your father must leave this house, or I!â Then the husband answered, âLady, you are young, and you can live where you will; but my father is an old man. If you donât like him, you can leave the house.â This frightened her. She fell at the old manâs feet, and craved pardon, promising to do so no more; and began to care for him as before.


The worthy layman was so worried at first by her goings-on that he omitted visiting the Teacher to hear his discourse; but when she had come to herself again, he went. The Teacher asked why he had not been to hear his preaching this seven or eight days. The man related what had happened. âThis time,â said the Teacher, âyou refused to listen to her, and to turn out your father; but in former times you did as she bade; you took him to a cemetery, and dug him a pit. At the time when you were about to kill him I was a seven-year-old, and I by recounting the goodness of parents, held you back from parricide. At that time you listened to me; and by tending your father while he lived became destined for paradise. I admonished you then, and warned you not to forsake him when you should come into another life; for this cause you have now refused to do as the woman bade you, and your father has not been killed.â Thus saying, at the manâs request, he told a story of the past.

1. âNo bulbs are here, no herbs for cooking meet,

No catmint, nor no other plant to eat.

Then father, why this pit, if need be none,

Delve in Deathâs acre mid the woods alone?â

2. âYour grandfather, son, is very weak and old,

Oppressed by pain from ailments manifold:

Him will I bury in a pit today;

In such a life I could not wish him stay.â

3a. âYou have done sinfully in wishing this,

And for the deed, a cruel deed it is.â

3b. âI too, when you are aged, father mine,

Will treat my father as you treatest thine;

Following the custom of the family

Deep in a pit I too will bury thee.â 
[4.30]

4. âWhat a harsh saying for a boy to say,

And to upbraid a father in this way!

To think that my own son should rail at me,

And to his truest friend unkind should be!â

5. âI am not harsh, my father, nor unkind,

Nay, I regard you with a friendly mind:

But this you do, this act of wrong, your son

Will have no strength to undo again, once done.


6. Whoso, Vasiá¹­á¹­ha, hurts with ill intent

His mother or his father, innocent,

He, when the body is dissolved, shall be

In hell for his next life undoubtedly.


7. Whoso with meat and drink, Vasiá¹­á¹­ha, shall

His mother or his father feed withal, 
{4.48}

He, when the body is dissolved, shall be

In heaven for his next life undoubtedly.â

8. âYou are no heartless ingrate, son, I see,

But kindly-hearted, O my son, to me;

âTwas in obedience to your motherâs word

I thought to do this horrid deed abhorred.â

9. âThat wife of yours, that ill-conditioned dame,

My mother, she that brought me forth â the same â

Let us from far out our dwelling expel,

Lest she work other woe on you as well.â

10. âThat wife of yours, that ill-conditioned dame,

My mother, she that brought me forth â the same â

Like a tamed elephant, in full control,

Let her return again, that sinful soul.â

The Teacher, having ended this discourse, declared the Truths; at the conclusion of the Truths, the dutiful son was established in the fruit of the First Path; then he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time, father and son and daughter-in-law were the same as they are now, and the wise boy was I myself.â

âWhat custom is it.â
 
[4.32]
 This story the Teacher told, after his first visit (as Buddha) to Kapilapura, while he lodged in his fatherâs Banyan Grove, about the king his fatherâs refusal to believe.


At the time, they say that the great king Suddhodana, having given a meal of rice gruel at his own dwelling to the Buddha at the head of twenty thousand monks, during the meal talked pleasantly to him, saying: âSir, at the time of your striving, 
The six years of austerities practised by the Buddha, before he found the peace of Buddhahood.
 some deities came to me, and poised in the air, said: âYour son, prince Siddhattha, has died of starvation.â And the Teacher replied, âDid you believe it, great king?â âSir, I did not believe it! Even when the deities came hovering in the air, and told me this, I refused to believe it, saying that there was no death for my son until he had obtained Buddhahood at the foot of the Bodhi tree.â Said the Teacher, âGreat king, long ago in the time of the great DhammapÄla, even when a world-famed teacher said: âYour son is dead, these are his bones,â you refused to believe, answering, âIn our family, they never die young;â then why should you believe now?â and at his fatherâs request, the Teacher told a tale of long ago.

1. âWhat custom is it, or what holy way,

Of what good deed is this the fruit, I pray?

Tell me, O brahmin, what the reason is,

Why in your line they never die young â say!â 
{4.53}

2. âWe walk in uprightness, we speak no lies,

All foul defilements we do keep afar,

We do eschew all things that evil are,

Therefore in youth not one among us dies.


3. We hear the deeds of foolish and of wise;

Of what the foolish do no heed we take,

The wise we follow, and the fools forsake;

Therefore in youth not one among us dies.


4. In gifts beforehand our contentment lies;


Even while giving we are well content;

Nor having given, do we then repent:

Therefore in youth not one among us dies.


5. Priests, brahmins, wayfarers we satisfy,

Beggars, and mendicants, and all who need,

We give them drink, and hungry folk we feed:

Therefore the young among us do not die.


6. Wedded, for othersâ wives we do not sigh,

But we are faithful to the marriage vow;

And faithful are our wives to us, I know:

Therefore the young among us do not die.


7. The children that from these true wives are sprung

Are wise abundantly, to learning bred,

Versed in the Vedas, and all perfected;

Therefore none dies of us while he is young.


8. Each to do right for sake of heaven tries:

So lives the father, and so lives the mother,

So son and daughter, sister so and brother:

Therefore no one of us when youthful dies.


9. For sake of heaven our servants too apply

Their lives to goodness, men and maidens all, 
{4.54}

Retainers, servitors, each meanest thrall:

Therefore the young among us do not die.â

Righteousness practised well brings happiness;

The righteous comes not into punishment.

11. Righteousness saves the righteous, as a shade

Saves in the time of rain: the lad still lives.

Goodness to DhammapÄla safety gives;

Some otherâs bones are these you have conveyed.â

When the Teacher had thus discoursed to the great king Suddhodana, he declared the Truths, and identified the JÄtaka, now at the conclusion of the truths the king became established in the fruit of the Third Path. âAt that time, mother and father were the great kingâs kin, the teacher was SÄriputta, the retinue was the Buddhaâs retinue, and I myself was the younger DhammapÄla.â

âTrust not in those.â
 This story the Teacher told in the Bamboo Grove, on the subject of going about to kill.


In the Dhamma Hall, the monks were discussing the evil nature of Devadatta. âWhy, sir, by hiring archers and others to the task, Devadatta is making an attempt to murder the One with Ten Powers!â 
{4.56}
 The Teacher, entering, enquired, âWhat is this, monks, that you speak of 
[4.36]
 as you sit here together?â They told him. Said he, â âTis not now the first time that he has tried to murder me, but it was the same before,â and he told them a story.

1. âTrust not in those whose words are lies, nor those who only know

Self-interest, nor who have done wrong, nor who too-pious show.


2. Some men have nature like the kine, thirsty and full of greed:

Have words in truth a friend to soothe, but never come to deed.


3. These hold out dry and empty hands; the voice conceals their heart;

From those who know not gratitude (vain creatures!) keep apart.
 {4.57}


4. Put not your trust in woman or in man of fickle mind,

Nor such as having made a pact to break it are inclined.


5. The man who walks in evil ways, to all things threatening death,

Unsteadfast, put no trust in him, like keenest sword in sheath.


6. Some speak smooth words that come not from the heart, and try to please

With many a show of friendship feigned: put not your trust in these.


7. When such an evil-minded man beholds or food or gain,

He works all ill, and go he will, but first will be your bane.â 
[4.37] {4.58}

8. âIn friendly show full many a foe follows, his aid to give;

As the fowl left the falcon, so âtwere best bad men to leave.


9. Who is not quick to recognise the meaning of events,

Under his foesâ control he goes, and afterward repents.


10. Whoso the meaning of events is quick to recognise,

As from the falconâs toils the fowl, so from his foes he flies.


11. From such inevitable and treacherous snare,

Deadly, set deep mid many a forest tree,

As from the falcon far the fowl did flee,

The man of seeing eye afar should fare.â

The Teacher, having ended this discourse, said: âMonks, long ago as now Devadatta tried to compass my destruction,â and then he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time, Devadatta was the falcon, and I was myself the fowl.â

## Full Story
âWhy in the woodland.â
 This story the Teacher told while sojourning in Jetavana, about a landowner whose son had died. At SÄvatthi, we learn that death took a beloved son of a certain landowner who used to wait upon the Buddha. Afflicted with grief for his son, the man washed not and ate not, and neither went about his own business nor waited upon the Buddha, only cried, âO my beloved son, you have left me, and gone before!â


As in the morning time the Teacher was looking abroad upon the world, he perceived that this man was ripe for attaining the Fruit of the First Path. So next day, having led his followers through the city of SÄvatthi in search of alms, after his meal was done, he sent the monks away, and attended by elder Änanda walked to the place where this man lived. They told the landowner that the Teacher had come. Then they of his household prepared a seat, and 
[4.38]
 made the Teacher sit down upon it, and led the landowner into the Teacherâs presence. After greeting him, as he sat on one side, the Teacher addressed in a voice tender with compassion, âDo you mourn, lay brother, for an only son?â He answered, âYes, sir.â Said the Teacher, âLong, long ago, lay brother, wise men who went about afflicted with grief for a sonâs death, listened to the words of the wise, and clearly discerning that nothing could bring back the lost, felt no grief, no not even a little.â So saying, at his request the Teacher told a story of the past.

1. âWhy in the woodland are you standing here,

Decorated, with earrings in each ear,

Fragrant of sandal, holding out your hands?

What sorrow makes you drop the falling tear?â

2. âMade of fine gold, and shining brilliantly

My chariot is, wherein I use to lie:

For this a pair of wheels I cannot find;

Therefore I grieve so sore that I must die!â

3. âGolden, or set with jewels, any kind,

Brazen or silvern, that you have in mind,

Speak but the word, a chariot shall be made,

And I thereto a pair of wheels will find!â

4a. âThe brahmin youth replied, when he had done.â

4b. âMonks up yonder are the moon and sun!

By such a pair of wheels as yonder twain

My golden car new radiance hath won!â 
[4.39]

5. âYou are a fool for this that you have done,

To pray for that which should be craved by none;

I think, young sir, you needs must perish soon,

For you will never get or moon or sun!â

6. âBefore our eyes they set and rise, colour and course unfailing:

None sees a ghost; then which is now more foolish in his wailing?â

7. âOf us two mourners, O most sapient youth,

I am the greater fool â you sayest truth,

In craving for a spirit from the dead,

Like a child crying for the moon, in truth!â

8. âBlazing was I, as when a man pours oil upon a fire:

You did bring water, and did quench the pain of my desire. 
{4.62}


9. Grief for my son â a cruel shaft was lodged within my heart;

You have consoled me for my grief, and taken out the dart.


10. That dart extracted, free from pain, tranquil and calm I keep;

Hearing, O youth, your words of truth no more I grieve, nor weep.â 
These verses recur in iii. 157 (translation p. 104), 215 (p. 141), 390 (p. 236), Dhp p. 96.

The Teacher, having ended this discourse, declared the Truths and identified the JÄtaka, now at the conclusion of the Truths, the landowner was established in the fruit of the First Path. âAt that time, I was myself the Devaputta who uttered this admonition.â

## Full Story
âWhen food is not.â
 
[4.40]
 This story the Teacher told, while dwelling at Jetavana, about a monk who was devoted to giving.


This man, we are told, having heard the preaching of the Dhamma, from the time when he embraced the dispensation was devoted to giving, eager for giving. Never a bowlful he ate unless he shared it with another; even water he would not drink, unless he gave of it to another, so absorbed was he in giving.


Then they began to talk of his good qualities in the Dhamma Hall. Entered the Teacher, and asked what they talked about as they sat there, and they told him. Sending for the monk, he asked him, âIs it true, what I hear, monk, that you are devoted to giving, eager to give?â He replied, âYes, sir.â Said the Teacher, âLong ago, monks, this man was without faith and unbelieving; not so much as a drop of oil on the end of a blade of grass did he give to any one; then I humbled him, and converted him and made him humble, and taught him the fruit of giving; and this giving heart of his does not leave him even in another life.â So saying, he told a story of the past. 
Part of this tale occurs in No. 313, vol. iii.

1. âWhen food is not within the pot, the good would get, and not deny:

And you are cooking! âTwere not good, if you would now no food supply.


2. He who remiss and niggard is, ever to give denies;

But he who virtue loves, must give, and he whose mind is wise.â

3. âWhen fear of hunger or of thirst makes niggard souls afraid,

In this world and the next those fools shall fully be repaid.


4. Therefore give alms, flee covetise, purge filth of greed away,

In the next world menâs virtuous deeds shall be their surest stay.â 
{4.65}

5. â âTis hard to do as good men do, to give as they can give,

Bad men can hardly imitate the life that good men live.


6. And so, when good and evil go to pass away from earth,

The bad are born in hell below, in heaven the good have birth.â

7. âSome give from little, some give not though they have plenteous store:

Who gives from little, if he gave a thousand, âtwere no more.â 
{4.66}

8. âEven he who lives on scraps should righteous be,

Giving from little store, though sons have he;

The hundred thousand which the wealthy give,

Are worth not one small gift from such as he.â

9. âWhy is a rich and generous sacrifice

Not equal to a righteous gift in price,

How is a thousand, which the wealthy gives,

Not worth a poor manâs gift, thoogh small in size?â 
{4.67}

10. âSome who in evil ways do live

Oppress, and slay, then comfort give:

Their cruel sour-faced gifts are less

Than any given with righteousness.

Thus not a thousand from the wealthy can

Equal the little gift of such a man.â

The Teacher, having finished this discourse, said: âThus, monks, this monk in former times was unbelieving, and never gave even a little to any one, but I humbled him, and taught him the fruit of generosity; and that mind leaves him not, even when he enters another life.â Then he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time, the generous monk was the rich man, SÄriputta was Canda, MoggallÄna was Suriya, Kassapa was MÄtali, Änanda was PaÃ±casikha, and I myself was Sakka.â

## Full Story
âFine-coloured are you.â
 
{4.70}
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling in Jetavana, about a greedy monk. This man, it is said, dissatisfied with his mendicantâs garb and so forth, used to march about asking, âWhere is there a meal for the Saá¹gha? Where is there an invitation?â and when he heard mention 
[4.45]
 of meat, he showed great delight. Then some well-meaning monks, from kindness towards him, told the Teacher about it. The Teacher summoning him, asked, âIs it true, monk, as I hear, that you are greedy?â âYes, my lord, it is true,â said he. âMonk,â said the Teacher, âwhy are you greedy, after embracing a dispensation like ours, that leads to safety? The state of greed is sinful; long ago, by reason of greed, you were not satisfied with the dead bodies of elephants and other offal in Benares, and went away into the mighty forest.â So saying, he told a story of the past.

1. âFine-coloured are you, fair of form, all plump in body, red of hue,

O Goose! I swear you are most fair, your face and senses clear and true!


2. Sitting on the Gangesâ bank you feedest on the pike and bream,

Roach, carp, and all the other fish that swim along the Gangesâ stream!â 
The fish named are: 
pÄvusa, vÄlaja, muÃ±ja, rohita
 (Cyprinus Rohita), and 
pÄá¹­hÄ«na
 (Silvans Boalis).

3. âNo bodies from the tide I eat, nor lying in the wood:

All kinds of weed â on them I feed; that, friend, is all my food.â

4. âI cannot credit what the goose avers about his meat.

Things in the village soused with salt and oil are what I eat,


5. A mess of rice, all clean and nice, which a man makes and pours

Upon his meat; but yet, my colour, goose, is not like yours.â

6. âBeholding wrong your heart within, destroying humankind,

In fear and fright your food you eat; therefore this hue you find.


7. Crow, you erred in the world by defilements of former lives,

You have no pleasure in your food; âtis this your colour gives.


8. But, friend, I eat and do no hurt, not anxious, at my ease,

Having no trouble, fearing nought from any enemies. 
[4.46]


9. Thus you should do, and mighty grow, renounce your evil ways,

Walk in the world and do no hurt; then all will love and praise.


10. Who to all creatures kindly is, nor wounds nor makes to wound,

Who harries not, none harry him, âgainst him no hate is found.â 
{4.72}

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he declared the Truths; now at the conclusion of the Truths, the greedy monk was established in the fruit of the Third Path), âAt that time, the greedy monk was the crow, RÄhulaâs mother was the mate of the ruddy goose, and I was the ruddy goose myself.â

## Full Story
âDeclare the truth.â
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling in Jetavana, about the MahÄmaá¹gala Discourse, or the Treatise on Omens. 
See Snp 2.4. 
 At the city of RÄjagaha for some cause or another a great company had gathered in the royal resting-house, and among these was a man who got up, and went out, with the words, âThis is a day of good omen.â Someone else heard it, and said: âThat fellow has gone out talking of âomens;â what does he mean by omen?â Said a third, âThe sight of anything with a lucky look is a good omen; suppose a man 
[4.47]
 rises early and see a perfectly white bull, or a woman with child, or a red fish, 
Cyprinus Rohita.
 or a jar filled to the brim, or new-melted ghee of cowâs-milk, or a new unwashed garment, or rice porridge, there is no omen better than these.â Some of the bystanders commended this explanation, âWell put,â said they.


But another 
{4.73}
 broke in, âNo, thereâs no omen in those; what you hear is the omen. A man hears people saying âFull,â then he hears âFull-grownâ or âGrowing,â or he hears them say âEatâ or âChewâ: thereâs no omen better than these.â Some bystanders said: âWell put,â and commended this explanation.


Another said: âThereâs no omen in all that; what you touch 
Mutaá¹
 must be here a corrupt form of Skt. 
má¹á¹£á¹­aá¹
 âtouched.â
 is the omen. If a man gets up early, and touches the earth, or touches green grass, fresh cow-dung, a clean robe, a red fish, gold or silver, food, thereâs no better omen than these.â And here too some of the bystanders approved, and said it was well put. And then the partisans of omens of sight, omens of sound, omens of touch formed into three groups, but were unable to convince one another.


From the deities of the earth to Brahmaâs Realm none could say exactly what an omen was. Sakka thought: âAmong gods and men no one but the Fortunate One is able to solve this question of the omens. To the Fortunate One I will go, and put the question to him.â So at night he paid a visit to the Fortunate One, and greeted him, and placing his hands together in supplication, he put the question beginning, âMany gods and men there be.â Then the Teacher in twelve verses told him the eight-and-thirty great omens. And as he repeated the omen-verses one after another, gods to the number of ten thousand millions became Arahats, and of those who entered the other three Paths there is no counting. When Sakka had heard the omens he returned to his own place. When the Teacher had told the omens, the world of men and the world of gods approved, and said: âWell put.â


Then in the Dhamma Hall they began to discuss the virtues of the TathÄgata, âSirs, the Omen Problem was beyond the scope of others, but the Buddha comprehended the hearts of men and of gods, and solved their doubt, as if he were making the moon rise in the sky! Ah, very wise is the TathÄgata, my friends!â The Teacher entered and asked what they were talking about, as they sat there, and they told him. Said he, âIt is no marvel, monks, that I solved the problem of the omens now that I am possessed of perfect wisdom; but even when I walked on earth as Bodhisatta, I solved the doubts of men and of gods, by answering the Omen Problem.â So saying, he told a story of the past.

And tell what scripture, or what holy text,

3. âWho shows to all the world a modest cheer,

To men and women, sons and daughters dear,

Who to reviling answers not in kind,

Surely a blessing he to every peer. 
[4.49]


4. Who clear of intellect, in crisis wise,

Nor playmates nor companions does despise,

Nor boasts of birth or wisdom, caste, or wealth,

Among his mates a blessing does arise.


5. Who takes good men and true his friends to be,

That trust him, for his tongue from venom free,

Who never harms a friend, who shares his wealth,

Surely a blessing among friends is he.


6. Whose wife is friendly, and of equal years,

Devoted, good, and many children bears,

Faithful and virtuous and of gentle birth,

That is the blessing that in wives appears.


7. Whose king the mighty Lord of Beings is,

That knows pure living and all potencies,

And says, âHe is my friend,â and means no guile

That is the blessing that in monarchs lies.


8. The true believer, giving drink and food,

Flowers and garlands, perfumes, ever good,

With heart at peace, and spreading joy around:

This in all heavens brings beatitude.


9. Whom by good living virtuous sages try

With effort strenuous to purify, 
{4.77}

Good men and wise, by tranquil life built up,

A blessing he mid saintly company.â 
{4.78}

10. âThese blessings then, that in the world befall,

Esteemed by all the wise, magnifical,

What man is prudent let him follow these,

For in the omens is no truth at all.â

The Teacher having ended this discourse, said: âNot now alone, monks, but in olden days I explained the Problem of the Omens,â and then he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time, the company of Buddhaâs followers were the band of sages; 
{4.79}
 SÄriputta was the senior of the pupils, who asked the question about omens; and I myself was the Teacher.â

âBlack Kaá¹ha, rise.â
 
[4.50]
 This story the Teacher told in Jetavana about a sonâs death. The circumstances are like those in the Maá¹­á¹­hakuá¹á¸alijÄtaka [Ja 449].

This story the Teacher told while sojourning in Jetavana, about a landowner whose son had died. At SÄvatthi, we learn that death took a beloved son of a certain landowner who used to wait upon the Buddha. Afflicted with grief for his son, the man washed not and ate not, and neither went about his own business nor waited upon the Buddha, only cried, âO my beloved son, you have left me, and gone before!â


As in the morning time the Teacher was looking abroad upon the world, he perceived that this man was ripe for attaining the Fruit of the First Path. So next day, having led his followers through the city of SÄvatthi in search of alms, after his meal was done, he sent the monks away, and attended by elder Änanda walked to the place where this man lived. They told the landowner that the Teacher had come. Then they of his household prepared a seat, and made the Teacher sit down upon it, and led the landowner into the Teacherâs presence.

Here again the Teacher asked the lay brother, âAre you in grief, layman?â He replied, âYes, sir.â âLayman,â said the Teacher, âlong ago wise men listened to the bidding of the wise, and did not grieve for the death of a son.â And at his request, he told a story of the past.

1. âBlack Kaá¹ha, rise! Why close the eyes to sleep? Why lying there

Thine own born brother â see, the winds away his wit do bear,

Away his wisdom! 
Lit. âhis heart and his right eyeâ (Sch.): cf. Sanskr.

{4.85}

2. âSo soon the long-haired Kesava heard Rohiá¹eyyaâs cry,

He rose all anxious and distressed for Ghataâs misery.â

3. âIn maniac fashion, why do you pace DvÄraka all through,

And cry, âHare, hare!â Say, who is there has taken a hare from you?â

4. âBe it of gold, or made of jewels fine,

Or brass, or silver, as you may incline, 
These lines have occurred already in No. 449.

Shell, stone, or coral, I declare

Iâll make a hare.


5. And many other hares there be, that range the woodland wide,

They shall be brought, Iâll have them caught; say, which do you decide?â

6. âI crave no hare of earthly kind, but that within the moon: 
What we call the Man in the Moon is in India called the Hare in the Moon, cf. Ja 316.

O bring him down, O Kesava! I ask no other boon!â

7. âIn truth, my brother, you will die, if you make such a prayer,

And ask for what no man may pray, the moonâs celestial hare.â

8. âIf, Kaá¹ha, this you know, and can console anotherâs woe,

Why are you mourning still the son who died so long ago?â

9. âMy son is born, let him not die! Neither man nor Amanussa

Can have that boon; then wherefore pray for what can never be?


10. Nor mystic charm, nor magic roots, nor herbs, nor money spent,

Can bring to life again that ghost whom, Kaá¹ha, you lament.â

11. âMen had I, wise and excellent to give me good advice:

But how has Ghatapaá¹á¸ita opened this day mine eyes!


12. Blazing was I, as when a man pours oil upon a fire; 
These lines occur above, p. 39.

You did bring water, and did quench the pain of my desire.


13. Grief for my son, a cruel shaft was lodged within my heart;

You have consoled me for my grief, and taken out the dart.


14. That dart extracted, free from pain, tranquil, and calm I keep;

Hearing, O youth, your words of truth, no more I grieve nor weep.â

15. âThus do the merciful, and thus they who are wise indeed:

They free from pain, as Ghata here his eldest brother freed.â

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he said: âLay brother, thus people have got free from grief for a son by attending to the words of wise men of old; do not you think about it.â Then he declared the Truths; at the conclusion of the Truths the lay brother was established in the fruit of the First Path; and identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time, Änanda was Rohiá¹eyya, SÄriputta was VÄsudeva, the followers of the Buddha were the other persons, and I myself was Ghatapaá¹á¸ita.â

## Full Story
âThough far away.â
 
[4.58] {4.90}
 This story the Teacher told, while dwelling in Jetavana, about an elder who had his mother to support. The circumstances of the event are like those of the SÄmajÄtaka [Ja 540].

This story the Teacher told at Jetavana, about a certain monk who supported his mother. They say that there was a wealthy merchant at SÄvatthi, who was worth eighteen crores; and he had a son who was very dear and winning to his father and mother. One day the youth went upon the terrace of the house, and opened a window and looked down on the street; and when he saw the great crowd going to Jetavana with perfumes and garlands in their hands to hear the Dhamma preached, he exclaimed that he would go too.


So having ordered perfumes and garlands to be brought, he went to the monastery, and having distributed robes, medicines, drinks, etc. to the assembly and honoured the Fortunate One with perfumes and garlands, he sat down on one side. After hearing the Dhamma, and perceiving the evil consequences of desire and the blessings arising from adopting the ascetic life, when the assembly broke up he asked the Fortunate One for ordination, but he was told that the TathÄgatas do not ordain anyone who has not obtained the permission of his parents; so he went away, and lived a week without food, and having at last obtained his parentsâ consent, he returned and begged for ordination. The Teacher sent a monk who ordained him; and after he was ordained he obtained great honour and gain; he won the favour of his teachers and preceptors, and having received full orders he mastered the Dhamma in five years.


Then he thought to himself, âI live here distracted â it is not suitable for me,â and he became anxious to reach the goal of insight; so having obtained instruction in meditation from his teacher, he departed to a frontier village and dwelt in the forest, and there having entered a course of insight, however much he laboured and strove for twelve years, he failed to attain any special insight.


His parents also, as time went on, became poor, for those who hired their land or carried on merchandise for them, finding out that there was no son or brother in the family to enforce the payment, seized what they could lay their hands upon and ran away as they pleased, and the servants and labourers in the house seized the gold and coin and made off therewith, so that at the end the two were reduced to an evil plight and had not even a jug for pouring water; and at last they sold their dwelling, and finding themselves homeless, and in extreme misery, they wandered begging for alms, clothed in rags and carrying potsherds in their hands.


Now at that time a monk came from Jetavana to the sonâs place of abode; he performed the duties of hospitality and, as he sat quietly, he first asked whence he was come; and learning that he was come from Jetavana he asked after the health of the Teacher and the principal disciples and then asked for news of his parents, âTell me, sir, about the welfare of such and such a merchantâs family in SÄvatthi.â âO friend, donât ask for news of that family.â âWhy not, sir?â âThey say that there was one son in that family, but he has become an ascetic in this dispensation, and since he left the world that family has gone to ruin; and at the present time the two old people are reduced to a most lamentable state and beg for alms.â


When he heard the otherâs words he could not remain unmoved, but began to weep with his eyes full of tears, and when the other asked him why he wept, âO sir,â he replied, âthey are my own father and mother, I am their son.â âO friend, your father and mother have come to ruin through you â do you go and take care of them.â âFor twelve years,â he thought to himself, âI have laboured and striven but never been able to attain the Path or the Fruit: I must be incompetent; what have I to do with the ascetic life? I will become a householder and will support my parents and give away my wealth, and will thus eventually become destined for heaven.â


So having determined he gave up his abode in the forest to the elder, and the next day departed and by successive stages reached the monastery at the back of Jetavana which is not far from SÄvatthi. There he found two roads, one leading to Jetavana, the other to SÄvatthi. As he stood there, he thought: âShall I see my parents first or the One with Ten Powers?â Then he said to himself, âIn old days I saw my parents for a long time, from henceforth I shall rarely have the chance of seeing the Buddha; I will see the Fully Awakened One today and hear the Dhamma, and then tomorrow morning I will see my parents.â So he left the road to SÄvatthi and in the evening arrived at Jetavana.


Now that very day at daybreak, the Teacher, as he looked upon the world, had seen the potentialities of this young man, and when he came to visit him he praised the virtues of parents in the MÄtiposakasutta [SN 7.19]. As he stood at the end of the assembly of elders and listened, he thought: âIf I become a householder I can support my parents; but the Teacher also says, âA son who has become an ascetic can be helpful,â I went away before without seeing the Teacher, and I failed in such an imperfect ordination; I will now support my parents while still remaining an ascetic without becoming a householder.â So he took his ticket and his ticket-food and gruel, and felt as if he had committed a wrong deserving expulsion after a solitary abode of twelve years in the forest. In the morning he went to SÄvatthi and he thought to himself, âShall I first get the gruel or see my parents?â He reflected that it would not be right to visit them in their poverty empty-handed; so he first got the gruel and then went to the door of their old house.


When he saw them sitting by the opposite wall after having gone their round for the alms given in broth, he stood not far from them in a sudden burst of sorrow with his eyes full of tears. They saw him but knew him not; then his mother, thinking that it was someone standing for alms, said to him, âWe have nothing fit to be given to you, be pleased to pass on.â When he heard her, he repressed the grief which filled his heart and remained still standing as before with his eyes full of tears, and when he was addressed a second and a third time he still continued standing.


At last the father said to the mother, âGo to him; can this be your son?â She rose and went to him and, recognising him, fell at his feet and lamented, and the father also joined his lamentations, and there was a loud outburst of sorrow. To see his parents he could not control himself, but burst into tears; then, after yielding to his feelings, he said: âDo not grieve, I will support you,â so having comforted them and made them drink some gruel, and sit down on one side, he went again and begged for some food and gave it to them, and then went and asked for alms for himself, and having finished his meal, took up his abode at a short distance off.


From that day forward he watched over his parents in this manner; he gave them all the alms he received for himself, even those at the fortnightly distributions, and he went on separate expeditions for his own alms, and ate them; and whatever food he received as provision for the rainy season he gave to them, while he took their worn-out garments and dyed them with the doors fast closed and used them himself; but the days were few when he gained alms and there were many when he failed to win anything, and his inner and outer clothing became very rough.


As he watched over his parents he gradually grew very pale and thin and his friends and intimates said to him, âYour complexion used to be bright, but now you have become very pale â has some illness come upon you?â He replied, âNo illness has come upon me, but a hindrance has befallen me,â and he told them the history. âSir,â they replied, âthe Teacher does not allow us to waste the offerings of the faithful, you do an unlawful act in giving to laymen the offerings of the faithful.â When he heard this he shrank away ashamed.


But not satisfied with this they went and told it to the Teacher, saying: âSo and so, sir, has wasted the offerings of the faithful and used them to feed laymen.â The Teacher sent for the young man of family and said to him, âIs it true that you, an ascetic, take the offerings of the faithful and support laymen with them?â He confessed that it was true. Then the Teacher, wishing to praise what he had done and to declare an old action of his own, said: âWhen you support laymen whom do you support?â âMy parents,â he answered.

On this occasion also the Teacher said, addressing the monks, âBe not angry, monks, with this man; wise men there have been of old, who even when born from the womb of animals, being parted asunder from their mothers, refused for seven days to take food, pining away; and even when they were offered food fit for a king, did but reply, âWithout my mother I will not eat;â yet took food again when they saw the mother.â So saying, he told a story of the past.

1. âThough far away this elephant should go,

Still olibane and kuá¹­aja 
A medicinal plant. 
 will grow,

Grain, grass, and oleander, lilies white,

On sheltered spots the bluebells dark still blow.


2. Somewhere that royal elephant must go,

Full fed by those whose breast and body show

All gold-bedecked, that king or prince may ride

Fearless to triumph oâer the mailclad foe.â

3. âCome, take a morsel, elephant, and never pine away:

Thereâs many a thing to serve your king that you shall do one day.â

4. âNay, she by Mount Caá¹á¸oraá¹a, poor blind and wretched one,

Beats with a foot on some tree-root, without her royal son.â

5. âWho isât by Mount Caá¹á¸oraá¹a, what blind and wretched one,

Beats with a foot on some tree-root, without her royal son?â

6. âMy mother by Caá¹á¸oraá¹a, ah blind, ah wretched one!

Beats with her foot on some tree-root for lack of me, her son!â

7. âThis mighty elephant, who feeds his mother, let go free:

And let him to his mother go, and to all his family.â

8. âThe elephant from prison freed, the beast set free from chain,

With words of consolation 
The Commentator explains that the elephant discoursed on virtue to the king, then told him to be careful, and departed, amid the plaudits of the multitude, who threw flowers upon him. He then went home, and fed and washed his mother. To explain this, the Master repeated the two verses.
 went back to the hills again. 
{4.94}


9. Then from the cool and limpid pool, where Elephants frequent,

He with his trunk drew water, and his mother all besprent.â

10. âWho brings unseasonable rain â what evil deity?

For he is gone, my own, my son, who used to care for me.â

11. âRise mother! Why should you there lie? Your own, your son has come!

Vedeha, KÄsiâs glorious king, has sent me safely home.â

12. âLong live that king! Long may he bring his realms prosperity,

Who freed that son who ever has done so great respect to me!â 
[4.61]

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he declared the Truths, and identified the JÄtaka, now at the conclusion of the Truths the monk who supported his mother was established in the fruit of the First Path. âAt that time, Änanda was the king, the lady MahÄmÄyÄ was the female elephant, and I was myself the elephant that fed his mother.â

Elder Änanda then says he will do it if he is granted eight boons, and he is chosen. The Buddha then tells a story of how a brahmin had asked for several boons from a king in the past, and had been granted his heartâs desire.

## Full Story
âO king of men.â
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana about the boons received by elder Änanda. During the twenty years of his first Buddhahood the Fortunate Oneâs attendants were not always the same: sometimes elder NÄgasamÄla, sometimes NÄgita, UpavÄá¹a, Sunakkhatta, Cunda, SÄgala, sometimes Meghiya waited upon the Fortunate One. One day the Fortunate One said to the monks, âNow I am old, monks: and when I say, âLet us go in this way,â some of the Saá¹gha go by another way, some drop my bowl and robe on the ground. Choose out one monk to attend always upon me.â


Then they all rose up, beginning with elder SÄriputta, and laid their joined hands to their heads, crying, âI will serve you, sir, I will serve you!â But he refused them, saying: âYour prayer is forestalled! Enough.â Then the monks said to the elder Änanda, âDo you, friend, ask for the post of attendant.â The elder said: âIf the Fortunate One will not give me the robe which he himself has received, if he will not give me his dole of food, if he will not grant me to dwell in the same fragrant cell, if he will not have me with him to go where he is invited; but if the Fortunate One will go with me where I am invited, if I shall be granted to introduce the company at the moment of coming, which comes from foreign parts and foreign countries to see the Fortunate One, 
{4.96}
 if I shall be granted to approach the Fortunate One as soon as doubt shall arise, if whenever the Fortunate One shall discourse in my absence he will repeat his discourse to me as soon as I shall return: then I will attend upon the Fortunate One.â These eight boons he craved, four negative and four positive. And the Fortunate One granted them to him. 
[4.62]


After that he attended continually upon his Teacher for five and twenty years. So having obtained the preeminence in the five points, 
Are these the five 
abhabbatthÄnas
?
 and having gained seven blessings â blessing of Dhamma, blessing of instruction, blessing of the knowledge of causes, blessing of inquiry as to oneâs good, blessing of dwelling in a holy place, blessing of enlightened devotion, blessing of potential Buddhahood â in the presence of the Buddha he received the heritage of eight boons, and became famous in the Buddhaâs dispensation, and shone as the moon in the heavens.


One day they began to talk about it in the Dhamma Hall, âFriend, the TathÄgata has satisfied elder Änanda by granting his boons.â The Teacher entered, and asked, âWhat are you speaking of, monks, as you sit here?â They told him. Then he said: âIt is not now the first time, monks, but in former days as now I satisfied Änanda with a boon; in former days, as now, whatsoever he asked, I gave him.â And so saying, he told a story of the past.

1. âO king of men, hear what I have to say!

Not without cause have I come here this day.

âTis said, O best of men, one should not pass

A wandering brahmin standing in the way.â 
[4.63]

2. âI heard, I stand: come brahmin, quickly say,

What cause it is has brought you here today?

What boon is it that you would crave of me

That you are come to see me? Speak, I pray!â

3. âGive me five villages, all choice and fine,

A hundred slave girls, seven hundred kine,

More than a thousand ornaments of gold,

And two wives give me, of like birth with mine.â 
{4.98}


4. âHave you a penance, brahmin, dread to tell,

Or have you many a charm and many a spell,

Or Yakkhas, ready your behests to do,

Or any claim for having served me well?â


5. âNo penance have I, nor no charm and spell,

No Yakkhas ready to obey me well,

Nor any meed for service can I claim;

But we have met before, the truth to tell.â


6. âI cannot call to mind, in time past oâer,

That I have ever seen your face before.

Tell me, I beg you, tell this thing to me,

When have we met, or where, in days of yore?â


7. âIn the fair city of GandhÄraâs king,

Taxila, my lord, was our dwelling.

There in the pitchy darkness of the night

Shoulder to shoulder you and I did fling.


8. And as we both were standing there, O prince,

A friendly talk between us straight begins.

Then we together met, and only then,

Nor ever once before, nor ever since.â


9. âWhenever, brahmin, a wise man has met

A good man in the world, he should not let

Friendship once made or old acquaintance go

For nothing, nor the thing once done forget.


10. âTis fools deny the thing once done, and let

Old friendships fail of those they once have met.

Many a deed of fools to nothing comes,

They are ungrateful, and they can forget.


11. But trusty men cannot forget the past,

Their friendship and acquaintance ever fast. 
{4.99}

A trifle done by such is not disowned:

Thus trusty men are grateful to the last.


12. Five villages I give you, choice and fine,

A hundred slave girls, and seven hundred kine,

More than a thousand ornaments of gold,

And more, two wives of equal birth with thine.â 
[4.64]


13. âO king, thus is it when the good agree:

As the full moon among the stars we see,

Even so, O Lord of KÄsi, so am I,

Now you have kept the bargain made with me.â 
{4.100}

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he said: âThis is not the first time, monks, that I have satisfied Änanda with boons, but I have done it before.â With these words, he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time Änanda was the brahmin, and I was myself the king.â

âI do the right.â
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling in Jetavana, how Devadatta was swallowed up in the earth. They gathered in the Dhamma Hall to talk, âFriend, Devadatta fell at odds with the TathÄgata, and was swallowed up in the earth.â The Teacher entered and asked what they were talking of as they sat there. They told him. He replied, âNow, monks, he has been swallowed up in the earth because he dealt a blow at my victorious authority; but formerly he dealt a blow at the authority of the Dhamma, and was swallowed up in the earth, and went on his way to nethermost hell.â So saying, he told a story of the past.

1. âI do the right, menâs fame is of my grace,

Me sages and me brahmins ever praise,

Worshipped of men and gods, the right of way

Is mine. Right am I; then, O Wrong, give place!â

2. âIn the strong car of Wrong enthroned on high

Me mighty there is nought can terrify:

Then why should I, who never yet gave place,

Make way today for Right to pass me by?â


3. âRight 
cf. Pali text, iii. 29 (translation, p. 19).
 of a truth was first made manifest,

Primeval he, the oldest, and the best;

Wrong was the younger, later born in time.

Way, younger, at the elder-bornâs behest!â


4. âNor if you worthy be, nor if you pray,

Nor if it be but fair, will I give way: 
{4.102}

Here let us two today a battle wage;

He shall have place, whoever wins the fray.â


5. âKnown am I in all regions far and near,

Mighty, of boundless glory, without peer,

All virtues are united in my form.

Right am I: Wrong, how can you conquer here?


6. By iron gold is beaten, nor do we

Gold used for beating iron ever see:

If Wrong âgainst Right shall win the fight today,

Iron as beautiful as gold will be.


7. If you indeed are mighty in the fray,

Though neither good nor wise is what you say,

Swallow I will all these your evil words;

And willy nilly I will make you way.â

8. âThe words no sooner heard, Wrong from the height

Plunged over heels head-foremost out of sight:

This was the end and direful fate of Wrong.

I had no battle, though I longed to fight.


9. Thus by the Mighty-in-Forbearance lies

Conquered the Mighty Warrior Wrong, and dies

Swallowed in earth: the other, joyful, strong,

Truth-armoured, in his car away he hies.


10. Who in his house no due observance pays

To parents, sages, brahmins, when he lays

The body down, and bursts its bonds asunder,

He, even from this world, goes straight to hell,

Even as Adhamma down head-foremost fell.


11. Who in his house all due observance pays

To parents, sages, brahmins, when he lays

The body down, and bursts its bonds asunder,

Straight from this world, onward to heaven he hies,

As Dhamma in his chariot sought the skies.â 
{4.104}

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he said: âNot only now, monks, but in former times also, Devadatta attacked me, and was swallowed up in the earth,â then he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time Devadatta was Adhamma, and his attendants were the attendants of Devadatta, and I was Dhamma, and the Buddhaâs attendants were the attendants of Dhamma.â

## Full Story
âYou flawless.â
 This story the Teacher told, while dwelling in Jetavana, about a discontented monk. The occasion will be explained under the KusajÄtaka [Ja 531].

The story tells that he was of noble birth and lived at SÄvatthi, and on his heartily embracing the dispensation he adopted the ascetic life. Now one day as he was going his rounds for alms in SÄvatthi, he met a fair lady and fell in love with her at first sight. Overcome by his passion he lived an unhappy life, and letting his nails and hair grow long and wearing soiled robes, he pined away and became quite sallow, with all his veins standing out on his body. And just as in the Deva world, the Devaputtas who are destined to fall from their heavenly existence manifest five well-known signs, that is to say, their garlands wither, their robes soil, their bodies grow ill-favoured, perspiration pours from their armpits, and they no longer find pleasure in their Deva home, so too in the case of worldly monks, who fall from the Dhamma, the same five signs are to be seen: the flowers of faith wither, the robes of righteousness soil, through discontent and the effects of an evil name their persons grow ill-favoured, the sweat of corruption streams from them and they no longer delight in a life of solitude at the foot of forest trees â all these signs were to be found in him. So they brought him into the presence of the Teacher, saying: âVenerable sir, this fellow is discontented.â

Again the Teacher asked the man, âIs it true, monk, that you are discontent, as they say?â And he replied, âYes, sir.â Then he said: âO monk, why are you discontent from a dispensation such as ours, that leads to safety, and all for fleshly sensual desires? Wise men of old, who were kings in Surundha, a city prosperous and measuring twelve leagues either way, though for seven hundred years they lived in one chamber with a woman beauteous as the DevaccharÄs, yet did not yield to their senses, and never so much as looked at her with desire.â So saying, he told a story of the past.
 [4.67]

1. âYou flawless in your beauty, pure and bright,

You sitting lonely on this terrace-height,

In pose most graceful, eyed like nymphs of heaven,

I pray you, let me spend with you this night!â

2. âTo this battlemented city, dug with moats, approach is hard,

While its trenches and its towers hand and sword unite to guard.


3. Not the young and not the mighty entrance here can lightly gain;

Tell me â what can be the reason why to meet me you are fain?â

4. âI, fair beauty, am a Yakkha, I that now appear to you:

Grant to me your favour, lady, this full bowl receive from me.â

5. âI ask for none, since Udaya has died,

Nor god nor Yakkha, no nor man, beside:

Therefore, O mighty Yakkha, get you gone,

Come no more hither, but far off abide.â

6. âThat chief joy, to lovers known completely,

Which makes men do full many an evil thing,

Despise not you, O lady, smiling sweetly:

See, a full bowl of silver here I bring!â

7. âMen that would woo a woman, raise and raise

The bids of gold, till she their will obeys.

The godsâ ways differ, as I judge by you:

You comest now with less than other days.â

8. âO woman! Youthful bloom and beauty fade

Within this world of men, you fair-limbed maid.

And you today are older grown than erst,

So dwindles less the sum I would have paid.


9. Thus, glorious daughter of a king, before my gazing eyes

As goes the flight of day and night your beauty fades and dies.


10. But if, O daughter of a king most wise, it pleases you

Holy and pure to aye endure, more lovely shall you be!â 
{4.109}

11. âThe gods are not like men, they grow not old;

Upon their flesh is seen no wrinkled fold.

How isât the gods have no corporeal frame?

This, mighty Yakkha, I would now be told!â

12. âThe gods are not like men: they grow not old;

Upon their flesh is seen no wrinkled fold:

Tomorrow and tomorrow ever more

Celestial beauty grows, and bliss untold.â 
{4.110}

13. âWhat terrifies so many mortals here?

I ask you, mighty Yakkha, to make clear

That path, in such diversity explained:

How faring heavenwards need no one fear?â

14. âWho keeps in due control both voice and mind,

Who with the body loves not wrong to do,

Within whose house much food and drink we find,

Large-handed, bounteous, in all faith all true,

Of favours free, soft-tongued, of kindly cheer â

He that so walks to heaven need nothing fear.â 
{4.111}

15. âLike a mother, like a father, Yakkha, you admonish me:

Mighty one, O beauteous being, tell me, tell me who you be?â 
[4.70]

16. âI am Udaya, fair lady, for my promise come to you:

Now I go, for I have spoken; from the promise I am free.â

17. âIf youâre Udaya, come hither for your promise â truly he â,

Then instruct me, that together we, O prince, again may be!â

18. âYouth passes soon: a moment â âtis gone by;

No standing-place is firm: all creatures die

To new life born: this fragile frame decays:

Then be not careless, walk in piety.


19. If the whole earth with all her wealth could be

The realm of one sole king to hold in fee,

A holy saint would leave him in the race:

Then be not careless, walk in piety. 
{4.112}


20. Mother and father, brother-kin, and she

(The wife) who with a price can purchased be,

They go, and each the other leave behind:

Then be not careless, walk in piety.


21. Remember that this body food shall be

For others; joy alike and misery,

A passing hour, as life succeeds to life:

Then be not careless, walk in piety.â

22. âSweet the saying of this Yakkha: brief the life that mortals know,

Sad it is, and short, and with it comes inseparable woe.

I renounce the world: from KÄsi, from Surundhana, I go.â

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he declared the Truths and identified the JÄtaka, now at the conclusion of the Truths, the discontented monk was established in the fruit of the First Path. âAt that time RÄhulaâs mother was the princess, and Sakka was I myself.â

## Full Story
âThe water-draught.â
 
[4.71]
 This story the Teacher told, while dwelling in Jetavana, about the subduing of evil passions.


At one time, we learn, five hundred citizens of SÄvatthi, being householders and friends of the TathÄgata, had heard the Dhamma and had renounced the world, and been ordained as monastics. Living in the house of the Golden Pavement, at midnight they indulged in thoughts of wrong. (All the details are to be understood as in a previous story.) 
[Ja 408 
KumbhakÄrajÄtaka
. I include the story here.]

The Teacher regards his disciples three times a night and three times a day, six times every night and day, as a jay guards her egg, or a yak-cow her tail, or a mother her beloved son, or a one-eyed man his remaining eye; so in the very instant he overcame wrong which was beginning. He was observing Jetavana on that midnight and knowing the monksâ conduct and their thoughts, he considered, âThis wrong among these monks if it grows will destroy the foundation for becoming an Arahat. I will this moment repudiate this wrong and show them how to become Arahats,â so leaving the perfumed chamber he called Änanda, and bidding him collect all the monks dwelling in the place, he got them together and sat down on the seat prepared for Buddha.

At the command of the Fortunate One, the Saá¹gha was assembled by the venerable Änanda. The Teacher sat in the appointed seat, and without asking them, âDo you indulge in thoughts of wrongdoing?â he addressed them comprehensively and in general terms, âMonks, there is no such thing as a petty wrong. A monk must check all defilements as they each arise. Wise men of old, before the Buddha came, subdued their defilements and attained to the knowledge of a Paccekabuddha.â With these words, he told there a story of the past. 
{4.114}

1. âThe water-draught of my own friend, although a friend, I stole:

Loathing the wrong which I had done, I afterwards was fain

To leave the world, an eremite, lest I do wrong again.â


2. âI looked upon anotherâs wife; lust rose within my soul:

Loathing the wrong which I had done, I afterwards was fain

To leave the world, an eremite, lest I do wrong again.â


3. âThieves caught my father in a wood: to whom I did forth tell

That he was other than he was â a lie, I knew it well:

Loathing the wrong which I had done, I afterwards was fain

To leave the world, an eremite, lest I do wrong again.â


4. âThe people at a drinking-feast full many beasts did kill,

And not against my will:

Loathing the wrong which I had done, I afterwards was fain

To leave the world, an eremite, lest I do wrong again.â


5. âThose persons who in former times of liquors drank their fill,

Now carried out a drinking-bout, whence many suffered ill, 
{4.117}

And not against my will:

Loathing the wrong which I had done, I afterwards was fain

To leave the world, an eremite, lest I do wrong again.â

6. âCome, out on lust, I say, unsavoury, thorn-beset!

Never, though long I followed wrong, such joy as this I met!â 
{4.118}

7. âGreat is the joy of sweet desire: no greater joy than love:

Who follow this attain the bliss of paradise above!â

8. âIll-tasting, painful is desire, there is no worser woe:

Who follow wrong are sure to win the pains of hell below.


9. Than sword well whetted, or a blade implacable, athirst,

Than knives deep driven in the heart, desires are more accursed.


10. A pit as deep as men are tall, where live coals blazing are,

A ploughshare heated in the sun â desires are worser far.


11. A poison very venomous, an oil of little ease, 
âExtracted oilâ? (cf. 
SuÅruta
, i. 181). Apparently some kind of poison.

Or that vile thing to copper clings 
Verdigris.
 â desires are worse than these.â 
{4.119}

The Teacher, having ended this discourse, added, âMonks, there is no such thing as a petty wrong: the very smallest wrong must be checked by a wise man.â Then he declared the Truths, and identified the JÄtaka; now at the conclusion of the Truths the five hundred monks became Arahats. âAt that time the Paccekabuddhas attained NibbÄna, RÄhulaâs mother was the queen consort, and I myself was the king.â

Buddhaâs retirement from the world: Hardy, 
Manual,

Buddhism in Translations,
 Â§ 6.


One day the monks had assembled in the Dhamma Hall. âMonks,â one would say to his fellow, âthe One with Ten Powers might have dwelt in a house, he might have been a Universal Monarch in the centre of the great world, possessed of the Seven Precious Things, glorious with the Four Paths to Power, 
See iii. 454 (p. 272 of this translation).
 surrounded with sons more than a thousand! Yet all this magnificence he renounced when he perceived the bane that lies in desires. At midnight, with Channa in company, he mounted his horse Kanthaka, and departed: on the banks of AnomÄ, the River Glorious, he renounced the world, and for six years he tormented himself with austerities, and then attained to perfect wisdom.â Thus they talked of the Buddhaâs virtues. The Teacher entering, asked, âWhat are you speaking of now, monks, as you sit here?â They told him. Said the Teacher, âThis is not the first time, monks, that the TathÄgata has made the Great Renunciation. In days of yore he retired and gave up the kingdom of Benares City, which was twelve leagues in extent.â So saying, he told a story of the past.

1. âI greet the lord of charioteers with friends and courtiers by:

The world, O king! I would renounce: let not my lord deny.â

2. âIf aught you crave, YuvaÃ±jana, I will fulfil it quite:

If any hurt you, I protect: be you no eremite.â 
{4.121}

3. âNo man there is that does me harm, my wishes nothing lack;

But I would seek a refuge, where old age makes no attack.â

4a. âThe son speaks to his father thus, the father to his son,â

4b. âLeave not the world, O prince! So cry the townsfolk every one.â 
[4.77]

5. âO do not from the unworldly life, great monarch, make me stay,

Lest I, intoxicate with sensual desires, to age become a prey!â

6. âI beg you, it is I, my dear, and I would make you stay!

Long wish I you, my son, to see, O do not go away!â 
{4.122}

7. âLike as the dew upon the grass, when the sun rises hot,

So is the life of mortal men, O mother, stay me not!â

8. âLet those that bear this litter, lift, let not my mother stay

Me, mighty king! From entering upon my holy way.â 
Tarati
 means technically to âflee from the City of Destruction.â

9. âMake haste, and bless you! Empty now is Rammaka, I know;

King Sabbadatta has allowed YuvaÃ±jana to go. 
{4.123}


10. The eldest of a thousand, he, like gold to look upon,

This mighty prince has left the world the yellow robe to don.â

11. âYuvaÃ±jana, Yudhiá¹­á¹­hila, in holy life remain:

Their father and their mother left, they break in two deathâs chain.â

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he said: âThis is not the first time, monks, that the TathÄgata renounced a kingdom to follow the ascetic life, but it was the same before,â then he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time members of the present kingâs family were the father and mother, Änanda was Yudhiá¹­á¹­hila, and I was YuvaÃ±jana myself.â

## Full Story
âLet Lakkhaá¹a.â
 This story the Teacher told in Jetavana about a landowner whose father was dead. This man on his fatherâs death was overwhelmed with sorrow: leaving all his duties undone, he gave himself up to his sorrow wholly. The Teacher at dawn of day looking out upon mankind, perceived that he was ripe for attaining the fruit of the First Path. Next day, after going his rounds for alms in SÄvatthi, his meal done, he dismissed the monks, and taking with him a junior monk, 
{4.124}
 went to this manâs house, and gave him greeting, and addressed him as he sat there in words of honey sweetness. âYou are in sorrow, lay brother?â said he. âYes, sir, afflicted with sorrow for my fatherâs sake.â Said the Teacher, âLay brother, wise men of old who exactly knew the eight conditions of this world, 
Gain and loss, fame and dishonour, praise and blame, bliss and woe.
 felt at a fatherâs death no grief, not even a little.â Then at his request he told a story of the past.

1a. âLet Lakkhaá¹a and SÄ«tÄ both into that pond descend.â

1b. âBharata says, king Dasarathaâs life is at an end.â

2. âSay by what power you grievest not, RÄma, when grief should be?

Though it is said your sire is dead grief overwhelms not thee!â

3. âWhen man can never keep a thing, though loudly he may cry,

Why should a wise intelligence torment itself thereby? 
{4.127}


4. The young in years, the older grown, the fool, and yes, the wise,

For rich, for poor one end is sure: each man among them dies.


5. As sure as for the ripened fruit there comes the fear of fall,

So surely comes the fear of death to mortals one and all.


6. Who in the morning light are seen by evening oft are gone,

And seen at evening time, is gone by morning many a one.


7. If to a fool infatuate a blessing could accrue

When he torments himself with tears, the wise this same would do.


8. By this tormenting of himself he waxes thin and pale;

This cannot bring the dead to life, and nothing tears avail.


9. Even as a blazing house may be put out with water, so

The strong, the wise, the intelligent, who well the scriptures know,

Scatter their grief like cotton when the stormy winds do blow.


10. One mortal dies â to kindred ties born is another straight:

Each creatureâs bliss dependent is on ties associate.


11. The strong man therefore, skilled in sacred text,

Keen-contemplating this world and the next,

Knowing their nature, not by any grief,

However great, in mind and heart is vexed.


12. So to my kindred I will give, them will I keep and feed,

All that remain I will maintain: such is the wise manâs deed.â 
The commentator quotes on p. 129 a verse which occurred in the KÄlabÄhu Birth, No. 329 (vol. iii. p. 66 of this translation), beginning âGain and lossâ.

13. âYears sixty times a hundred, and ten thousand more, all told,

Reigned strong-armed RÄma, on his neck the lucky triple fold.â 
KambugÄ«vo:
 three folds on the neck, like shell-spirals, were a token of luck.

The Teacher having ended this discourse, declared the Truths, and identified the JÄtaka, now at the conclusion of the Truths, the landowner was established in the fruit of the First Path. âAt that time the king Suddhodana was king Dasaratha, MahÄmÄyÄ 
Gotama Buddhaâs father and mother.
 was the mother, RÄhulÄâs mother 
Gotama Buddhaâs wife.
 was SÄ«tÄ, Änanda was Bharata, and I myself was RÄmapaá¹á¸ita.â

## Full Story
âYour nature, mighty monarch.â
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling in Jetavana, about a monk who had ceased to strive. This, we learn, was a young man of family, who lived in SÄvatthi. Having heard the Teacherâs discoursing, he renounced the world. Fulfilling the tasks imposed by his teachers and preceptors, he learned by heart both the PÄtimokkhas.
 [4.83]


When five years were past, he said: âWhen I have been instructed in the mode of attaining Absorption, I will go dwell in the forest.â Then he took leave of his teachers and preceptors, and proceeded to a frontier village in the kingdom of Kosala. The people were pleased with his behaviour, 
{4.131}
 and he made a hut of leaves and there was attended to.


Entering upon the rainy season, zealous, eager, striving in strenuous endeavour he strove after Absorption for the space of three months, but of this not a trace could he produce. Then he thought: âVerily I am the most devoted to worldly conditions 
An arhat is called 
apado,
 sc. devoid of conditions for rebirth, such as human passion, desire, karma, kleÅa, &c. (Childers, p. 313); 
padaparamo
 seems to mean the opposite.
 among the four classes of men taught by the Teacher! What have I to do with living in the forest?â Then he said to himself, âI will return to Jetavana, 
The quotation should include 
Jetavanaá¹ gantvÄ,
 as is shown by line 7.
 and there in beholding the beauty of the TathÄgata, and hearing his discourse sweet as honey, I will pass my days.â So he relaxed his striving; and setting forth he came in course of time to Jetavana.


His preceptors and teachers, his friends and acquaintances asked him the cause of his coming. He informed them, and they reproved him for it, asking him why he had done so. Then they led him into the Teacherâs presence. âWhy, monks,â said the Teacher, âdo you lead here a monk against his will?â They replied, âThis monk has come here because he has relaxed his striving.â âIs this true, as they tell me?â asked the Teacher. âYes, sir,â said the man. Said the Teacher, âWhy have you ceased to strive, monk? For a weak and slothful man there is in this dispensation no high fruition, no becoming an Arahat, they only who make strenuous effort accomplish this. In days long gone by you were full of strength, easy to teach, and in this way, though the youngest of all the hundred sons of the king of Benares, by holding fast to the admonition of wise men you obtained the white umbrella.â So saying, he told a story of the past.

1. âYour nature, mighty monarch, sure the lord of men well knew;

The other princes honoured he, but nothing gave to you.


2. While the king lived was it, or when a god to heaven he went,

That seeing their own benefit, your kinsmen gave consent?


3. Say by what power, O Saá¹vara, you stand above your kin:

Why do your brothers not unite from you the place to win?â

4. âBecause, O prince, I never grudge great sages what is meet;

Ready to pay them honour due, I fall before their feet.


5. Me envying none, and apt to learn all conduct meet and right,

Wise sages each good precept teach in which they take delight.


6. I listen to the bidding of these sages great and wise;

My heart is bent to good intent, no counsel I despise.


7. Elephant troops and chariotmen, guard royal, infantry,

I took no toll of daily dole, but paid them all their fee.


8. Great nobles and wise counsellors waiting on me are found;

With food, wine, water (so they boast) Benares does abound. 
{4.135}


9. Thus merchants prosper, and from many a realm they come and go,

And I protect them. Now the truth, Uposatha, you know.â

10. âThen be above your kith and kin, and rule in righteousness,

So wise and prudent, Saá¹vara, your brothers you shall bless.


11. Your treasure-heaps your brothers will defend, and you shall be

Safe from your foes as Sakkaâs self from his arch enemy.â 
The king of the Asuras.
 [4.86] {4.136}

The Teacher, having finished this discourse, added, âLong ago, monk, you followed instruction, and why do you not now sustain your effort?â Then he declared the Truths and identified the JÄtaka, now at the conclusion of the Truths this monk was established in the fruit of the First Path. âAt that time this monk was the great king Saá¹vara, SÄriputta was prince Uposatha, the elders and secondary elders were the other brothers, the Buddhaâs followers were their followers, and I myself was the courtier who advised the king.â

âMen with razor pointed.â
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana, about the Perfection of Wisdom.


One day, we are told, at evening, the monks were awaiting the coming of the TathÄgata to preach to them, and as they sat in the Dhamma Hall, they were saying one to another, âVerily, monks, the Teacher has great wisdom! Wide wisdom! Ready wisdom! Swift wisdom! Sharp wisdom! Penetrating wisdom! His wisdom hits on the right plan for the right moment; wide as the world, like a mighty unfathomable ocean, as the heavens spread abroad; in all JambudÄ«pa no wise man exists who can match the One with Ten Powers. As a billow that rises upon the great sea cannot reach the shore, or if it reaches the shore it breaks; 
{4.137}
 so no man can reach the One with Ten Powers in wisdom, or if he comes to the Teacherâs feet he is broken.â In these words they sang the praises of the One with Ten Powersâ Perfection of Wisdom. The Teacher came in, and asked, âWhat are you talking of, monks, as you sit here?â They told him. He said: âNot only now is the TathÄgata full of wisdom. In former days, even when his knowledge was immature, he was wise. Blind though he was, he knew by the signs of the ocean that in the ocean such and such a jewel was hid.â Then he told a story of the past.

1. âMen with razor-pointed noses rising up and diving down!

Speak, SuppÄraka, and tell us by what name this sea is known?â

2. âMerchants come from Bharukaccha, seeking riches to purvey,

This is KhuramÄli ocean where your ship has gone astray.â

Speak, SuppÄraka, and tell us what the name of this may be?â

13. âSince I can myself remember, since intelligence first grew,

Not one life of living creature have I taken, that I knew;

May this ship return to safety if my solemn words are true!â

The Teacher, having ended this discourse, said: âThen, monks, the TathÄgata was most wise in former days, as he is now,â and identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the Buddhaâs company were the company (of merchants), and I myself was the wise SuppÄraka.â

## Full Story
âWho are you.â
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling in Jetavana about doing good to oneâs kith and kin. At SÄvatthi in the house of AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika there was always unfailing food for five hundred monks, and the same with VisÄkhÄ 
A famous female disciple, for whose history see Hardy, 
Manual,
 220 ff.
 and the king of Kosala. But in the kingâs palace, various and fine as was the fare given, no one was friendly to the monks. The result was that the monks never ate in the palace, but they took their food and went off to eat it at the house of AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika or VisÄkhÄ or some other of their trusted friends.


One day the king said: âA present has been brought; take this to the monks,â and sent it to the refectory. An answer was brought that no monks were there in the refectory. âWhere are they gone?â he asked. They were sitting in their friendsâ houses to eat, was the reply. So the king after his morning meal came into the Teacherâs presence, and asked him, âGood sir, what is the best kind of food?â âThe food of friendship is the best, great king,â said he, âeven sour rice-gruel given by a friend becomes sweet.â âWell, sir, and with whom do the monks find friendship?â âWith their kindred, great king, or with the Sakya families.â Then the king thought, what if he were to make a Sakya girl his queen-consort; then the monks would be his friends, as it were with their own kindred. 
{4.145}


So rising from his seat, he returned to the palace, and sent a message 
[4.92]
 to Kapilavatthu 
Headquarters of the Sakya clan, and Buddhaâs birthplace.
 to this effect, âPlease give me one of your daughters in marriage, for I wish to become connected with your family.â On receipt of this message the Sakyas gathered together and deliberated. âWe live in a place subject to the authority of the king of Kosala; if we refuse a daughter, he will be very angry, and if we give her, the custom of our clan will be broken. What are we to do?â Then MahÄnÄma 
A Sakya prince: see Hardy, 
Manual,
 227.
 said to them, âDo not trouble about it. I have a daughter, named VÄsabhakhattiyÄ. Her mother is a slave woman, NÄgamuá¹á¸Ä by name; she is some sixteen years of age, of great beauty and auspicious prospects, and by her fatherâs side noble. 
Khattiya
.
 We will send her, as a girl nobly born.â The Sakyas agreed, and sent for the messengers, and said they were willing to give a daughter of the clan, and that they might take her with them at once. But the messengers reflected: âThese Sakyas are desperately proud, in matters of birth. Suppose they should send a girl who was not of them, and say that she was so? We will take none but one who eats along with them.â So they replied, âWell, we will take her, but we will take one who eats along with you.â


The Sakyas assigned a lodging for the messengers, and then wondered what to do. MahÄnÄma said: âNow do not trouble about it; I will find a way. At my mealtime bring in VÄsabhakhattiyÄ dressed up in her finery; then just as I have taken one mouthful, produce a letter, and say, âMy lord, such a king has sent you a letter; be pleased to hear his message at once.â â


They agreed; and as he was taking his meal they dressed and adorned the maid. âBring my daughter,â said MahÄnÄma, âand let her take food with me.â âIn a moment,â they said, âas soon as she is properly adorned,â and after a short delay they brought her in. Expecting to take food with her father, she dipped her hand into the same dish. MahÄnÄma had taken one mouthful with her, and put it in his mouth; but just as he stretched out his hand for another, they brought him a letter, saying: âMy lord, such a king has sent a letter to you: be pleased to hear his message at once.â Said MahÄnÄma, âGo on with your meal, my dear,â 
{4.146}
 and holding his right hand in the dish, with his left took the letter and looked at it. As he examined the message the maiden went on eating. When she had eaten, he washed his hand and rinsed out his mouth. The messengers were firmly convinced that she was his daughter, for they did not divine the secret.


So MahÄnÄma sent away his daughter in great pomp. The messengers brought her to SÄvatthi, and said that this maiden was the true-born daughter of MahÄnÄma. The king was pleased, and caused the whole city to be decorated, and placed her upon a pile of treasure, and by a ceremonial sprinkling made her his chief queen. She was dear to the king, and beloved.


In a short time the queen conceived, and the king caused the proper treatment to be used; and at the end of ten months, she brought forth a son whose colour was a golden brown. On the day of his naming, the king sent a message to his grandmother, saying: âA son has been born to VÄsabhakhattiyÄ, daughter of the Sakya king; what shall his name be?â Now the courtier who was charged with this message was slightly deaf; but he went and told the kingâs grandmother. When she heard it, she said: âEven when VÄsabhakhattiyÄ had never borne a son, she was more than all the world; and now she will be the kingâs darling.â 
VallabhÄ
.
 The deaf man did not hear the word âdarlingâ aright, but thought she said: âViá¸Å«á¸abha,â so back he went to the king, and told him that he was to name the prince Viá¸Å«á¸abha. This, the king thought, must be some ancient family name, and so named him Viá¸Å«á¸abha. After this the prince grew up and was treated as a prince should be.


When he was at the age of seven years, having observed how the other princes received presents of toy elephants and horses and other toys from the family of their mothersâ fathers, the lad said to his mother, âMother, the 
[4.93]
 rest of them get presents from their mothersâ family, but no one sends me anything. Are you an orphan?â Then she replied, âMy boy, your grandfathers are the Sakya kings, but they live a long way off, and that is why they send you nothing.â Again when he was sixteen, he said: âMother, I want to see your fatherâs family.â âDonât speak of it, child,â she said. âWhat will you do when you get there?â But though she put him off, he asked her again and again. At last his mother said, 
{4.147}
 âWell, go then.â So the lad got his fatherâs consent, and set out with a number of followers. VÄsabhakhattiyÄ sent on a letter before him to this effect, âI am living here happily; let not my masters tell him anything of the secret.â But the Sakyas, on hearing of the coming of Viá¸Å«á¸abha, sent off all their young children into the country. âIt is impossible,â they said, âto receive him with respect.â


When the prince arrived at Kapilavatthu, the Sakyas had assembled in the royal rest-house. The prince approached the rest house, and waited. Then they said to him, âThis is your motherâs father, this is her brother,â pointing them out. He walked from one to the other, saluting them. But although he bowed to them till his back ached, not one of them vouchsafed a greeting; so he asked, âWhy is it that none of you greet me?â The Sakyas replied, âMy dear, the youngest princes are all in the country,â then they entertained him grandly.


After a few days stay, he set out for home with all his retinue. Just then a slave woman washed the seat which he had used in the rest house with milk-water, saying insultingly, âHereâs the seat where sat the son of VÄsabhakhattiyÄ, the slave girl!â A man who had left his spear behind was just fetching it, when he overheard the abuse of prince Viá¸Å«á¸abha. He asked what it meant. He was told that VÄsabhakhattiyÄ was born of a slave to MahÄnÄma the Sakya. This he told to the soldiers; a great uproar arose, all shouting, âVÄsabhakhattiyÄ is a slave womanâs daughter, so they say!â The prince heard it. âYes,â he thought, âlet them pour milk-water over the seat I sat in, to wash it! When I am king, I will wash the place with the blood of the hearts!â


When he returned to SÄvatthi, the courtiers told the whole matter to the king. The king was enraged against the Sakyas for giving him a slaveâs daughter to marry. He cut off all allowances made to VÄsabhakhattiyÄ and her son, and gave them only what is proper to be given to slave men and women.


Some few days later the Teacher came to the palace, and took a seat. The king approached him, and with a greeting said: âSir, I am told that your clansmen gave me a slaveâs daughter to marry. I have cut off their allowances, mother and son, and grant them only what slaves would get.â Said the Teacher, âThe Sakyas have done wrong, O great king! 
{4.148}
 If they gave any one, they ought to have given a girl of their own blood. But, O king, this I say: VÄsabhakhattiyÄ is a kingâs daughter, and in the house of a noble king she has received the ceremonial sprinkling; Viá¸Å«á¸abha too was begotten by a noble king. Wise men of old have said, what matters the motherâs birth? The birth of the father is the measure; and to a poor wife, a picker of sticks, they gave the position of queen consort; and the son born of her obtained the sovereignty of Benares, twelve leagues in extent, and became king Kaá¹­á¹­havÄhana, the wood-carrier,â whereupon he told him the story of the Kaá¹­á¹­hahÄrijÄtaka [Ja 7].


When the king heard this speech he was pleased; and saying to himself, âThe fatherâs birth is the measure of the man,â he again gave mother and son the treatment suited to them.


Now the kingâs commander-in-chief was a man named Bandhula. His wife, MallikÄ, was barren, and he sent her away to KusinÄra, telling her to return to her own family. âI will go,â said she, âwhen I have saluted the Teacher.â She went to Jetavana, and greeting the TathÄgata stood waiting on one side. âWhere are you going?â he asked. She replied, âMy husband has sent me home, sir.â âWhy?â asked the Teacher. âI am barren, sir, I have no son.â âIf that is all,â said he, âthere is no reason why you should go. Return.â She was much pleased, and saluting the Teacher went home again. Her husband 
[4.94]
 asked her why she had come back. She answered, âThe One with Ten Powers sent me back, my lord.â âThen,â said the commander-in-chief, âthe TathÄgata must have seen good reason.â The woman soon after conceived, and when her cravings began, told him of it. âWhat is it you want?â he asked. âMy lord,â said she, âI desire to go and bathe and drink the water of the tank in VesÄli City where the families of the kings get water for the ceremonial sprinkling.â The commander-in-chief promised to try. Seizing his bow, strong as a thousand bows, he put his wife in a chariot, and left SÄvatthi, and drove his chariot to VesÄlÄ«.


Now at this time there lived close to the gate a Licchavi named MahÄli, 
Called MahÄlicchavi in Dhp (p. 219).
 who had been educated by the same teacher as the king of Kosalaâs general, Bandhula. This man was blind, and used to advise the Licchavis on all matters temporal and spiritual. Hearing the clatter of the chariot as it went over the threshold, he said: âThe noise of the chariot of Bandhula the Mallian! 
{4.149}
 This day there will be fear for the Licchavis!â By the tank there was set a strong guard, within and without; above it was spread an iron net; not even a bird could find room to get through. But the general, dismounting from his carriage, put the guards to flight with the blows of his sword, and burst through the iron network, and in the tank bathed his wife and gave her to drink of the water; then after bathing himself, he set MallikÄ in the chariot, and left the town, and went back by the way he came.


The guards went and told all to the Licchavis. Then were the kings of the Licchavis angry; and five hundred of them, mounted in five hundred chariots, departed to capture Bandhula the Mallian. They informed MahÄli of it, and he said: âGo not! For he will slay you all.â But they said: âNay, but we will go.â âThen if you come to a place where a wheel has sunk up to the nave, you must return. If you return not then, return back from that place when you hear the noise of a thunderbolt. If then you turn not, turn back from that place where you shall see a hole in front of your chariots. Go no further!â But they did not turn back according to his word, but pursued on and on.


MallikÄ espied them and said: âThere are chariots in sight, my lord.â âThen tell me,â said he, âwhen they all look like one chariot.â When they all in a line looked like one, she said: âMy lord, I see as it were the head of one chariot.â âTake the reins, then,â said he, and gave the reins into her hand; he stood upright in the chariot, and strung his bow. The chariot-wheel sank into the earth nave-deep. The Licchavis came to the place, and saw it, but turned not back. The other went on a little further, and twanged the bow string; then came a noise as the noise of a thunderbolt, yet even then they turned not, but pursued on and on. Bandhula stood up in the chariot and sped a shaft, and it cleft the heads of all the five hundred chariots, and passed right through the five hundred kings in the place where the girdle is fastened, and then buried itself in the earth. As they did not perceive that they were wounded they pursued still, shouting, âStop, holloa, stop!â Bandhula stopped his chariot, and said: âYou are dead men, and I cannot fight with the dead.â âWhat!â they said, âdead, such as we now are?â âLoose the girdle of the first man,â said Bandhula. 
{4.150}


They loosed his girdle, and at the instant the girdle was loosed, he fell dead. Then he said to them, âYou are all of you in the same condition; go to your homes, and set in order what should be ordered, and give your directions to your wives and families, and then doff your armour.â They did so, and then all of them gave up the ghost. 
This is a variation of a well-known incident. A headsman slices off a manâs head so skilfully, that the victim does not know it is done. The victim then takes a pinch of snuff, sneezes, and his head falls off. Another form is: Two men dispute, and one swings his sword round. They go on talking, and by and bye the other gets up to depart, and falls in two parts.


And Bandhula conveyed MallikÄ to SÄvatthi. She bore twin sons sixteen times in succession, and they were all mighty men and heroes, and became perfected in all manner of accomplishments. Each one of them had a thousand 
[4.95]
 men to attend him, and when they went with their father to wait on the king, they alone filled the courtyard of the palace to overflowing.


One day some men who had been defeated in court on a false charge, seeing Bandhula approach, raised a great outcry, and informed him that the judges of the court had supported a false charge. So Bandhula went into the court, and judged the case, and gave each man his own. The crowd uttered loud shouts of applause. The king asked what it meant, and on hearing was much pleased; all those officers he sent away, and gave Bandhula charge of the judgement court, and thenceforward he judged aright. Then the former judges became poor, because they no longer received bribes, and they slandered Bandhula in the kingâs ear, accusing him of aiming at the kingdom himself. The king listened to their words, and could not control his suspicions. âBut,â he reflected, âif he be slain here, I shall be blamed.â He instigated certain men to harry the frontier districts; then sending for Bandhula, he said: âThe borders are in a blaze; go with your sons and capture the brigands.â With him he also sent other men sufficient, mighty men of war, with instructions to kill him and his two-and-thirty sons, and cut off their heads, and bring them back.


While he was yet on the way, the hired brigands got wind of the generalâs coming, and took to flight. He settled the people of that district in their homes, and quieted the province, and set out for home. Then when he was not far from the city, those warriors cut off his head and the heads of his sons.


On that day MallikÄ had sent an invitation to the two chief disciples along with five hundred of the monks. Early in the forenoon a letter was brought to her, with news that her husband and sons had lost their heads. 
{4.151}
 When she heard this, without a word to a soul, she tucked the letter in her dress, and waited upon the company of the monks. Her attendants had given rice to the monks, when bringing in a bowl of ghee they happened to break the bowl just in front of the elders. Then the Captain of the Dhamma said: âPots are made to be broken; do not trouble about it.â The lady produced her letter from the fold of her dress, saying: âHere I have a letter informing me that my husband and his two-and-thirty sons have been beheaded. If I do not trouble about that, am I likely to trouble when a bowl is broken?â The Captain of the Dhamma now began, âUnseen, unknown,â 
Snp. 574, 
Sallasutta
: âUnseen, unknown, is the life of men here below:â and so forth, for twenty verses. 
 and so forth, then rising from his seat uttered a discourse, and went home.


She summoned her two-and-thirty daughters-in-law, and to them said: âYour husbands, though innocent, have reaped the fruit of their former deeds. Do not you grieve, nor commit a wrong worse even than the kingâs.â This was her advice. The kingâs spies hearing this speech brought word to him that they were not angry. Then the king was distressed, and went to her dwelling, and craving pardon of MallikÄ and her sonsâ wives, offered a boon. She replied, âBe it accepted.â She set out the funeral feast, and bathed, and then went before the king. âMy lord,â said she, âyou granted me a boon. I want nothing but this, that you permit my two-and-thirty daughters-in-law and me to go back to our own homes.â The king consented. Each of her two-and-thirty sonsâ wives she sent away to her home, and herself returned to the home of her family in the city of KusinÄra. And the king gave the post of commander-in-chief to one DÄ«gha-kÄrÄyana, sisterâs son to the general Bandhula. But he went about picking faults in the king and saying: âHe murdered my uncle.â


Ever after the murder of the innocent Bandhula the king was devoured by remorse, and had no peace of mind, felt no joy in being king.


At that time the Teacher dwelt near a country town of the Sakyas, named Uá¸·umpa. There went the king, pitched a camp not far from the park, and with a few attendants went to the monastery to salute the Teacher. The five symbols of royalty 
See above, p. 80 note.
 he handed to KÄrÄyana, and alone entered the Perfumed Chamber. All that followed must be described as in the Dhammacetiyasutta [MN 89]. When he 
[4.96]
 entered the Perfumed Chamber, KÄrÄyana took those symbols of royalty, 
{4.152}
 and made Viá¸Å«á¸abha king; and leaving behind for the king one horse and a serving woman, he went to SÄvatthi.


After a pleasant conversation with the Teacher, the king on his return saw no army. He enquired of the woman, and learned what had been done. Then set out for the city of RÄjagaha, resolved to take his nephew with him, 
The quotation should begin at 
bhÄgineyyÄm,
 since the king was alone.
 and capture Viá¸Å«á¸abha. It was late when he came to the city, and the gates were shut; and lying down in a shed, exhausted by exposure to wind and sun, he died there.


When the night began to grow brighter, the woman began to wail, âMy lord, the king of Kosala is past help!â The sound was heard, and news came to the king. He performed the obsequies of his uncle with great magnificence.


Viá¸Å«á¸abha once firmly established on the throne remembered that grudge of his, and determined to destroy the Sakyas one and all; to which end he set out with a large army. That day at dawn the Teacher, looking forth over the world, saw destruction threatening his kin. âI must help my kindred,â thought he. In the forenoon he went in search of alms, then after returning from his meal lay down lion-like in his Perfumed Chamber, and in the evening-time, having past through the air to a spot near Kapilavatthu, sat beneath a tree that gave scanty shade. Hard by that place, a huge and shady banyan tree stood on the boundary of Viá¸Å«á¸abhaâs realms. Viá¸Å«á¸abha seeing the Teacher approached and saluting him, said: âWhy, sir, are you sitting under so thin a tree in all this heat? Sit beneath this shady banyan, sir.â He replied, âLet be, O king! The shade of my kindred keeps me cool.â âThe Teacher,â thought the other, âmust have come here to protect his clansmen.â So he saluted the Teacher, and returned again to SÄvatthi. And the Teacher rising went to Jetavana.


A second and a third time the king called to mind his grudge against the Sakyas, a second and a third time he set forth, and again saw the Teacher seated in the same place, then again returned.


A fourth time he set out; and the Teacher, scanning the former deeds of the Sakyas, perceived that nothing could do away with the effect of their evildoing, in casting poison into the river; so he did not go there the fourth time. Then king Viá¸Å«á¸abha slew all the Sakyas, beginning with babes at the breast, and with the blood of the hearts washed the bench, and returned.


On the day after the Teacher had gone out for the third time and returned, he, 
{4.153}
 having gone his rounds for alms, and his meal over, was resting in his Perfumed Chamber, the monks gathered from all directions into the Dhamma Hall, and seating themselves, began to tell of the virtues of the Great Being, âSirs, the Teacher but showed himself, and turned the king back, and set free his kinsmen from fear of death. A helpful friend is the Teacher to his clan!â The Teacher entered, and asked what they talked about as they sat there. They told him. Then he said: âNot only now, monks, does the TathÄgata act for the benefit of his kinsmen; he did the same long ago.â With these words, he told a story of the past.

1. âWho are you, standing high in air, with heavenly vesture swathed:

Whence come your fears, why flow the tears in which thine eyes are bathed?â

2. âWithin your realm, O king, they know me as the Lucky Tree:

For sixty thousand years I stood, and all have worshipped me.


3. Though many a town and house they made, and many a kingâs dwelling,

Yet me they never did molest, to me no harm did bring:

Then even as they did worship pay, so worship you, O king!â 
{4.155}

4. âBut such another mighty trunk I never yet did see,

So fine a kind in girth and height, so thick and strong a tree.


5. A lovely palace I will build, one column for support;

There I will place you to abide â your life shall not be short.â 
[4.98]

6. âSince you are bent to tear my body from me, cut me small,

And cut me piecemeal limb from limb, O king, or not at all.

7. Cut first the top, the middle next, then last the root of me:

And if you cut me so, O king, death not will painful be.â

8. âFirst hands and feet, then nose and ears, while yet the victim lives,

And last of all the head let fall â a painful death this gives.


9. O Lucky Tree! O woodland king! What pleasure couldst you feel,

Why, for what reason do you wish to be cut up piecemeal?â

10. âThe reason (and a reason âtis full noble) why piecemeal

I would be cut, O mighty king! Come listen while I tell.


11. My kith and kin all prospering round me well-sheltered grow;

These I should crush by one huge fall â and great would be their woe.â

12. âO Lucky Tree! O woodland king! Your thoughts must noble be;

You would befriend your kindred, so from fear I set you free.â

In the present both Devadatta and the families that supported him are doomed through their opposition to the Buddha. The latter tells a story of some carpenters who, having sailed to an island, offended the Yakkhas who inhabited the place, who then threatened to destroy them; some listened and some ignored the warnings and were destroyed by a tsunami.

âOthers sow.â
 
{4.158}
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana, about Devadatta, when he had gone down into hell, taking with him five hundred families. 
[4.99]


Now Devadatta, when the chief disciples 
SÄriputta and MoggallÄna.
 had gone away, taking his followers with them, 
cf. Hardy, 
Buddhism,
 p. 328.
 being unable to swallow his pain, spat up hot blood from his mouth, and departed; then tormented by great agony, as he remembered the virtues of the TathÄgata, he said to himself, âFor nine months I have thought evil of the TathÄgata, but in the Teacherâs heart is never a sinful thought for me; in the eighty chief elders is no malice towards me; by my own deeds that I have done I am become all forlorn, and I am renounced by the Teacher, by the great elders, by elder RÄhula chief of my family, 
Devadatta was brother-in-law of the Buddha.
 and by all the royal clans of the Sakyas. I will go to the Teacher, and reconcile myself with him.â So beckoning to his followers, he caused himself to be carried in a litter, and travelling always by night he made his way to the city of Kosala.


Änanda the elder told the Teacher, saying: âDevadatta is coming, they say, to make his peace with you.â âÄnanda, Devadatta shall not see me.â Again when he had arrived at the city of SÄvatthi, the elder told it to the Teacher; and the Fortunate One replied as before. When he was at the gate of Jetavana, and moving towards the Jetavana lake, his wrongdoing came to a head: a fever arose in his body, and desiring to bathe and drink, he commanded them to let him out of the litter, that he might drink. No sooner had he alighted, and stood upon the ground, and before he could refresh himself, the great earth gaped, a flame arose from the nethermost hell of AvÄ«ci and surrounded him. Then he knew that his wrong deeds had come to a head, and remembering the virtues of the TathÄgata, he repeated this verse: 
[
MilindapaÃ±hÄ
 4.3.]

With these my bones to that supreme Being,

Marked with one hundred lucky marks, all-seeing,

God, more than God, who manâs bull-spirit tames,

With my soul to Buddha I am fleeing!

But in the very act of taking refuge, he was doomed to the hell AvÄ«ci. And there were five hundred families of his attendants, which families following him reviled the One with Ten Powers, and abused him, and in the AvÄ«ci hell were born, they also. Thus he went to AvÄ«ci, taking with him five hundred families.


So one day they were talking in the Dhamma Hall, âMonk, the sinful Devadatta, 
{4.159}
 through greed of gain, set his anger without cause against the Supreme Buddha, and with no regard for the terrors of the future, with five hundred families was doomed to hell.â The Teacher entered and asked of what they were speaking, and they told him. Said he, âMonks, Devadatta being greedy of gain and honour had no eye for the terrors of the future; and in former times, as now, regarding not the terrors of the future, he with his followers through greed of present happiness came to utter ruin.â So saying, he told them a story.

1. âOthers sow and others plough,

Living by the sweat oâ the brow;

In my realm they have no share:

JambudÄ«pa? This better far!â

2. âIn thrice five days the moon will rise to view:

Then from the sea a mighty flood is due

This mighty island to oâerwhelm: then haste,

Elsewhere take shelter, that it hurt not you.â

3. âTo me by many signs it is made clear,

That mighty ocean flood of which you hear

Shall never this great island overwhelm:

Then take your pleasure, grieve not, never fear.


4. Here you have lit upon a wide abode,

Full of all things to eat, of drink and food;

I see no danger for you: come, enjoy

Unto all generations this your good.â 
{4.163}

5. âThat god, who from the southern quarter clear

Cries out, âAll safe!â From him the truth we hear;

Fear or fear not, the northern knows no whit:

Why grieve, then? Take your pleasure â never fear!â

6. âWhile these two Yakkhas âgainst each other cry,

One calling fear, and one security,

Come hear advice, lest soon and out of hand

You all together perish utterly.


7. Let us join all to build a mighty bark,

A vessel stout, and place within this ark

All fittings: if this southern spoke the truth,

And the other said but folly, off the mark. 
[4.103]


8. This vessel for us good at need shall be;

Nor will we leave this isle incontinent;

But if the northern god spake truthfully,

The southern did but foolishness present â 
{4.164}

Then in the ship we all embark together,

And where our safety lies, all hie us there.


9. Take not for best or worst what first you hear;

But whoso lets all pass within the ear,

And then deliberating takes the mean,

That man to safest harbourage will steer.â 
This metaphor is not in the PÄli.

10. âAs through mid-ocean, by the deeds they did,

The traders they escaped in happiness:

So wise men, comprehending what lies hid

Within the future, will no jot transgress.


11. Fools in their folly, eaten up with greed

Who future dangers do not comprehend,

Sink overwhelmed, in face of present need,

As these in middest-ocean found their end. 
[4.104] {4.166}


12. Accomplish then the deed before the need,

Let not lack hurt me of the needful thing.

Who timely do the necessary deed

Come time, come never into suffering.â

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he said: âNot now for the first time, monks, but formerly also, has Devadatta been ensnared by pleasures of the present, and without a look to the future, has come to destruction with all his companions.â So saying, he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time, Devadatta was the foolish carpenter, KokÄlika was the unrighteous Devaputta that stood in the southern region, SÄriputta was the Devaputta who stood in the northern part, and I was myself the wise carpenter.â

## Full Story
âHe that desires.â
 
{4.167}
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana, about a certain brahmin.


A brahmin, so they say, who dwelt at SÄvatthi, was felling trees on the bank of the AciravatÄ«, in order to cultivate the land. The Teacher, when he visited SÄvatthi for alms, perceiving his destiny, 
i.e. his capacity in the spiritual life.
 went out of his road to talk sweetly with him. âWhat are you doing, brahmin?â he asked. âO Gotama,â said the man, âI am cutting a space free for cultivation.â âVery good,â he replied, âgo on with your work, brahmin.â


In the same manner the Teacher came and talked with him when the felled trunks were all away, and the man was clearing his acre, and again at plowing time, and at making the little embanked squares for water. 
Refer to the following passage in 
VedÄntaparibhÄá¹£Ä
: â
yathÄ taá¸Ägodakaá¹ kulyÄtmanÄ kedÄrÄn praviÅya tadvadeva catuá¹£koá¹ÄdyÄkÄraá¹ bhavati
.â (For this note I am indebted to Prof. Cowell.) See also Sleeman, Rambles &c. ii. 178.
 Now on the day of sowing, the brahmin said: âToday, O Gotama, is my plowing festival. 
There was a great yearly ceremony of this kind, at which the king held the plough; see Hardyâs 
Manual of Buddhism
, p. 150.
 When this corn is ripe, I will give alms in plenty to the Saá¹gha, with the Buddha at their head.â The Teacher accepted his offer, and went away. On another day he came, and saw the brahmin watching the corn. âWhat are you doing, brahmin?â asked he. âWatching the corn, O Gotama!â âVery good, brahmin,â said the Teacher, and away he went. Then the brahmin thought: âHow often Gotama the ascetic comes this way! Without doubt he wants food. Well, food I will give him.â On the day when this thought came into his mind, when he went home, there he found the Teacher come also. Thereat arose in the brahmin a wondrous great confidence.


By and by, when ripe was the corn, the brahmin resolved, tomorrow he would reap the field. But while he lay in bed, in the upper reaches of the AciravatÄ« the rain fell heavily; down came a flood, and carried the whole crop away to the sea, so that not one stalk was left. When the flood 
[4.105]
 subsided, and the brahmin beheld the destruction of his crops, he had not the strength to stand: pressing his hand to his heart â for he was overcome with great sorrow â he went weeping home, and lay down lamenting.


In the morning the Teacher saw this brahmin overwhelmed with his woe, and he thought: âI will be the brahminâs support.â So next day, after his alms-round in SÄvatthi, on his return from receipt of food he sent the monks back to their monastery, and himself with the junior who attended him visited the manâs house. 
{4.168}
 When the brahmin heard of his coming, he took heart, thinking: âMy friend must be come for a kindly talk.â He offered him a seat; the Teacher entering sat upon the seat indicated, and asked, âWhy are you downhearted, brahmin? What has happened to displease you?â âO Gotama!â said the man, âfrom the time that I cut down the trees on the bank of the AciravatÄ«, you know what I have been doing. I have been going about, and promising gifts to you when that crop should be ripe: now a flood has carried off the whole crop, away to the sea, nothing is left at all! Grain has been destroyed to the amount of a hundred wagon-loads, and so I am deep in grief!â âWhy, will what is lost come back for grieving?â âNo, Gotama, that will it not.â âIf that is so, why grieve? The wealth of beings in this world, or their corn, when they have it, they have it, and when it is gone, why, gone it is. No composite thing but is subject to destruction; do not brood over it.â Thus comforting him, the Teacher repeated the KÄma discourse [Snp 4.1] as appropriate to his case. At the conclusion of the discourse, the mourning brahmin was established in the Fruit of the First Path. The Teacher having eased him of his pain, arose from his seat, and returned to the monastery.


All the town heard how the Teacher had found such a brahmin pierced with the pangs of grief, had consoled him and established him in the Fruit of the First Path.


The monks talked of it in the Dhamma Hall, âHear, sirs! The One with Ten Powers made friends with a brahmin, grew intimate, took his opportunity to declare the Dhamma to him, when pierced with the pangs of grief, eased him of pain, and established him in the Fruit of the First Path!â The Teacher came in, and asked, âWhat do you speak of, monks, as you sit here together?â They told him. He replied, âThis is not the first time, monks, I have cured his grief, but I did the same long, long ago,â and with these words he told a story of the past.

1. âHe that desires a thing, and then this his desire fulfilment blesses,

Sure a glad-hearted man is he, because his wish he now possesses. 
[Snp 4.1].


2. He that desires a thing, and then this his desire fulfilment blesses,

Desires throng on him more and more, as thirst in time of heat oppresses.


3. As in the hornÃ©d kine, the horn with their growth larger grows:

So, in a foolish undiscerning man, that nothing knows,

While grows the man, the more and more grows thirst, and craving grows.


4. Give all the rice and corn on earth, slave-men, and kine, and horse,

âTis not enough for one: this know, and keep a righteous course.


5. A king that should subdue the whole world wide,

The whole wide world up to the ocean bound,

With this side of the sea unsatisfied

Would crave what might beyond the sea be found.


6. Brood on desires within the heart â content will neâer arise.

Who turns from these, and the true cure descries,

He is content, whom wisdom satisfies.


7. Best to be full of wisdom: these no lust can set afire;

Never the man with wisdom filled is slave unto desire.


8. Crush your desires, and little want, not greedy all to win:

He that is like the sea is not burnt by desire within,

But like a cobbler, cuts the shoe according to the skin. 
{4.173}


9. For each desire that is let go a happiness is won:

He that all happiness would have, must with all lust have done.â 
{4.174}

10. âEight 
âBeginning with the second, those which explain the misery of desire are eight,â said the Commentator. The first verse, it will be remembered, is a quotation from 
SuttanipÄta
, and possibly may have been added later.
 verses have you uttered, worth a thousand pieces each:

Take, O great brahmin! Take the sum, for sweet is this your speech.â

11. âFor thousands, hundreds, million times a million, 
The number 
nahutaá¹
 is 1 followed by 28 ciphers.
 nought care I:

As the last verse I uttered, in my heart desire did die.â

12. âWise and good is indeed this youth, all the lore of all worlds knowing:

All desire in very truth is mother of misery by his showing.â 
[4.109]

This discourse ended, the Teacher said: âThus, monks, in former days as now, I made this brahmin whole,â so saying, he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time this brahmin was the king, and I was the wise young man.â

âThus spake.â
 
{4.176}
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana, for the instruction of the king of Kosala.


At one time, they say the king, intoxicated with power, and devoted to the pleasures of wrongdoing, held no court of justice, and grew remiss in attending upon the Buddha. One day he remembered the One with Ten Powers; and thought: âI must visit him.â So after breaking his fast, he ascended his magnificent chariot, and proceeding to the monastery, greeted him and took a seat. âHow is it, great king,â asked the Bodhisatta, âthat you have not showed yourself for so long?â âO, sir,â replied the king, âI have been so busy, that there has been no opportunity of waiting upon you.â âGreat king,â said he, âit is not good to neglect such as I am, a Supreme Buddha, who can give admonition, dwelling too in a monastery in front. A king ought to rule vigilant in all kingly duties, to his subjects like mother or father, forsaking all evil courses, never omitting the ten virtues of a king. When a king is righteous, those who surround him are righteous also. No marvel were it, in truth, if under my instruction you were to rule in righteousness; but wise men of old, even when there was no teacher to instruct them, by their own understanding established in the threefold practice of well-doing, declared the Dhamma to a great multitude of people, and with all their attendants went to swell the hosts of heaven.â With these words, at his request, the Teacher told a story of the past.

1. âThus spake king Janasandha: Ten things in truth there be,

Which if a man omit to do, he suffers presently.


2. Not to have got nor gathered store in time, the heart torments;

To think he sought no wealth before he afterwards repents.


3. How hard is life for men untaught! He thinks, repenting sore

That learning, which he now might use, he would not learn before.


4. A slanderer once, dishonest once, a backbiter unkind,

Cruel, and harsh was I: good cause for sorrow now I find. 
{4.178}


5. A slayer was I, merciless, and to no creature gave,

Contemptible: for this (said he) much sorrow now I have.


6. When I had many wives (thinks he) to whom I owed their due,

I left them for anotherâs wife; which now I dearly rue.


7. When plenteous store of food and drink there was, he sorrows sore,

To think he never gave a gift in the old time before.


8. He grieves to think that when he could, he would not care and tend

Mother and father, now grown old, their youth now at an end. 
Compare Snp
,
 vv. 95, 124.
 
[4.111]


9. To have slighted teacher, preceptor, or father, who would try

To gratify his every wish, causes deep misery.


10. To have treated brahmins with neglect, ascetics many a one

Holy, and learned, in the past, makes him repent anon.


11. Sweet is austerity performed, a good man honoured well:

That he did no such thing before âtis sad to have to tell.


12. Who these ten things in wisdom brings to full accomplishment,

And to all men his duty does, will never need repent.â 
{4.180}

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he said: âThus, O great king, wise men of old, untaught and from their own intelligence, declared the Dhamma, and established multitudes in the way to heaven.â With these words, he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the Buddhaâs followers were the people, and I was myself king Janasandha.â

âA black, black hound.â
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana, about living for the benefit of the world.


One day, they say, the monks as they sat in the Dhamma Hall, were talking together. âSirs,â one would say, âthe Teacher, ever practising friendship towards the multitudes of the people, has forsaken an agreeable abode, and lives just for the good of the world. He has attained supreme wisdom, yet of his own accord takes bowl and robe, and goes on a journey of eighteen leagues or more. For the five elders 
The five who accompanied Buddha when he began his life as an ascetic: AÃ±Ã±akoá¹á¸aÃ±Ã±a, Bhaddiya, Vappa, Assaji, MahÄnÄma. 
 he set rolling the Wheel of the Dhamma; on the fifth day of the half-month he recited the Anattalakkhaá¹a discourse, and made them Arahats; he went to Uruveá¸·a, 
He there preached to the fire-worshippers.
 and to the ascetics with matted hair he showed three and a half thousand miracles, and persuaded them to join the Saá¹gha; at GayÄsÄ«sa 
Now Brahmathati, a mountain near GayÄ. 
 he taught the Discourse upon Fire, and made a thousand of these ascetics Arahats; 
[4.112]
 to MahÄkassapa, 
See 
Journal of the Pali Text Society
 1888, p. 67.
 when he had gone forward three miles to meet him, after three discourses he gave the higher ordination; all alone, after the noon-day meal, he went a journey of forty-five leagues, and then established in the Fruit of the Third Path Pukkusa (a youth of very good birth); to meet MahÄkappina he went forward a space of two thousand leagues, and made him an Arahat; alone, in the afternoon he went a journey of thirty leagues, and made that cruel and harsh man Aá¹gulimÄla an Arahat; 
[Aá¹gulimÄla was a brahmin student.]
 thirty leagues also he traversed, and established Äá¸·avaka in the Fruit of the First Path, and saved the prince; in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three he dwelt three months, and taught Abhidhamma to eight hundred millions of deities; 
The beings who dwelt in the three worlds of Brahma were called 
âbrahma.â
 The story alluded to here is given in No. 405 (iii. 219 of this translation); Hardy, 
Manual
, p. 336.
 to the Brahma Realm he went, and destroyed the false Dhamma of Baka Brahma, 
Cp. ii. p. 57 of this translation.
 and made ten thousand Brahmas Arahats; every year he goes on pilgrimage in three districts, and to such men as are capable of receiving, he gives the Refuges, the Precepts, and the Fruits of the different stages; 
{4.181}
 he even acts for the good of NÄgas and Garuá¸·as and the like, in many ways.â


In such words they praised the goodness and worth of the One with Ten Powersâ life for the good of the world. The Teacher came in, and asked what they talked about as they sat there? They told him. âAnd no wonder, monks,â said he. âI who now in my perfect wisdom would live for the worldâs good, even I in the past, in the days of passion, lived for the good of the world.â So saying, he told a story of the past.

1. âA black, black hound, with five cords bound, with fangs all white of hue,

Majestic, awful â mighty one! What makes he here with you?â

2. âNot to hunt game the Black Hound came, but he shall be of use

To punish men, UsÄ«nara, when I shall let him loose.â

3. âWhen the false monks, bowl in hand, in one robe clad, shall choose

Tonsured the plough to follow, then the Black Hound I will loose.


4. When nuns of the Saá¹gha shall in single robe be found,

Tonsured, yet walking in the world, I will let loose the Hound.


5. What time ascetics, usurers, protruding the upper lip,

Foul-toothed and filthy-haired shall be â the Black Hound Iâll let slip.


6. When brahmins, skilled in sacred books and holy rites, shall use

Their skill to sacrifice for pelf, the Black Hound shall go loose.


7. Whoso his parents now grown old, their youth now come to an end,

Would not maintain, although he might, 
Thus far the two verses occur in Snp
,
 98 and 124.
 âgainst him the Hound Iâll send.


8. Who to his parents now grown old, their youth now come to an end,

Cries, âFools are you!â âgainst such as he the Black Hound I will send.


9. When men go after othersâ wives, of teacher, or of friend,

Sister of father, uncleâs wife, the Black Hound I will send.


10. When shield on shoulder, sword in hand, full-armed as highway men

They take the road to kill and rob, Iâll loose the Black Hound then.


11. When widowsâ sons, with skin groomed white, in skill all useless found,

Strong-armed, shall quarrel and shall fight, then I will loose the Hound.


12. When men with hearts of evil full, false and deceitful men,

Walk in and out the world about, Iâll loose the Black Hound then.â 
{4.186}

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he added, âThus, monks, in former times as now I have lived for the good of the world,â and then he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time Änanda was MÄtali, and I was Sakka.â

## Full Story
âNo king should.â
 
[4.116] {4.187}
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling in Jetavana, about CiÃ±camÄá¹avikÄ. 
Who falsely accused the Buddha of incontinence.


When the One with Ten Powers first attained supreme wisdom, after disciples had multiplied, and innumerable gods and men had been born into heavenly states, and the seeds of goodness had been cast abroad, great honour was shown him, and great gifts given. The heretics were like fireflies after sunrise; they had no honours and no gifts; in the street they stood, and cried out to the people, âWhat is the ascetic Gotama the Buddha? We are Buddhas also! Does that gift only bring great fruit, which is given to him? That which is given to us also has great fruit for you! Give to us also, work for us!â But cry as they would, they got no honour nor gifts. Then they came together in secret, and consulted, âHow can we cast a stain upon Gotama the ascetic in the face of men, and put an end to his honour and his gifts?â


Now there was at that time in SÄvatthi a certain nun, named CiÃ±camÄá¹avikÄ; she was very lovely, full of all grace, like a DevaccharÄ; rays of brilliancy shone forth from her body. Some one uttered a counsel of cruelty thus, âBy the help of CiÃ±camÄá¹avikÄ we will cast a stain upon the ascetic Gotama, and put an end to his honour and the gifts he receives.â âYes,â they all agreed, âthat is the way to do it.â


She came to the monastery of the heretics, and greeted them, and stood still. The heretics said nothing to her. She said: âWhat blemish is there in me? Three times I have greeted you!â She said again, âSirs, what blemish is in me? Why do you not speak to me?â They replied, âKnow you not, sister, that Gotama the ascetic is going about and doing us harm, cutting off all the honour and liberality that was shown us?â âI did not know it, sirs; but what can I do?â âIf you wish us well, sister by your own doing bring a stain upon the ascetic Gotama, and put an end to his honour and the gifts he receives.â She replied, âVery good, sirs, leave that to me; do not trouble about it.â With these words she departed.


After that, she used all a womanâs skill in deceit. When the people of SÄvatthi had heard the Dhamma, and were coming away from Jetavana, she used to go towards Jetavana, clad in a robe dyed with cochineal, and with fragrant garlands in her hands. 
{4.188}
 When any one asked her, âWhither away at this hour?â she would reply, âWhat have you to do with my goings and comings?â She spent the night in the hereticsâ monastery, which was close by Jetavana; and when early in the morning, the lay associates of the order came forth from the city to pay their morning salutation, she would meet them as though she had spent the night in Jetavana, going towards the city. If any one asked where she had stayed, she would answer, âWhat are my stayings and lodgings to you?â But after some six weeks, she replied, âI spent the night in Jetavana, with Gotama the ascetic, in one fragrant cell.â Then the unconverted began to wonder, could this be true, or not.


After three or four months, she bound bandages about her belly, and made it appear as though she were with child, and wrapped a red robe around her. Then she declared that she was with child by the ascetic Gotama, and made blind fools believe. After eight or nine months, she fastened about her pieces of wood in a bundle, and over all her 
[4.117]
 red robe; hands, feet, and back she caused to be beaten with the jawbone of an ox, so as to produce swellings; and made as though all her senses were wearied.


One evening, when the TathÄgata was sitting on the splendid seat of preaching, and was preaching the Dhamma, she went among the Saá¹gha, and standing in front of the TathÄgata, said: âO great ascetic! You preach indeed to great multitudes; sweet is your voice, and soft is the lip that covers your teeth; but you have got me with child, and my time is near; yet you assign me no chamber for the childbirth, you give me no ghee nor oil; what you will not do yourself, you do not ask another of the lay associates to do, the king of Kosala, or AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika, or VisÄkhÄ the great lay sister. Why do you not tell one of them to do what is to be done for me? You know how to take your pleasure, but you do not know how to care for that which shall be born!â So she reviled the TathÄgata in the midst of the Saá¹gha, as one might try to besmirch the moonâs face with a handful of filth. The TathÄgata stopped his discourse, and roaring like a lion in clarion tones, he said: âSister, whether that which you have said be true or false, you know and I only know.â âYes, truly,â said she, âthis happened through something that you and I only know of.â


Just at that moment, Sakkaâs throne became hot. Reflecting, he perceived the reason, âCiÃ±camÄá¹avikÄ is accusing the TathÄgata of what is not true.â Determined to clear up this matter, he came there with four Devaputtas in his company. The Devaputtas took on them the shape of mice, 
{4.189}
 and all at once gnawed through the cords that bound the bundle of wood: a wind-puff blew up the robe she wore, and the bundle of wood was disclosed and fell at her feet: the toes of both her feet were cut off. 
That this is the meaning is clear from the passive in the Dhp version, 
chijjiá¹su,
 p. 340.
 The people cried out, âA wretch is accusing the Supreme Buddha!â They spat on her head, and drove her forth from Jetavana with staves and clods in their hands. And as she passed beyond the range of the TathÄgataâs vision, the great earth yawned and showed a huge cleft, flames came up from the lowest hell, and she, enveloped in it as it were with a garment 
The meaning of this phrase is doubtful: in vol. ii. pp. 28 and 120, it is rendered âroyal woollen garmentâ: it may mean âwedding-garmentâ given to the bride by the bridegroomâs friends (Griersonâs 
Bihar Peasant Life,
 Â§ 1322).
 which her friends should wrap about her, fell to the lowest hell and there was born again. The honour and receipts of the other heretics ceased, those of the One with Ten Powers grew more abundantly.


Next day they were conversing in the Dhamma Hall, âMonks, CiÃ±camÄá¹avikÄ falsely accused the Supreme Buddha, great in virtue, worthy of all gifts! And she came to dire destruction.â The Teacher entered, and asked what they talked of, sitting there together. They told him. Said he, âNot only now, monks, has this woman falsely accused me, and come to dire destruction, but it was the same before.â So saying, he told a story of the past.

1. âNo king should punish an offence, and hear no pleas at all,

Not throughly sifting it himself in all points, great and small. 
These lines occur in Dhp-a XIII.9.


2. The warrior chief who punishes a fault before he tries,

Is like a man born blind, who eats his food all bones and flies.


3. Who punishes the guiltless, and lets go the guilty, knows

No more than one who blind upon a rugged highway goes. 
[4.120]


4. He who all this examines well, in things both great and small,

And so administers, deserves to be the head of all.


5. He that would set himself on high must not all-gentle be

Nor all-severe: but both these things practise in company.


6. Contempt the all-gentle wins, and he thatâs all-severe, has wrath:

So of the pair be well aware, and keep a middle path.


7. Much can the angry man, O king, and much the cheat can say:

And therefore for a womanâs sake your son you must not slay.â 
{4.193}

8. âOne side the whole world stands, my queen on the other all alone;

Yet her I cleave to: cast him down the cliff, and get you gone!â

9. âAs into hell-mouth, you were cast over a beetling hill,

No succour â many palm trees deep: how are you living still?â

10. âA serpent mighty, full of force, born on that mountain land,

Caught me within his coils; and so here safe from death I stand.â


11. âLo! I will take you back, O prince, to my own home again:

And there â what is the wood to you? With blessing you shall reign.â


12. âAs who a hook has swallowed down, and draws it forth all blood,

Drawn forth, is happy: so I see in me this bliss and good.â


13. âWhy speak you thus about a hook, why speak you thus of gore,

Why speak about the drawing out? Come tell me, I implore.â


14. âLust is the hook: fine elephants and horse by blood I show;

These by renouncing I have drawn; this, chieftain, you must know.â 
{4.196}

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he said: âThus, monks, this woman maligned me in days of yore, and came to dire destruction,â and then identified the JÄtaka by repeating the last verse:

âLady CiÃ±cÄ was my mother,

Devadatta was my father,


I was then the prince their son:

SÄriputta was the spirit,


And the good snake, I declare it,

Was Änanda. I have done.â

## Full Story
âHow should the wise.â
 
[4.122]
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling in Jetavana, about an upright courtier of the king of Kosala.


This man, they say, was most useful to the king, and then the king bestowed on him great honour. The other courtiers being unable to stomach him, accused him to the king of having done things to the kingâs hurt. The king made enquiry about him, and finding in him no fault, thought: âI see no fault in the man; how can I know whether he be my friend or foe?â Then he thought: âNo one, save the TathÄgata, 
{4.197}
 will be able to decide this question; I will go and ask him.â So after he had broken his fast he visited the Teacher, and said: âHow can one tell, sir, of any man, whether he be friend or foe?â Then the Teacher replied, âWise men of old, O king, have pondered this problem, and have questioned the wise about it, and following their advice, have discovered the truth, and renouncing their enemies have paid attention to their friends.â This said, at his request, he told a story of the past.

1. âHow should the wise and prudent strive, how may discernment know,

What deeds declare to eye or ear the man that is a foe?â

2. âHe smiles not when you see him, no welcome will he show,

He will not turn his eyes that way, and answers you with âNoâ. 
This couplet has occurred already in vol. ii. p. 92, of the translation.


3. Your enemies he honours, he cares not for your friends,

Those who would praise your worth, he stays, your slanderers commends.


4. No secret tells he to you, your secret he betrays,

Speaks never well of what you do, your wisdom will not praise.


5. He joys not at your welfare, but at your evil fame:

Should he receive some dainty, he thinks not of your name,

Nor pities you, nor cries aloud â âO, had my friend the same!â


6. These are the sixteen tokens by which a foe you see

These if a wise man sees or hears he knows his enemy. 
This also occurs above, vol. ii. p. 92, of this translation (two words differ).
 
{4.198}

How should the wise and prudent strive, what will discernment lend,

What deeds declare to eye and ear the man that is a friend?â 
[4.123]

7. âThe absent he remembers; returned, he will rejoice:

Then in the height of his delight he greets you with his voice.


8. Your foes he never honours, he loves to serve your friends,

Those who would slander you, he stays; who praise you, he commends.


9. He tells his secrets to you, your secret neâer betrays,

Speaks ever well of all you do, your wisdom loves to praise.


10. He joys to hear your welfare, not in your evil fame:

Should he receive some dainty, he straight thinks on your name,

And pities you, and cries aloud â âO had my friend the same!â


11. These are the sixteen tokens in friends established well,

Which if a wise man sees or hears he can a true friend tell.â 
{4.199}

The Teacher, having ended this discourse, said: âThus, great king, this question arose in days of yore, even as now, and wise men said their say; by these two-and-thirty signs may friend or foe be known.â With those words, he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time, Änanda was the king, and I myself was the wise courtier.â

## Full Story
âYoung student, when.â
 
[4.124] {4.200}
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling in Jetavana, about Devadatta. Devadatta repudiated his teacher, saying: âI will be Buddha myself, and Gotama the ascetic is no teacher or preceptor of mine!â So, aroused from his Absorption, he made a breach in the Saá¹gha. Then step by step he proceeded to SÄvatthi, and outside Jetavana, the earth yawned, and he went down into the hell AvÄ«ci.


Then they were all talking of it in the Dhamma Hall, âMonk, Devadatta deserted his Teacher, and came to dire destruction, being born to another life in the deep hell AvÄ«ci!â The Teacher, entering, asked what they spoke of, and they told him. Said he, âNot only now, but in former days, as now, Devadatta deserted his teacher, and came to dire destruction.â So saying, he told a story of the past.

1. âYoung student, when I asked it you of late,

You brought me mango fruit both small and great:

Now no fruit, brahmin, on the tree appears,

Though the same charm you still reiterate!â 
[4.127]

2. âThe hour and moment suit not: so wait I

Fit junction of the planets in the sky. 
{4.204}

The due conjunction and the moment come,

Then will I bring you mangoes plenteously.â

3. âYou said no word of times and seasons, nor

Of planetary junctions heretofore:

But mangoes, fragrant, delicate in taste,

Of colour fine, you brought in plenteous store.


4. Previously, brahmin, you produced well

Fruit on the tree by muttering of your spell:

Today you cannot, mutter as you may.

What means this conduct, I would have you tell?â

5. âA low-caste man my teacher was, who taught

Duly and well the charm, and how it wrought:

Saying, âIf you are asked my name and birth,

Hide nothing, or the charm will come to nought.â


6. Asked by the Lord of Men, though well I knew,

Yet in deceit I said what was not true;

âA brahminâs spells,â I lying said; and now,

Charm lost, my folly bitterly I rue.â 
{4.205}

7. âNimb, castor oil, or plassey tree, 
Butea Frondosa. As Plassey was named from this tree, it is perhaps admissible as a name of the tree.
 whatever be the tree

Where he who seeks finds honeycombs, âtis best of trees, thinks he.


8. Be it Khattiya, brahmin, Vessa, he from whom a man learns right â

Sudda, Caá¹á¸Äla, Pukkusa â seems chief in his sight. 
These are the names of six castes: Ká¹£atriya, BrÄhmaá¹a, VaiÅya, ÅÅ«dra, the four castes familiar in Sanskrit books, together with two Caá¹á¸Äla and PukkaÅa, both mixed castes and much despised. More about these castes, and the Buddhist system as contrasted with the brahminical, may be seen in R. Fickâs 
Sociale Gliederung im NordÃ¶stlichen
 [128]
 
Indien zu Buddhaâs Zeit,
 Kiel, 1897. Fick denies that the Suddas were ever a real caste (p. 202). For 
Caá¹á¸Äla,
 see p. 203; for 
Pukkusa,
 p. 206; both, in his opinion, non-Aryan subject races, serfs almost. The order of the list in our verse should be noticed. The 
JÄtaka
 gives the Khattiyas, or Warriors, precedence over the brahmins.
 
[4.128]


9. Punish the worthless churl, or even slay,

Hence take him by the throat without delay,

Who having gained a treasure with great toil,

Throws it with overweening pride away!â

10. âOft he who thinks the level ground is lying at his foot,

Falls in a pool, pit, precipice, trips on a rotten root;

Another treads what seems a cord, a jet-black snake to find;

Another steps into the fire because his eyes are blind:

I have done wrong, and lost my spell; but you, O teacher wise,

Forgive! And let me once again find favour in your eyes!â

11. âTo you in right due manner I did tell,

You in due manner rightly learned the spell,

Full willingly its nature I explained:

Neâer had it left you, had you acted well. 
{4.207}


12. Who with much toil, O fool! Hath learned a spell

Full hard for those who now in this world dwell,

Then, foolish one! A living gained at last,

Throws all away, because he lies will tell,


13. To such a fool, unwise, of lying fain,

Ungrateful, who can not himself restrain â

Spells, indeed! Mighty spells we give not him:

Go hence away, and ask me not again!â 
[4.129]

The Teacher having made an end of this discourse, said: âNot only now, monk, has Devadatta denied his teacher, and come to dire destruction,â and so saying, he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time Devadatta was the ungrateful man, Änanda was the king, and I was the low caste man.â

âO man, who stand.â
 This story the Teacher told on the bank of the river Rohiá¹Ä«, about a family quarrel. The circumstances will be described at large under the Kuá¹ÄlajÄtaka [Ja 536].

This was a story told by the Teacher, while dwelling beside lake Kuá¹Äla, concerning five hundred monks who were overwhelmed with discontent. Here follows the story in due order. The SÄkiya and Koliya tribes had the river RohinÄ« which flows between the cities of Kapilavatthu and Koliya confined by a single dam and by means of it cultivated their crops. In the month Jeá¹­á¹­hamÅ«la when the crops began to flag and droop, the labourers from amongst the dwellers of both cities assembled together. Then the people of Koliya said: âShould this water be drawn off on both sides, it will not prove sufficient for both us and you. But our crops will thrive with a single watering; give us then the water.â The people of Kapilavatthu said: âWhen you have filled your garners with corn, we shall hardly have the courage to come with ruddy gold, emeralds and copper coins, and with baskets and sacks in our hands, to hang about your doors. Our crops too will thrive with a single watering; give us the water.â âWe will not give it,â they said. âNeither will we,â said the others.


As words thus ran high, one of them rose up and struck another a blow, and he in turn struck a third and thus it was that what with interchanging of blows and spitefully touching on the origin of their princely families they increased the tumult. The Koliya labourers said: âBe off with your people of Kapilavatthu, men who like dogs, jackals, and such like beasts, cohabited with their own sisters. What will their elephants and horses, their shields and spears avail against us?â The SÄkiya labourers replied, âNay, do you, wretched lepers, be off with your children, destitute and ill-conditioned fellows, who like brute beasts had their dwelling in a hollow jujube tree (koli). What shall their elephants and horses, their spears and shields avail against us?â


So they went and told the councillors appointed to such services and they reported it to the princes of their tribes. Then the SÄkiyas said: âWe will show them how strong and mighty are the men who cohabited with their sisters,â and they sallied forth, ready for the fray. And the Koliyas said: âWe will show them how strong and mighty are they who dwelt in the hollow of a jujube tree,â and they too sallied forth ready for the fight.


But other teachers tell the story thus, âWhen the female slaves of the SÄkiyas and Koliyas came to the river to fetch water, and throwing the coils of cloth that they carried on their heads upon the ground were seated and pleasantly conversing, a certain woman took anotherâs cloth, thinking it was her own; and when owing to this a quarrel arose, each claiming the coil of cloth as hers, gradually the people of the two cities, the serfs and the labourers, the attendants, headmen, councillors and viceroys, all of them sallied forth ready for battle.â But the former version being found in many commentaries and being plausible is to be accepted rather than this one.


Now it was at eventide that they would be sallying forth, ready for the fray. At that time the Fortunate One was dwelling at SÄvatthi, and at dawn of day while contemplating the world he beheld them setting out to the fight, and on seeing them he wondered whether if he were to go there the quarrel would cease, and he made up his mind and thought: âI will go there and, to quell this feud, I will relate three JÄtaka Stories, and after that the quarrelling will cease. Then after telling two JÄtaka Stories, to illustrate the blessings of union, I will teach them the Attadaá¹á¸asutta [Snp 4.15] and after hearing my sermon the people of the two cities will each of them bring into my presence two hundred and fifty youths, and I shall admit them to the Saá¹gha and there will be a huge gathering.â


Thus after performing his toilet, he went his rounds in SÄvatthi for alms, and on his return, after taking his meal, at eventide he issued forth from his Perfumed Chamber and without saying a word to any man he took his bowl and robe and went by himself and sat cross-legged in the air between the two hosts. And seeing it was an occasion to startle them, to create darkness he sat there emitting (dark-blue) rays from his hair. Then when their hearts were troubled he revealed himself and emitted the six-coloured rays.


The people of Kapilavatthu on seeing the Fortunate One thought: âThe Teacher, our noble kinsman, is come. Can he have seen the obligation laid upon us to fight?â âNow that the Teacher has come, it is impossible for us to discharge a weapon against the person of an enemy,â and they threw down their arms, saying: âLet the Koliyas slay us or roast us alive.â The Koliyas acted in exactly the same way. Then the Fortunate One alighted and seated himself on a magnificent Buddha throne, set in a charming spot on a bed of sand, and he shone with the incomparable glory of a Buddha. The kings too saluting the Fortunate One took their seats.


Then the Teacher, though he knew it right well, asked, âWhy are you come here, mighty kings?â âVenerable sir,â they answered, âwe are come, neither to see this river, nor to disport ourselves, but to get up a fight.â âWhat is the quarrel about, sires?â âAbout the water.â âWhat is the water worth?â âVery little, venerable sir.â âWhat is the earth worth?â âIt is of priceless value.â âWhat are warrior chiefs worth?â âThey too are of priceless value.â âWhy on account of some worthless water are you for destroying chiefs of high worth? Verily, there is no satisfaction in this quarrel, but owing to a feud, sire, between a certain Tree DevatÄ and a black lion a grudge was set up, which has reached down to this present aeon,â and with these words he told them the PhandanajÄtaka [Ja 475].

On this occasion the Teacher addressed himself to the kinsmen, O king, and said.

1. âO man, who stand with axe in hand, within this woodland haunt,

Come tell me true, I ask of you, what tree is it you want?â

2. âUp hill, down dale, along the plain, a king you range the wood:

Come tell me true, I ask of you â what tree for wheels is good?â

3. âNot SÄl, acacia, not mareâs-ear, 
Vatica Robusta: so called from the shape of its leaves.
 much less a shrub 
dhavo:
 Grislea Tomentosa.
 is good;

There is a tree they call plassey, and thereâs your best wheel-wood.â

4. âWhat is the fashion of the leaves, what sort the trunk to see,

Come tell me true, I ask of you, that I may know that tree?â

5. âThis is the tree whose branch you see droop, bend, but never break;

This is the plassey, on whose roots my standing-place I take.


6. For spoke or felloe, pole of car, or wheel, or any part,

This plassey tree will do for you in making of a cart.â

7. âThus did at once the plassey tree his will and wish make clear:

I too a message have to tell: O BhÄradvÄja, hear!


8. âFrom shoulder of the king of beasts cut off four inches wide,

And put it round the wheel, for so more strong it will abide.â


9. So in a trice the plassey tree, indulging in his ire,

On lions born and those unborn brought down destruction dire.â

10. âThus plassey tree contends with beast, 
The word is 
Ä«so,
 âlord,â i.e. lion, king of beasts. So above.
 and beast with tree contends,

So each with mutual dispute to death the other sends.


11. So among men, whereâer a feud or quarrel does arise,

They, as the beast and tree did now, cut capers peacock-wise. 
The commentator explains that men expose themselves in a quarrel, as peacocks expose their privy parts. This is perhaps an allusion to No. 32.


12. This tell I you, that well is you what time you are at one:

Be of one mind, and quarrel not, as beast and tree have done. 
[4.132]


13. Learn peace with all men; this the wise all praise; and who is fain

Of peace and righteousness, he sure will final peace attain.â

The Teacher, having brought this discourse to an end, identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time, I was the deity who lived in that wood, and saw the whole business.â

## Analysis
In the present the Buddha teaches about the quickness of the decay of lifeâs elements. Then he tells a story of a goose who was swifter than the sun, and when asked if anything was swifter than he, taught Dhamma to the king, thereby converting him.


The Bodhisatta = the quick goose (javanahaá¹sa),

Änanda = the king (of Benares) (rÄjÄ),

SÄriputta = the middle (goose) (majjhima),

MoggallÄna = the youngest (goose) (kaniá¹­á¹­ha),

the Buddhaâs disciples = the other geese (sesahaá¹sagaá¹Ä).

## Full Story
âCome, goose.â
 This story the Teacher told at Jetavana about the Daá¸·hadhammasuttanta or the Parable of the Strong Men. 
[This refers to SN 20.6, 
Dhanuggahasutta
.]
 The Fortunate One said: âSuppose, monks, four archers to stand at the four points of the compass, strong men, well trained and of great skill, perfect in archery and then let a man come and say, âIf these four archers, strong, well trained, and of great skill, perfect in archery 
{4.212}
 shoot forth arrows from four points, I will catch those arrows as they are shot, and before they touch the ground,â would you not agree, sure enough, that he must be a very swift man and the perfection of swiftness? Well, monks, great as the swiftness of such a man might be, great as the swiftness of sun and moon, there is something swifter: great, I say, monks, as the swiftness of such a man might be, great as the swiftness of the sun and moon, and though the gods outfly sun or moon in swiftness, there is something swifter than the gods: great, monks, as the swiftness of that man (and so forth), yet more swiftly than the gods can go, the elements which make up life do decay. Therefore, monks, this you must learn, to be careful; verily I say unto you, this you must learn.â


Two days after this teaching, they were talking about it in the Dhamma Hall, âMonks, the Teacher in his own peculiar province as Buddha, illustrating the nature of what makes up life, showed it to be transient and weak, and smote with extreme terror monks and unconverted alike. Oh, the might of a Buddha!â The Teacher entered and asked what they talked of. They told him; and he said: âIt is no marvel, monks, if I in my omniscience alarm the monks by my teaching, and show how transient are lifeâs elements. Even I, when without natural cause 
A mode of coming into existence all of a sudden, without the natural processes.
 I was conceived by a goose, showed forth the transient nature of the elements of life, and by my teaching alarmed the whole court of a king, together with the king of Benares himself.â So saying, he told a story of the past.

1. âCome, noble goose, come sit you here; dear is your sight to me;

Now you are master of the place; choose anything you see.â

2. âBy hearing of the loved one love is fed,

By sight the craving for the lost falls dead:

Since sight and hearing makes men lief and dear,

With sight of you let me be favourÃ©d.


3. Dear is your voice, and dearer far your presence when I see:

Then since I love the sight of you, O Goose, come dwell with me!â

4. âEver would I dwell with you, in the honour thus conferred;

But you might say in wine one day: âBroil me that royal bird!â â 
{4.217}

5. âAccursed be both food and drink I should love more than you;

And I will taste no drop nor sup while you shall stay with me!â

6. âThe cry of jackals or of birds is understood with ease;

Yea, but the word of men, O king, is darker far than these!


7. A man may think, this is my friend, my comrade, of my kin,

But friendship goes, and often hate and enmity begin. 
These two couplets occur again in No. 478 (p. 141).
 
[4.136]


8. Who has your heart, is near to you, with you, whereâer he be;

But who dwells with you, and your heart estranged, afar is he.


9. Who in your house of kindly heart shall be

Is kindly still though far across the sea:

Who in your house shall hostile be of heart,

Hostile he is though ocean-wide apart.


10. Your foes, O lord of chariots! Though near you, are afar:

But, fosterer of your realm! The good in heart closely linked are.


11. Who stay too long, find oftentimes that friend is changed to foe;

Then ere I lose your friendship, I will take my leave, and go.â 
{4.218}

12. âThough I with folded hands beseech, you will not give me ear;

You spare no word for us, to whom your service would be dear

I crave one favour: come again and pay a visit here.â

13. âIf nothing comes to snap our life, O king! If you and I

Still live, O fosterer of your folk! Perhaps Iâll hither fly,

And we may see each other yet, as days and nights go by.â

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he said: âThus, monks, long ago, even when I was born as one of the animals, I showed the frailty of all lifeâs elements, and declared the Dhamma.â So saying, he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time Änanda was the king, MoggallÄna was the youngest bird, SÄriputta was the second, the Buddhaâs followers were all geese of the flock, and I myself was the swift goose.â

## Full Story
âNo wood is chopped.â
 
{4.219}
 This story the Teacher told, while dwelling at Jetavana, about the allurements of a sensual girl.


There was then, we learn, a girl of about sixteen, daughter of a citizen of SÄvatthi, such as might bring good luck to a man, yet no man chose her. So her mother thought to herself, âThis my daughter is of full age, yet no one chooses her. I will use her as bait for a fish, and make one of those SÄkiyan ascetics come back to the world, and live upon him.â


At the time there was a young man of good birth living in SÄvatthi, who had given his heart to the dispensation and went forth. But from the time when he had received full ordination he had lost all desire for learning, and lived devoted to the adornment of his 
[4.137]
 person.


The lay sister used to prepare in her house rice gruel, and other food hard or soft, and standing at the door, as the monks walked along the streets, looked out for someone who could be tempted by the craving for delicacies. Streaming by went a crowd of monks who upheld the Three Baskets, including the Abhidhamma and the Vinaya; but among them she saw none ready to rise to her bait. Among the figures with bowl and robe, preachers of the Dhamma with honey-sweet voice, moving like fleecy scud before the wind, she saw not one.


But at last she perceived a man approaching, the outer corners of his eyes anointed, hair hanging down, wearing an under-robe of fine cloth, and an outer robe shaken and cleansed, bearing a bowl coloured like some precious gem, and a sunshade after his own heart, a man who let his senses have their own way, his body much bronzed. âHere is a man I can catch!â thought she; and greeting him, she took his bowl, and invited him into the house. She found him a seat, and provided rice gruel and all the rest; then after the meal, begged him to make that house his resort in future. So he used to visit the house after that, and in course of time became intimate.


One day, the lay sister said in his hearing, âIn this household we are happy enough, only I have no son or son-in-law capable of keeping it up.â The man heard it, and wondering what reason she could have for so saying, in a little while he was as it were pierced to the heart. She said to her daughter, âTempt this man, and get him into your power.â So the girl after that time decked herself and adorned herself, and tempted him with all womenâs tricks and wiles. 
{4.220}
 (You must understand that a âfatâ girl does not mean one whose body is fat, 
[This explanation doesnât make much sense in English, but a fat (
thulla
) girl in PÄá¸·i, meant one who was mature but unmarried.]
 but be she fat or be she thin, by power of the five sensual passions she is called âfatâ.) Then the man, being young and under the power of passion, thought in his heart, âI cannot now hold on to the Buddhaâs dispensation,â and he went to the monastery, and laying down bowl and robe, said to his spiritual teachers, âI am discontented.â


Then they conducted him to the Teacher, and said: âSir, this monk is discontented.â âIs this true which they say,â asked he, âthat you are discontented, monk?â âYes, sir, true it is.â âThen what made you so?â âA sensual girl, sir.â âMonk,â said he, âlong, long ago, when you were living in the forest, this same girl was a hindrance to your holiness, and did you great harm; then why are you again discontented on her account?â Then at the request of the monks he told a story of the past.

1. âNo wood is chopped, and you have brought no water from the pool,

No fire is kindled: why do you lie mooning like a fool?â

2. âI cannot live in forests: this, O Kassapa, I swear;

Hard is the woodland life, and back to men 
Literally âthe kingdom.â
 I would repair.


3. Teach me, O brahmin, when I leave, that wheresoeâer I go,

The customs of the countryside I may most fully know.â 
{4.222}

4. âIf âtis your mind to leave behind the woodland fruits and roots

And dwell in cities, hear me teach the way which that life suits:


5. Keep clear of every precipice, from poison keep afar,

Sit never in the mud, and walk with care where serpents are.â
 [4.139]

6. âWhat has your precipice to do with the ascetic way,

Your mud, your poison, and your snake? Come tell me this, I pray.â

7. âThere is a liquor in the world, my son, that men call wine,

Fragrant, delicious, honey-sweet, and cheap, of flavour fine:

This, NÄrada, for holy men is poison, say the wise.


8. And women in the world can set foolsâ wits a whirling round,

They catch young hearts, as hurricanes catch cotton from the ground:

The precipice I mean is this before the good man lies.


9. High honours shown by other men, respect and fame and gain,

This is the mud, O NÄrada, which holy men may stain.


10. Great monarchs with their retinue have in that world dwelling,

And they are great, O NÄrada, and each a mighty king: 
{4.223}


11. Before the feet of sovereign lords and monarchs walk not you,

For, NÄrada, these are the snakes of whom I spake just now.


12. The house you come to for your food, when men sit down to meat,

If you see good within that house, there take your fill, and eat.


13. When by another entertained with food or drink, this do:

Eat not too much, nor drink too much, and fleshly sensual desires eschew.


14. From gossip, drink, lewd company, and shops of goldsmithâs ware,

Keep you afar as those who by the uneven pathway fare.â

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time this sensual girl was the young woman, the discontented monk was the asceticâs son, and I was the father.â

âKing KÄliá¹ga.â
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana about worship of the Bodhi tree performed by elder Änanda.


When the TathÄgata had set forth on pilgrimage, for the purpose of gathering in those who were ripe for conversion, the citizens of SÄvatthi proceeded to Jetavana, their hands full of garlands and fragrant wreaths, and finding no other place to show their reverence, laid them by the gateway of the perfumed chamber and went off. This caused great rejoicings. But AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika got to hear of it; and on the return of the TathÄgata visited elder Änanda and said to him, âThis monastery, sir, is left unprovided while the TathÄgata goes on pilgrimage, and there is no place for the people to do reverence by offering fragrant wreaths and garlands. Will you be so kind, sir, as to tell the TathÄgata of this matter, and learn from him whether or not it is possible to find a place for this purpose.â The other, quite willingly, did so, asking, âHow many shrines are there?â âThree, Änanda.â âWhich are they?â âShrines for a relic of the body, a relic of use or wear, a relic of memorial.â 
The last class is said to be images of the Buddha.
 âCan a shrine be made, sir, during your life?â âNo, Änanda, not a body-shrine; that kind is made when a Buddha enters NibbÄna. A shrine of memorial is improper because the connection depends on the imagination only. But the great Bodhi tree used by the Buddhas is fit for a shrine, be they alive or be they dead.â âSir, while you are away on pilgrimage the great monastery of Jetavana 
[4.143]
 is unprotected, and the people have no place where they can show their reverence. Shall I plant a seed of the great Bodhi tree before the gateway of Jetavana?â âBy all means so do, Änanda, and that shall be as it were an abiding place for me.â


The elder told this to AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika, and VisÄkhÄ, and the king. Then at the gateway of Jetavana he cleared out a pit for the Bodhi tree to stand in, and said to the chief elder, MoggallÄna, âI want to plant a Bodhi tree in front of Jetavana. Will you get me a fruit of the great Bodhi tree?â The elder, willingly, passed through the air to the platform under the Bodhi tree. 
{4.229}
 He placed in his robe a fruit that was dropping 
Reading 
parigalantaá¹
.
 from its stalk but had not reached the ground, brought it back, and delivered it to Änanda. The elder informed the king of Kosala that he was to plant the Bodhi tree that day. So in the evening time the king came with a great concourse, bringing all things necessary; then also AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika and VisÄkhÄ came and a crowd of the faithful besides.


In the place where the Bodhi tree was to be planted the elder had placed a golden jar, and in the bottom of it was a hole; all was filled with earth moistened with fragrant water. He said: âO king, plant this seed of the Bodhi tree,â giving it to the king. But the king, thinking that his kingdom was not to be in his hands for ever, and that AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika ought to plant it, passed the seed to AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika, the great merchant. Then AnÄthapiá¹á¸ika stirred up the fragrant soil and dropped it in. The instant it dropped from his hand, before the very eyes of all, it sprang up as broad as a plough-head a Bodhi sapling, fifty cubits tall; on the four sides and upwards shot forth five great branches of fifty cubits in length, like the trunk. So stood the tree, a very lord of the forest already; a mighty miracle! The king poured round the tree jars of gold and of silver, in number eight hundred, filled with scented water, beauteous with a great quantity of blue water-lilies, and caused to be set there a long line of vessels all full, and a seat he had made of the seven precious things, golden dust he had sprinkled about it, a wall was built round the precincts, he erected a gate chamber of the seven precious things. Great was the honour paid to it.


The elder, approaching the TathÄgata, said to him, âSir, for the peopleâs good, accomplish under the Bodhi tree which I have planted that height of Attainment to which you attained under the great Bodhi tree.â âWhat is this you say, Änanda?â replied he. âThere is no other place can support me, if I sit there and attain to that which I attained in the enclosure of the great Bodhi tree.â âSir,â said Änanda, âI pray you for the good of the people, to use this tree for the rapture of Attainment, in so far as this spot of ground can support the weight.â The Teacher used it during one night for the rapture of Attainment.


The elder informed the king, and all the rest, and called it by the name of the Bodhi Festival. And this tree, having been planted by Änanda, was known by the name of Änandaâs Bodhi tree. 
[In the story AnÄthapiá¹á¸aka does the actual planting, monks not being allowed to dig the earth. We may understand it as being due to Änanda that the tree was planted.]


At that time they began to talk of it in the Dhamma Hall. âMonks, while yet the TathÄgata lived, the venerable Änanda caused a Bodhi tree to be planted, 
{4.230}
 and great reverence to be paid to it. Oh, how great is the elderâs power!â The Teacher entered and asked what they were talking of. They told him. He said: âThis is not the first time, monks, that Änanda led captive mankind in the four great continents, with all the surrounding throngs, and caused a vast quantity of scented wreaths to be brought, and made a Bodhi Festival in the precinct of the great Bodhi tree.â So saying, he told a story of the past.

1. âKing KÄliá¹ga, lord supreme,

Ruled the earth by law and right,

To the Bodhi tree once he came

On an elephant of might.â

2. âThis KÄliá¹gabhÄradvÄja told his king, the asceticâs son,

As he rolled the Wheel Jewel, guiding him, obeisance done:


3. This the place the poets sing of; here, O mighty king, alight!

Here attained to Awakening perfect Buddhas, shining bright.


4. In the world, tradition has it, this one spot is hallowed ground,

Where in attitude of reverence herbs and creepers stand around. 
The commentator says of this 
maá¹á¸o:
 âAs the age continues, at first it continues the same, then with the waning of the age wanes again and grows less.â


5. Come, descend and do obeisance; since as far as the ocean bound

In the fertile earth all-fostering this one spot is hallowed ground. 
[4.147]


6. All the elephants you ownest thoroughbred by dam and sire,

Hither drive them, they will surely come thus far, but come no nigher.


7. He is thoroughbred you ride on; drive the creature as you will,

He can go not one step further: here the elephant stands still.


8. Spake the soothsayer, heard KÄliá¹ga; then the king to him, said he,

Driving deep the goad into him: âBe this truth, we soon shall see.â


9. Pierced, the creature trumpets loudly, shrill as any heron cries,

Moved, then fell upon his haunches neath the weight, and could not rise.â 
{4.234}

10. âWhen KÄliá¹gabhÄradvÄja saw the elephant was dead,

He in fear and trepidation then to king KÄliá¹ga said:

Seek another, mighty monarch: this your elephant is dead.â 
{4.235}

11. âThis heard, KÄliá¹ga in dismay

Mounted another, and straightway

Upon the earth the corpse sank down,

And the soothsayerâs word for very truth was shown.â

12. âTo KÄliá¹gabhÄradvÄja king KÄliá¹ga thus did say:

All you know and you understand, and you see all alway.â

13. âBut the brahmin straight denied it, and thus spake unto the king:

I know truth of marks and tokens: but the Buddhas, every thing.


14. Though all-knowing and all-seeing, yet in marks they have no skill:

They know all, but know by insight: I a man of books am still.â

15. âThus worshipped he the Bodhi tree 
Reading 
taá¹ bodhiá¹
. [The original mistakenly writes 
tain bodhim
.]
 with much melodious sound

Of music, and with fragrant wreaths: a wall he set around,â

16. âBrought flowers in sixty thousand carts an offering to be;

Thus king KÄliá¹ga worshipped the circuit of the tree.â

The Teacher, having finished this discourse, said: âIt is not now the first time, monks, that Änanda did worship the Bodhi tree, but previously also,â and then he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time Änanda was KÄliá¹ga, and I myself was KÄliá¹gabhÄradvÄja.â

 This story the Teacher told while dwelling in Jetavana, about a generous donor who lived in SÄvatthi. This man, so it is said, invited the Teacher, and for seven days gave many gifts to the company which followed with him; on the last day he presented the company of the Ariya Saá¹gha with all things necessary for them. Then said the 
[4.149]
 Teacher, rendering thanks to him, âLay brother, great is your generosity: a thing most difficult you have done. This custom of giving is the custom of wise men of old. Gifts must be given, be you in the world, be you in retirement from the world; the wise men of old, even when they had left the world and dwelt in the woodland, when they had to eat but KÄra 
Canthium parviflorum.
 leaves sprinkled with water, without salt or spice, 
{4.237}
 yet gave to all beggars that passed by to serve their need, and themselves lived on their own joy and blessedness.â The man answered, âSir, this giving of all necessary things to the company is clear enough, but what you say is not clear. Will you not explain it to us?â Then the Teacher at his request told a story of the past.

1. âSakka, the lord of beings, saw Akitti honourÃ©d:

âWhy, O great brahmin, do you rest here in the heatâ? he said.â

2. âRebirth, the bodyâs breaking up, death, delusion is pain:

Therefore, O Sakka VÄsava! I here in peace remain.â

3. âFair spoken, Kassapa, well put, most excellently said:

Choose now a boon â as bids your heart, so let the choice be made.â 
This couplet has already been given: see p. 7, above.

4. âSakka, the lord of beings all, has offered me a boon,

I pray no lust for such as these may harbour in my breast.â

Come tell me why foolsâ company is more than you can bear?â

Ill-doing is his good, he is angry when spoken fair,

Knows not right conduct; this is why I would have no fool there.â

Why do you wish that where you are, the wise man should be there?â

Well-doing is his good, nor is he angry when spoken fair,

Knows well right conduct; this is why âtis well he should be there.â

May I be free from sensual desires, and when the sun begins to shine

May holy mendicants appear, and grant me food divine;


17. May this not dwindle as I give, nor I repent the deed,

But be my heart in giving glad: this choose I for my meed.â


18. âFair spoken, Kassapa, well put, most excellently said:

Choose now a boon â as bids your heart, so let the choice be made.â


19. âSakka, the lord of beings all, to me a boon he gave:

O Sakka, visit me no more: this boon is all I crave.â

Desire to see me: can there be a danger in the sight?â


21. âSuch is your aspect all divine, such glory and delight,

This seen, I may forget my vows: this danger has the sight.â

## Full Story
âI spoke.â
 
[4.153]
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling in Jetavana, about KokÄlika.


During one rainy season the two chief disciples, 
SÄriputta and MoggallÄna.
 desiring to leave the multitude and to dwell apart, took leave of the Teacher, and went into the kingdom where KokÄlika was. They repaired to the residence of KokÄlika, and said this to him, âMonk KokÄlika, 
{4.243}
 since for us it is delightful to dwell with you, and for you to dwell with us, we would abide here three months.â âHow,â said the other, âwill it be delightful for you to dwell with me?â They answered, âIf you tell not a soul that the two chief disciples are dwelling here, we shall be happy, and that will be our delight in dwelling with you.â âAnd how is it delightful for me to dwell with you?â âWe will teach the Dhamma to you for three months in your home, and we will discourse to you, and that will be your delight in dwelling with us.â âDwell here, monks,â said he, âso long as you will,â and he allotted a pleasant residence to them. There they dwelt in the fruition of the Attainments, and no man knew of their dwelling in that place.


When they had thus past the rains they said to him, âMonk, now we have dwelt with you, and we will go to visit the Teacher,â and asked his leave to go. He agreed, and went with them on the rounds for alms in a village over against the place where they were. After their meal the elders departed from the village. KokÄlika leaving them, turned back and said to the people, âLay brethren, you are like brute animals. Here the two chief disciples have been dwelling for three months in the monastery opposite, and you knew nothing of it: now they are gone.â âWhy did you not tell us, sir?â the people asked.


Then they took ghee and oil and medicines, raiment and clothes, and approached the elders, saluting them and saying: âPardon us, sirs we knew not you were the chief disciples, we have learned it but today by the words of the venerable monk KokÄlika. Pray have compassion on us, and receive these medicines and clothes.â KokÄlika went after the elders with them, for he thought: âThe elders are frugal, and content with little; they will not accept these things, and then they will be given to me.â But the elders, because the gift was offered at the instigation of a monk, neither accepted the things themselves nor had them given to KokÄlika. The lay folk then said: âSirs, if you will not accept these, come here once again to bless us.â The elders promised, and proceeded to the Teacherâs presence.


Now KokÄlika was angry, because the elders neither accepted those things themselves, nor had them given to him. The elders, however, having remained a short while with the Teacher, each chose five hundred monks as their following, and with these thousand monks went on pilgrimage seeking alms, as far as KokÄlikaâs country. The lay folk came out to meet them, and led them to the same monastery, and showed them great honour day by day. 
{4.244}


Great was the store given them of clothes and of medicines. Those monks who went out with the elders dividing the garments gave of them to all the monks which had come, but to KokÄlika gave none, neither did the elders give him any. Getting no clothes KokÄlika began to abuse and revile the 
[4.154]
 elders, âSÄriputta and MoggallÄna are full of wicked desire; they would not accept before what was offered them, but these things they do accept. There is no satisfying them, they have no regard for another.â But the elders, perceiving that the man was harbouring evil on their account, set out with their followers to depart; nor would they return, not though the people begged them to stay yet a few days longer.


Then a young monk said: âWhere shall the elders stay, laymen? Your own particular elder does not wish them to stay here.â Then the people went to KokÄlika, and said: âSir, we are told you do not wish the elders to stay here. Go to! Either appease them and bring them back, or away with you and live elsewhere!â In fear of the people this man went and made his request to the elders. âGo back, monk,â answered the elders, âwe will not return.â So he, being unable to prevail upon them, returned to the monastery. Then the lay brethren asked him whether the elders had returned. âI could not persuade them to return,â said he. âWhy not, monk?â they asked. And then they began to think it must be no good monks would dwell there because the man did wrong, and they must get rid of him. âSir,â they said, âdo not stay here; we have nothing here for you.â


Thus dishonoured by them, he took bowl and robe and went to Jetavana. After saluting the Teacher, he said: âSir, SÄriputta and MoggallÄna are full of wicked desire, they are in the power of wicked desires!â The Teacher replied, âSay not so, KokÄlika; let your heart, KokÄlika, have confidence in SÄriputta and MoggallÄna; learn that they are good monks.â KokÄlika said: âYou believe in your two chief disciples, sir; I have seen it with my own eyes; they have wicked desires, they have secrets within them, they are wicked men.â So he said thrice (though the Teacher would have stayed him), then rose from his seat, and departed. Even as he went on his way there arose over all his body boils of the size of a mustard seed, which grew and grew to the size of a ripe seed of the wood apple tree, 
Aegle Marmelos. [Indian bael, or belli tree.]
 burst, and blood ran all over him. Groaning he fell by the gate of Jetavana, maddened with pain.


A great cry arose, and reached even to the Brahma Realm, âKokÄlika has reviled the two chief disciples!â Then his spiritual teacher, the Brahma Tudu by name, 
{4.245}
 learning the fact, came with the intent of appeasing the elders, and said while poised in the air, âKokÄlika, a cruel thing this you have done; make your peace with the chief disciples.â âWho are you, brother?â the man asked. âTudu Brahma, is my name,â said he. âHave you not been declared by the Fortunate One,â said the man, âone of those who return not? 
AnÄgÄmi,
 those of the Third Path, who return not to be reborn on earth.
 That word means that such come not back to this earth. You will become a Yakkha upon a dunghill!â Thus he upbraided the MahÄbrahma. And as he could not persuade the man to do as he advised, he replied to him, âMay you be tormented according to your own word.â Then he returned to his abode of bliss. And KokÄlika after dying was born again in the Lotus Hell. 
Not in Hardyâs list of the chief Hells (
Manual,
 p. 26); but there were 136 of them. Burnouf gives it, 
Introductory

 That he had been born there the great and mighty Brahma Sahampati 
Sahampati;
 the meaning of the first part is unknown [it means master of SahÄ, his renowned wife]; he is the chief of the Brahma Heaven, of which Tudu is an angel.
 told to the TathÄgata, and the Teacher told it to the monks.


In the Dhamma Hall the monks talked of the manâs wickedness, âMonks, they say KokÄlika reviled SÄriputta and MoggallÄna, and by the words of his own mouth came to the Lotus Hell.â The Teacher came in, and said he, âWhat speak you of, monks, as you sit here?â They told him. Then he said: âThis is not the first time, monks, that KokÄlika was destroyed by his own word, and out of his own mouth was condemned to misery; it was the same before.â And he told them a story.
 [4.155]

1. âI spoke in folly, as a frog might call

Upon snake in the forest: so I fall

Into this pit, TakkÄriyÄ. 
The name here is feminine, as the commentator notes without explanation.
 How true,

Words spoken out of season one must rue!â 
{4.248}

2. âThe man who out of season speaks, will go

Like this to ruin, lamentation, woe:

Here you should blame yourself, now you must have

This dug out pit, my teacher, for your grave.â

3. âWhy ask of Tuá¹á¸ila how he should fare

At KÄlikÄ his sisterâs hands? Now see!

My clothes are gone, naked am I and bare;

âTis monstrous like what happened late to you.â 
{4.250}

4. âBetween two fighting rams a fork-tail flew,

Though in the fray he had no part nor share.

The two ramsâ heads did crush him then and there.

He in his fate was monstrous like to you!â

5. âFour men, to save a fellow from his fate,

Held the four corners of a cloth below.

They all fell dead, each with a broken pate.

These men were monstrous like to you, I know.â

6. âA female goat, in a bamboo thicket bound,

Frisking about, herself a knife had found.

With that same knife they cut the creatureâs throat.

It strikes me you are monstrous like that goat.â 
{4.252}

7. âNo devas are these neither gandhabbas, 
gandhabbaputtÄ
.

Beasts brought by one who fain would fill his purse.

So for my supper let them cook me one,

And one for breakfast by the morrowâs sun.â

8. âA hundred thousand ditties all sung wrong

All are not worth a tithe of one good song.

To sing ill is a crime; and this is why

(Not from folly) Kimpurisa 
[It seems that Kinnara and Kimpurisa are equivalent terms, both here and elsewhere.]
 would not try.â 
[4.160] {4.253}

9. âShe that has spoken, let her go, that she

The HimÄlaya hill again may see,

But let them take and kill the other one,

And for tomorrowâs breakfast have him done.â

10. âThe kine depend upon the clouds, 
Because their food (grass etc.) depends on rain.
 and men upon the kine,

And I, O king! Depend on you, on me this wife of mine.

Let one, before he seek the hills, the otherâs fate divine.â

11. âO monarch! Other peoples, other ways:

âTis very hard to keep you clear of blame. 
{4.254}

The very thing which for the one wins praise,

Another finds reproof for just the same.


12. Some one there is who each man foolish finds; 
Reading 
paracitte:
 âeverybody is foolish in some other manâs opinion.â In line 2, there may be a pun on 
citto
 (various): âall the world becomes different through the power of thought.â

Each by imagination different still;

All different, many men and many minds,

No universal law is one manâs will.â

13. âSilent they were, the Kimpurisa and his mate:

And he who now did utter speech for fear,

Unhurt, free, happy, let him go his gait.

This is the speech brings good, as oft we hear.â

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he said: âThis is not the first time, monks, that KokÄlika was destroyed by his own words, but it was the same before,â after which he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time KokÄlika was the tawny-brown man, and I myself was the wise TakkÄriya.â

## Full Story
âI bring you tidings.â
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling in the Bamboo Grove, about Devadatta. One might say to him, âThe Teacher is most useful to you, friend Devadatta. You received holy orders from the TathÄgata, from him you learned the Three Baskets, you obtained gifts and honour.â When such things were said, it is credibly reported he would reply, âNo, friend; the Teacher has done me no good, not so much as a blade of grass worth. Of myself I received holy orders, myself I learned the Three Baskets, by myself I gained gifts and honour.â In the Dhamma Hall the monks talked of all this, âUngrateful is Devadatta, my friend, and forgets a kindness done.â The Teacher came in, and asked what they talked of sitting there. They told him. Said he, âIt is not now the first time, monks, that Devadatta is ungrateful, but he was ungrateful before; and in days long gone by his life was saved by me, yet he knew not the greatness of my merit.â So saying, he told a story of the past.

1. âWho brings me tidings of that deer, choicest of all the breed?

Fair women and a choice village who wins him for his meed?â

2. âI bring you tidings of that deer, choicest of all the breed:

Fair women and a village choice then give me for my meed.â

3. âWithin that clump of flowering SÄl and mango, where the ground

Is all as red as cochineal, this deer is to be found.â

4. âForward he went: the bow was bent, the arrow on the string; 
This line is almost identical with iii. 274. 12 (p. 174, line 12 of this translation).

When thus from far the deer called out, as he beheld the king:


5. âO lord of charioteers, great king, stand still! And do not wound:

Who brought the news to you, that here this deer was to be found?â â 
{4.259}

6. âThat sinful man, my worthy friend, that yonder stands his ground,

He brought the news to me, that here the deer was to be found.â

7. âUpon the earth are many men, of whom the proverbâs true:

âTwere better save a drowning log than such a one as you.â 
These lines are found in vol. i. p. 326. 8 (i. 180 of this translation).

8. âWho is it you would blame in this, O deer?

Is it some man, or is it beast or bird? 
{4.260}

I am possessed with an unbounded fear

At this your human speech which late I hear.â

9. âI saved him once, when like to drown

On the swift swelling tide that bore him down:

And now I am in danger through it.

Go with the wicked, and be sure youâll rue it.â

10. âThis four-winged flyer Iâll let fly,

And pierce him to the heart! So let him perish,

The evil-doer in his treachery,

Who for such kindness done no thanks did cherish!â 
[4.165]

11. âShame on the fool, O king, indeed!

But no good men approve a killing;

Let the wretch go, and give his meed,

All that you promised him fulfilling:

And I will serve you at your need.â

12. âSurely this deer is good indeed,

To pay back ill for ill unwilling.

Let the wretch go! I give his meed,

All that I promised him fulfilling.

And you go where you will â good speed!â

13. âThe cry of jackals and of birds is understood with ease;

Yea, but the word of men, O king, is harder far than these.


14. A man may think, âThis is my friend, my comrade, of my kin;â

But friendship goes, and often hate and enmity begin.â 
These lines have been used before: pages 135 and 141.

15. âThe country-folk and townsfolk all straight to the king they went:

The deer are eating up our crops: this let the king prevent!â

16. âBe it the peopleâs wish or no, eâen if my kingdom cease,

I cannot wrong the deer, to whom I promised life and peace.


17. The people may desert me all, my royal power may die,

The boon I gave that royal deer I never will deny.â

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he said: âThis is not the first time, monks, that Devadatta has been ungrateful,â and then he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time, Devadatta was the merchantâs son, Änanda was the king, and I myself was the deer.â

## Full Story
âToil on, O man.â
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling in Jetavana, to explain fully a question concisely put by himself to the Captain of the Dhamma.


At that time the Teacher put a question concisely to that elder. This is the full story, put briefly, of the descent from the world of gods. When the venerable Piá¹á¸ola BhÄradvÄja had by his Supernormal Powers gained the sandalwood bowl in the presence of the great merchant of RÄjagaha, 
The story is told in 
Cullavagga
, v. 8 (
Vinaya Texts,
 iii. p. 78, in the 
Sacred Books of the East
). The 
seá¹­á¹­hi
 had placed a sandalwood bowl on a high pole, and challenged any holy person to get it down. Piá¹á¸ola rose in the air by magic power and took it. For this he was blamed by the Master, as having used his great gift for an unworthy end.
 the Teacher forbade the monks to use their miraculous Supernormal Powers. 
[4.167]


Then the schismatics thought: âThe ascetic Gotama has forbidden the use of miraculous Supernormal Powers: now he will do no miracle himself.â Their disciples were disturbed, and said to the schismatics, âWhy didnât you take the bowl by your Supernormal Powers?â They replied, âThis is no hard thing for us, friend. But we think, âWho will display before the laity his own fine and subtle powers for the sake of a paltry wooden bowl?â and so we did not take it. The ascetics of the Sakya class took it, and showed their Supernormal Powers for sheer foolish greed. Do not imagine it is any trouble to us to work miracles. Suppose we leave out of consideration the disciples of Gotama the ascetic: if we like, we too will show our Supernormal Powers with the ascetic Gotama himself: if the ascetic Gotama works one miracle, we will work one twice as good.â


The monks who heard this told the Fortunate One of it, âSir, the schismatics say they will work a miracle.â Said the Teacher, âLet them do it, monks; I will do the like.â BimbisÄra, hearing this, went and asked the Fortunate One, âWill you work a miracle, sir?â âYes, O king.â âWas there not a command given on this matter, sir?â âThe command, O king, was given to my disciples; there is no command which can rule the Buddhas. 
{4.264}
 When the flowers and fruit in your park are forbidden 
Reading 
vÄritaá¹
.
 to others, the same rule does not apply to you.â âThen where will you work this miracle, sir?â âAt SÄvatthi, under Gaá¹á¸aâs mango tree.â âWhat have I to do, then?â âNothing, sire.â


Next day, after breaking his fast, the Teacher went to seek alms. âWhither goes the Teacher?â asked the people. The monks answered to them, âAt the gate of the city of SÄvatthi, beneath Gaá¹á¸aâs mango tree, he is to work a twofold miracle to the confounding of the schismatics.â The crowd said: âThis miracle will be what they call a masterpiece; we will go see it,â leaving the doors of their houses, they went along with the Teacher. Some of the schismatics also followed the Teacher, with their disciples, âWe too,â they said, âwill work a miracle, in the place where the ascetic Gotama shall work his.â


By and by the Teacher arrived at SÄvatthi. The king asked him, âIs it true, sir, you are about to work a miracle, as they say?â âYes, it is true,â he said. âWhen?â asked the king. âOn the seventh day from now, at the full moon of the month of July.â âShall I set up a pavilion, sir?â âPeace, great king: in the place where I shall work my miracle Sakka will set up a pavilion of jewels twelve leagues in compass.â âShall I proclaim this thing through the city, sir?â âProclaim it, O king.â The king sent forth the announcer of the Dhamma on an elephant richly caparisoned, to proclaim thus, âNews! The Teacher is about to perform a miracle, for the confounding of the schismatics, at the Gate of SÄvatthi, under Gaá¹á¸aâs mango tree, seven days from now!â Each day was this proclamation made. When the schismatics heard this news, that the miracle will be done under Gaá¹á¸aâs mango tree, they had all the mango trees near to SÄvatthi cut down, paying the owners for them.


On the night of the full moon the announcer of the Dhamma made proclamation, âThis day 
The Eastern day is reckoned from sunset to sunset.
 in the morning the miracle will take place.â By the power of the gods it was as though all JambudÄ«pa was at the door and heard the proclamation; whosoever had it in his heart to go, they all betook themselves to SÄvatthi: for twelve leagues the crowd extended.


Early in the morning the Teacher went on his rounds seeking alms. The kingâs gardener, Gaá¹á¸a by name, was just taking to the king a fine ripe mango fruit; thoroughly ripe, big as a bushel, when he espied the Teacher at the city gate. âThis fruit is worthy of the TathÄgata,â said he, and gave it to him. The Teacher took it, and sitting down then and there on one side, ate the fruit. When it was eaten, he said: âÄnanda, give the gardener this stone to plant here on the spot; 
{4.265}
 this shall be Gaá¹á¸aâs mango tree.â The elder did so.


The gardener dug a hole in the earth, and planted it. On the 
[4.168]
 instant the stone burst, roots sprouted forth, up sprang a red shoot tall as a plough-pole; even as the crowd stared it grew into a mango tree of a hundred cubits, with a trunk fifty cubits and branches of fifty cubits in height; at the same time flowers bloomed, fruit ripened; the tree stood filling the sky, covered with bees, laden with golden fruit; when the wind blew on it, sweet fruits fell; then the monks came up and ate of the fruit, and retired.


In the evening time the King of the Devas, reflecting, perceived that it was a task laid on him to make a pavilion of the seven precious things. So he sent the Devaputta Vissakamma, and caused him to make a pavilion of the seven precious things, twelve leagues in compass, covered all over with blue lotus. Thus the gods of ten thousand spheres were gathered together. The Teacher, for the confounding of the schismatics having performed a twofold miracle passing marvellous among his disciples, caused faith to spring up in multitudes, then arose and, sitting in the Buddhaâs seat, declared the Dhamma. Twenty crores of beings drank of the waters of life. Then, meditating to see whither it was that former Buddhas went when they had done a miracle, and perceiving that it was to the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, up he rose from the Buddhaâs seat, the right foot he placed on the top of Mount Yugandhara, 
Mount Meru or Sineru, the Indian Olympus, is surrounded by seven concentric circles of hills, the innermost of which is Yugandhara.
 and with his left strode to the peak of Sineru, he began the Rains Retreat under the great Coral Tree, 
The tree named is the Erythmia Indica; a great one grew in Indraâs heaven.
 seated upon the yellow-stone throne; for the space of three months he discoursed upon the Abhidhamma to the gods.


The people knew not the place whither the Teacher had gone; they looked, and said: âLet us go home,â and lived in that place during the rainy season. When the rainy season was near to its end, and the feast was at hand, the great elder MoggallÄna went and announced it to the Fortunate One. Thereupon the Teacher asked him, âWhere is SÄriputta now?â âHe, sir, after the miracle which delighted him, remained with five hundred monks in the city of Saá¹kassa, and is there still.â âMoggallÄna, on the seventh day from now I shall descend by the gate of Saá¹kassa. Let those who desire to behold the TathÄgata assemble in the city of Saá¹kassa.â The elder assented, went and told the people: the whole company he transported from SÄvatthi to Saá¹kassa, a distance of thirty leagues, in the twinkling of an eye.


The Rains Retreat over, and the Invitation celebrated, the Teacher told king Sakka that he was about to return to the world of men. Then Sakka sent for Vissakamma, and said to him, âMake a stairway for the One with Ten Powers to descend into the world of men.â He placed the head of the stairway upon the peak of Sineru, and the foot of it by the gate of Saá¹kassa, and between he made three stairways side by side: one of gems, one of silver, and one of gold: 
{4.266}
 the balustrade and cornice were of the seven things of price. The Teacher, having performed a miracle for the worldâs emancipation, descended by the midmost stair made out of gems. Sakka carried the bowl and robe, SuyÄma a yakâs-tail fan, Brahma, the lord of all beings bore a sunshade, and the deities of the ten thousand spheres worshipped with divine garlands and perfumes. When the Teacher stood at the foot of the staircase, first elder SÄriputta gave him greeting, afterwards the rest of the company.


Amidst this assembly the Teacher thought: âMoggallÄna has been shown to possess supernatural power, UpÄli as one who is versed in the sacred law, but the quality of high wisdom possessed by SÄriputta has not been shown. Save and except me, no other possesses wisdom so full and complete as his; I will make known the quality of his wisdom.â First of all he asked a question which is put to ordinary persons [puthujjana], and the ordinary persons answered it. Then he asked a question within the scope of those of the First Path, and this they of the First Path answered, but the ordinary folk knew nought of it. In the same way he asked questions in turn within the scope of those of the Second and 
[4.169]
 Third Paths, of the Arahats, of the chief disciples; and in each case those who were below each grade in turn were unable to answer, but they who were above could answer. Then he put a question within the power of SÄriputta, and this the elder could answer, but the others not so. The people asked, âWho is this elder who answered the Teacher?â They were told, it was the Captain of the Dhamma, and SÄriputta was his name. âAh, great is his wisdom!â they said. Ever afterwards the quality of the elderâs great wisdom was known to men and to gods. Then the Teacher said to him,

âSome have probations yet to pass, and some have reached the goal:

Their different behaviours say, for you do know the whole.â 
Saá¹khatadhamma
 seems to mean an 
arahÄ
 or 
asekha
. [Snp 5.1, 
AjitamÄá¹avapucchÄ
.]

Having thus asked a question which comes within a Buddhaâs scope, he added, âHere is a point put with brevity, SÄriputta; what is the meaning of the matter in all its bearings?â The elder considered the problem. He thought: âThe Teacher asks of the proper behaviour with which the monks attain progress, both those who are in the lower Paths and those who are Arahats?â As to the general question, he had no doubt. But then he considered, âThe proper manner of behaviour may be described in many ways of speaking according to the essential elements of being, 
The five 
khandhas
.
 and so forth from that beginning; now in what fashion can I hit the Teacherâs meaning?â He was doubtful about the meaning. The Teacher thought: âSÄriputta has no doubt of the general question, but doubts what particular side of it I have in view. If I give no clue, he will never be able to answer, so a clue 
{4.267}
 I will give him.â This clue he gave by saying: âSee here, SÄriputta: you grant this to be true?â (mentioning some point). SÄriputta granted the point.


The hint thus given, he knew that SÄriputta had taken his meaning, and would answer fully, starting from the very elements of being. Then the question stood out clear before the elder, as with a hundred hints, nay, a thousand; and he, at the Teacherâs hint given, answered the question which belonged to a Buddhaâs scope.


The Teacher declared the Dhamma to this company which covered twelve leagues of ground: thirty crores of beings drank of the waters of life.


The company was dismissed, and the Teacher, going on pilgrimage for alms, came by and by to SÄvatthi. Next day, after seeking alms in SÄvatthi, he came back from his rounds, and told the monks of their duty, and entered his Perfumed Chamber. At evening time, the monks talked of the high worth of the elder as they sat in the Dhamma Hall. âGreat in wisdom, sirs, is SÄriputta; he has wisdom wide, wisdom swift, wisdom sharp, wisdom keen. The One of Ten Powers put a question in brief, and he answered it fully at large.â The Teacher entered and asked what they talked about as they sat there. They told him. âThis is not the first time, monks,â said he, âthat he answered at large a question briefly put, but he has done so before,â and he told them a story.

1. âHope on O man, if you be wise, nor let your courage tire:

Myself I see, who now have won the goal of my desire. 
The same verse has occurred already in vol. i. p. 267 (i. 133 of this translation). The first line is found also in i. 450 (translation i. 274).


2. Hope on O man, if you be wise, tire not though harassed sore:

Myself I see, who from the waves have fought my way ashore. 
The same verse in i. 268 (translation i. 133).


3. Toil on O man, if you be wise, nor let your courage tire:

Myself I see, who now have won the goal of my desire.


4. Toil on O man, if you be wise, tire not though harassed sore:

Myself I see, who from the waves have fought my way ashore.


5. He that is wise, though overcome with pain,

Would never cease to hope for bliss again. 
{4.270}

Many are menâs feelings, both of joy and woe:

They think not of it, yet to death they go.


6. That comes to pass which is not thought; and that is thought of, fails:

For man or womanâs happiness not thought alone avails.â

7. âThe stag that on a mountain steep your quarry was of late,

He bravely gave you life, for he was free from greed and hate.


8. Out of the horrid pit, out of deathâs jaws,

Leaning upon a rock (a friend-at need)

The great stag saved you: so you say with cause,

His mind is far aloof from hate or greed.â

9. âO brahmin! Were you there upon that day?

Or from some other witness did you hear?

The veil of passion you have rolled away:

You see all: your wisdom makes me fear.â

10. âO lord of men! I neither heard that thing,

Nor was I there to see that day: 
{4.272}

But from the verses you did sweetly sing

Wise men can gather how the matter lay.â

11. âYour shaft is death to many a mighty thing:

Why do you hold it quiet on the string?

Let the shaft fly and kill the stag forthwith:

âTis meat for monarchs, O most sapient king!â 
{4.273}

12. âI know it, brahmin, no less sure than you:

The stag is meat for warrior men, I vow,

But I am grateful for a service done,

And therefore hold my hand from killing now.â

13. â âTis no stag, O mighty monarch! But an Asura is this thing,

You are king of men; but kill it â of the gods you shall be king.


14. But if you hesitate, O valiant king!

To kill the stag, because he is your friend:

To deathâs cold river 
Vetaraá¹Ä«.
 and to deathâs dread king 
Yama.

You and your wife and children shall descend.â

15. âSo be it: to deathâs river and deathâs king

Send me, my wives and children, all my train

Of friends and comrades; Iâll not do this thing,

And by my hand this stag shall not be slain. 
{4.274}


16. Once in a grisly forest full of dread

That very stag saved me from hopeless woe.

How can I wish my benefactor dead

After such service done me long ago?â

17. âLive long on earth, O true and faithful friend!

Comfort with truth and goodness this domain;

Then hosts of maidens round you shall attend

While you as Sakka 
VÄsava.
 mid the gods shall reign.


18. From passion free, with ever-peaceful heart,

When strangers crave, supply their weary need;

As power is given you, give, and play your part, 
bhutvÄ,
 âhaving eaten,â applied to time, means to âpassâ: 
bhutvÄ
 
dvÄdasa
 
vassÄni,
 Mah. 253.

Blameless, till heaven shall be your final meed.â 
[4.174] {4.275}

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he said: âThis is not the first time, monks, that SÄriputta knew in detail what was said only in general terms; but the same thing happened before.â Then he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time Änanda was the king, SÄriputta was the family priest, and I myself the stag.â

âThe crop of rice.â
 
[4.175] {4.276}
 This was a story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana, about a monk who supported his mother. The occasion will be explained in the SÄmajÄtaka [Ja 540].

This story the Teacher told at Jetavana, about a certain monk who supported his mother. They say that there was a wealthy merchant at SÄvatthi, who was worth eighteen crores; and he had a son who was very dear and winning to his father and mother. One day the youth went upon the terrace of the house, and opened a window and looked down on the street; and when he saw the great crowd going to Jetavana with perfumes and garlands in their hands to hear the Dhamma preached, he exclaimed that he would go too.


So having ordered perfumes and garlands to be brought, he went to the monastery, and having distributed robes, medicines, drinks, etc. to the assembly and honoured the Fortunate One with perfumes and garlands, he sat down on one side. After hearing the Dhamma, and perceiving the evil consequences of desire and the blessings arising from adopting the ascetic life, when the assembly broke up he asked the Fortunate One for ordination, but he was told that the TathÄgatas do not ordain anyone who has not obtained the permission of his parents; so he went away, and lived a week without food, and having at last obtained his parentsâ consent, he returned and begged for ordination. The Teacher sent a monk who ordained him; and after he was ordained he obtained great honour and gain; he won the favour of his teachers and preceptors, and having received full orders he mastered the Dhamma in five years.


Then he thought to himself, âI live here distracted â it is not suitable for me,â and he became anxious to reach the goal of insight; so having obtained instruction in meditation from his teacher, he departed to a frontier village and dwelt in the forest, and there having entered a course of insight, however much he laboured and strove for twelve years, he failed to attain any special insight.


His parents also, as time went on, became poor, for those who hired their land or carried on merchandise for them, finding out that there was no son or brother in the family to enforce the payment, seized what they could lay their hands upon and ran away as they pleased, and the servants and labourers in the house seized the gold and coin and made off therewith, so that at the end the two were reduced to an evil plight and had not even a jug for pouring water; and at last they sold their dwelling, and finding themselves homeless, and in extreme misery, they wandered begging for alms, clothed in rags and carrying potsherds in their hands.


Now at that time a monk came from Jetavana to the sonâs place of abode; he performed the duties of hospitality and, as he sat quietly, he first asked whence he was come; and learning that he was come from Jetavana he asked after the health of the Teacher and the principal disciples and then asked for news of his parents, âTell me, sir, about the welfare of such and such a merchantâs family in SÄvatthi.â âO friend, donât ask for news of that family.â âWhy not, sir?â âThey say that there was one son in that family, but he has become an ascetic in this dispensation, and since he left the world that family has gone to ruin; and at the present time the two old people are reduced to a most lamentable state and beg for alms.â


When he heard the otherâs words he could not remain unmoved, but began to weep with his eyes full of tears, and when the other asked him why he wept, âO sir,â he replied, âthey are my own father and mother, I am their son.â âO friend, your father and mother have come to ruin through you â do you go and take care of them.â âFor twelve years,â he thought to himself, âI have laboured and striven but never been able to attain the Path or the Fruit: I must be incompetent; what have I to do with the ascetic life? I will become a householder and will support my parents and give away my wealth, and will thus eventually become destined for heaven.â


So having determined he gave up his abode in the forest to the elder, and the next day departed and by successive stages reached the monastery at the back of Jetavana which is not far from SÄvatthi. There he found two roads, one leading to Jetavana, the other to SÄvatthi. As he stood there, he thought: âShall I see my parents first or the One with Ten Powers?â Then he said to himself, âIn old days I saw my parents for a long time, from henceforth I shall rarely have the chance of seeing the Buddha; I will see the Fully Awakened One today and hear the Dhamma, and then tomorrow morning I will see my parents.â So he left the road to SÄvatthi and in the evening arrived at Jetavana.


Now that very day at daybreak, the Teacher, as he looked upon the world, had seen the potentialities of this young man, and when he came to visit him he praised the virtues of parents in the MÄtiposakasutta [SN 7.19]. As he stood at the end of the assembly of elders and listened, he thought: âIf I become a householder I can support my parents; but the Teacher also says, âA son who has become an ascetic can be helpful,â I went away before without seeing the Teacher, and I failed in such an imperfect ordination; I will now support my parents while still remaining an ascetic without becoming a householder.â So he took his ticket and his ticket-food and gruel, and felt as if he had committed a wrong deserving expulsion after a solitary abode of twelve years in the forest. In the morning he went to SÄvatthi and he thought to himself, âShall I first get the gruel or see my parents?â He reflected that it would not be right to visit them in their poverty empty-handed; so he first got the gruel and then went to the door of their old house.


When he saw them sitting by the opposite wall after having gone their round for the alms given in broth, he stood not far from them in a sudden burst of sorrow with his eyes full of tears. They saw him but knew him not; then his mother, thinking that it was someone standing for alms, said to him, âWe have nothing fit to be given to you, be pleased to pass on.â When he heard her, he repressed the grief which filled his heart and remained still standing as before with his eyes full of tears, and when he was addressed a second and a third time he still continued standing.


At last the father said to the mother, âGo to him; can this be your son?â She rose and went to him and, recognising him, fell at his feet and lamented, and the father also joined his lamentations, and there was a loud outburst of sorrow. To see his parents he could not control himself, but burst into tears; then, after yielding to his feelings, he said: âDo not grieve, I will support you,â so having comforted them and made them drink some gruel, and sit down on one side, he went again and begged for some food and gave it to them, and then went and asked for alms for himself, and having finished his meal, took up his abode at a short distance off.


From that day forward he watched over his parents in this manner; he gave them all the alms he received for himself, even those at the fortnightly distributions, and he went on separate expeditions for his own alms, and ate them; and whatever food he received as provision for the rainy season he gave to them, while he took their worn-out garments and dyed them with the doors fast closed and used them himself; but the days were few when he gained alms and there were many when he failed to win anything, and his inner and outer clothing became very rough.


As he watched over his parents he gradually grew very pale and thin and his friends and intimates said to him, âYour complexion used to be bright, but now you have become very pale â has some illness come upon you?â He replied, âNo illness has come upon me, but a hindrance has befallen me,â and he told them the history. âSir,â they replied, âthe Teacher does not allow us to waste the offerings of the faithful, you do an unlawful act in giving to laymen the offerings of the faithful.â When he heard this he shrank away ashamed.


But not satisfied with this they went and told it to the Teacher, saying: âSo and so, sir, has wasted the offerings of the faithful and used them to feed laymen.â

Then the Teacher sent for this monk, and asked him, âIs what I hear true, monk, that you support lay folks?â âIt is true, sir.â âWho are they?â âMy mother and father, sir.â Said the Teacher, âWell done, monk! Wise men of old, even when embodied as lower animals, having been born as parrots even, when their parents grew old laid them in a nest and fed them with food which they brought in their own beaks.â So saying, he told a story of the past.

1. âThe crop of rice is very nice, but I would have you know,

The parrots are devouring it, I cannot make them go.


2. There is one bird, of all the herd the finest, who first feeds,

Then takes a bundle in his beak to meet his future needs.â

3. âThen set a snare of horseâs hair that captured he may be;

And see you take the bird alive and bring him here to me.â

4. âThey ate, they drank, and now away they hasten every one,

I only caught within a snare: what evil have I done?â

5. âThe bellies of all others are outbellied far by you:

First a full meal, then off you fly with a good beak-full too!


6. Have you a granary there to fill? Or do you hate me sore?

I ask it you, come tell me true â where do you put your store?â

7. âI hate you not, O Kosiya! No granary I own;

Once in my wood I pay a debt, and also grant a loan,

And there I store a treasure up: so be my answer known.â

8. âWhat is that loan the which you grant? What is the debt you pay?

Tell me the treasure you store up, and then fly free away.â

9. âMy callow chicks, my tender brood, whose wings are still ungrown,

Who shall support me by and by: to them I grant the loan.


10. Then my old ancient parents, who far from youthâs bounds are set,

With that within my beak I bring, to them I pay my debt.


11. And other birds of helpless wing, and weak full many more,

To these I give in generosity: this sages call my store.


12. This is that loan the which I grant, this is the debt I pay,

And this the treasure I store up: now I have said my say.â 
[4.178]

13. âWhat noble principles of life! How blessed is this bird!

From many men who live on earth such rules are never heard. 
{4.281}


14. Eat, eat your fill whereas you will, with all your kindred too;

And, parrot! Let us meet-again: I love the sight of you.â

15. âO Kosiya! Within your dwelling here

I had both food and drink and friendship dear.

Give you to those whose burden is laid down,

Support your parents when they old are grown.â

16. âSurely Luckâs goddess came herself today

When I set eyes upon this peerless bird!

I will do kindly deeds and never stay,

Now that the parrotâs sweet voice I have heard.â

17. âThis Kosiya with joy and great delight

Common and plentiful made drink and food:

With food and drink he satisfied aright

Brahmins and holy men, himself all good.â

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he said: âThus, monks, to support oneâs parents is the traditional way of the wise and good.â Then, having declared the Truths, he identified the JÄtaka, now at the conclusion of the Truths that monk became established in the fruit of the First Path. âAt that time the Buddhaâs followers were the flock of parrots, two of the kingâs family were the father and mother, Channa was the watchman, Änanda the brahmin, and I was myself the king of the parrots.â

## Full Story
âIt is passing away.â
 
[4.179]
 This is a story which the Teacher told, while dwelling in the banyan grove nearby Kapilapura about RÄhulaâs mother when she was in the palace.


This JÄtaka must be told beginning from the Distant Epoch of the Buddhaâs existence. 
The existence of the Buddha is divided into three periods: the Distant Epoch 
(dÅ«renidÄnaá¹),
 the Middle 
(avidÅ«reÂ°)
 and the Near 
(santikeÂ°).
 The Distant Epoch extends âfrom the time when he fell at the feet of DÄ«paá¹kara to his birth in the city of the Tusita godsâ (Jat. i. p. 47, Pali text): the Middle Epoch from that time until he obtained Buddhahood (Jat. i. 76); the Near Epoch, until his death. â See Rhys Davidâs 
Buddhist Birth Stories,
 pp. 2, 58; Warren, 
Buddhism in Translations,
 pp. 38, 82.
 But the story of the Epochs, as far as the lionâs roar of Kassapa 
One of three brahmin brothers living at UruvelÄ, converted by the Buddha.
 of UruvelÄ, in Laá¹­á¹­hivana, 
Near RÄjagaha: Jat. i. 84 (Pali).
 the Bamboo Forest, has been told before in the Apaá¹á¹akajÄtaka [Ja 1]. 
[This reference would seem to indicate that the commentator understood the NidÄnakathÄ to belong to the first JÄtaka.]
 Beginning from that point you will read in the VessantarajÄtaka [Ja 547] the continuation of it as far as to the coming to Kapilavatthu. The Teacher, seated in his fatherâs house, during the meal, recounted the MahÄdhammapÄlajÄtaka [Ja 447]; and after the meal was done he said: âI will praise the noble qualities of RÄhulaâs mother in her own house, by telling the CandakinnarajÄtaka [Ja 485].â Then handing his bowl to the king, with the two chief disciples he passed over to the house of RÄhulaâs mother. At that time there were forty thousand dancing girls who lived in her presence, and of them a thousand and ninety were maidens of the warrior caste. When the lady heard of the TathÄgataâs coming she bade all these put on yellow robes, and they did so. 
{4.283}
 The Teacher came and took his seat in a place which was assigned him. Then all the women cried out with one voice, and there was a great sound of lamentation. RÄhulaâs mother having wept and so put away her grief, welcomed the Teacher, and sat down, with the deep reverence due to a king.


Then the king began the tale of her goodness, âListen to me, sir; she heard that you wore yellow robes, and so she robed herself in yellow; that garlands and such things are to be given up, and lo she has given up garlands and sits upon the ground. When you entered upon the ascetic life she became a widow; and refused the gifts that other kings sent her. So faithful is her heart to you.â Thus he told of her goodness in many different ways. The Teacher said: âIt is no marvel, great king! That now in my last existence the lady should love me, and should be of faithful heart and led by me alone. So also, even when born as an animal, she was faithful and mine alone.â Then at the kingâs request he told a story of the past.

1. â âTis passing away, I think, and my blood is flowing, flowing,

I am losing my hold on life, O CandÄ! My breath is going!


2. âTis sinking, I am in pain, my heart is burning, burning:

But âtis for your sorrow, CandÄ, the heart within me is yearning.


3. As grass, as a tree I perish, as a waterless river I dry:

But âtis for your sorrow, CandÄ, my heart within me is yearning.


4. As rain on a lake at the mountain foot are the tears that fall from my eye:

But âtis for your sorrow, CandÄ, my heart within me is yearning.â

5. âThat evil prince â ah, woe is me! â my husband dear did wound,

Who there beneath a woodland tree now lies upon the ground.


6. O prince! The woe that wrings my heart may your own mother pay,

The woe that wrings my heart with my Kimpurisa 
[A synonym for a 
Kinnara

 dead this day!


7. Yea, prince! The woe that wrings my heart may your own wife repay,

The woe that wrings my heart with my Kimpurisa dead this day!


8. And may your mother mourn her lord, and may she mourn her son,

Who on my lord most innocent for lust this deed have done.


9. And may your wife look on and see the loss of lord and son,

For you upon my harmless lord for lust this deed have done.â

10. âWeep not nor grieve: the woodland dark has blinded you, I ween:

A royal house shall honour you, and you shall be my queen.â 
{4.286}

11. âNo! I will surely slay myself! Thine I will never be,

Who slew innocent Kimpurisa, and all for lust for me.â

12. âLive if you will, O timid one! To the HimÄlayas go:

Creatures that feed on shrub and tree 
Two are named, Corypha Taliera and Tabernaemontana Coronaria.

13. âHere in the hills and mountain caves, in many a glen and grot,

What shall I do, O Kimpurisa, now that I see you not?


14. The wild beasts range, the leaves are spread on many a lovely spot:

What shall I do, O Kimpurisa, now that I see you not?


15. The wild beasts range, sweet flowers are spread on many a lovely spot:

What shall I do, O Kimpurisa, now that I see you not? 
{4.287}


16. Clear run the rivers down the hills, with flowers all overgrown:

What shall I do, O Kimpurisa, now you have left me lone?


17. Blue are the HimÄlaya hills, most fair they are to see:

What shall I do, O Kimpurisa, now I behold not you? 
[4.182]


18. Gold tips the HimÄlaya hills, most fair they are to see:

19. The HimÄlaya hills glow red, most fair they are to see:

20. Sharp are the HimÄlaya peaks, they are most fair to see:

21. White gleam the HimÄlaya peaks, they are most fair to see:

What shall I do, O Kimpurisa, now I behold not you?

What shall I do, O Kimpurisa, now that I see you not?


24. The Kimpurisas love the Fragrant Hill, plants cover every spot:

25. âPraise, holy brahmin! Who did give unto a hapless wife

Her well-loved husband, sprinkling him with the elixir of life!â

26. âTo the mountain let us go,

Where the lovely rivers flow,

Rivers all oâergrown with flowers:

There for ever, while the breeze

Whispers in a thousand trees,

Charm with talk the happy hours.â

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he said: âNot only now, but long ago as now, she was devoted and faithful of heart to me.â Then he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time Anuruddha was [Sakka, Devadatta was]

## Full Story
âThe country churls.â
 
[4.183]
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana, about Mittagandhaka, a lay brother. 
{4.289}
 This man, they say, the offspring of a decayed family at SÄvatthi, sent a companion to offer marriage to a young gentlewoman. The question was asked, âHas he friend or comrade who can dispose of any matter that needs looking to?â Reply was made, âNo, there was none.â âThen he must make some friends first,â they said to him. The man followed this advice, and struck up a friendship with the four gatekeepers. After this he made friends by degrees with the town warders, the astrologers, the nobles of the court, even with the commander-in-chief and the viceroy; and by association with them he became the kingâs friend, and after that a friend of the eighty chief elders, and through elder Änanda, with the TathÄgata himself.


Then the Teacher established his family in the Refuges and the Precepts, the king gave him high place, and he was known as Mittagandhaka, the âman of many friends.â 
Literally âbinder of friends.â
 The king bestowed a great house upon him, and caused his nuptial feast to be celebrated, and a world of people from the king downwards sent him gifts. Then his wife received a present sent by the king, and the viceroyâs present sent by the viceroy, and the present of the commander-in-chief, and so forth, having all the people of the city bound to her. On the seventh day, with great ceremony the One with Ten Powers was invited by the newly married pair, great gifts were bestowed on the Buddha and his company to the number of five hundred; at the end of the feast they received the Teacherâs thanks and were both established in the fruit of the First Path.


In the Dhamma Hall all were talking about it. âMonks, the layman Mittagandhaka followed his wifeâs advice, and by her means became a friend to everyone, and received great honour at the kingâs hand; and having become friends with the TathÄgata both husband and wife were established in the fruit of the First Path.â The Teacher entered and asked what they talked of. They told him. He said: âThis is not the first time, monks, that this man has received great honour by reason of this woman. In days long gone by, when he was an animal, by her advice he made many friends, and was set free from anxiety on a sonâs behalf.â So saying he told a story of the past.

1. âThe country churls build fires upon the isle,

To eat my young ones in a little while:

O hawk! To friend and comrade give the word,

My childrenâs danger tell to every bird!â

2. âO wingÃ¨d fowl! The chief of birds are thou:

So, osprey king, I seek your shelter now.

Some country-folk hunting now are fain

To eat my young: be you my joy again!â

3. âIn season, out of season, wise men make

Both friends and comrades for protectionâs sake:

For you, O hawk! I will perform this deed;

The good must help each other at their need.â 
{4.292}

4. âGood help the good: the necessary deed

You have in pity done for us at need.

Our young are safe, you living: have a care

Of your own self, nor all your strength outwear.â

5. âWhile I am keeping guard about this tree,

I care not if I lose my life for you:

So use the good: thus friend will do for friend:

Yea, even if he perish at the end.â 
{4.293}

6. âThe egg-born bird that flies the air did a most painful work,

The osprey, guarding well the chicks before the midnight mark.â

7. âEven they who fall through wrong or evil deed

May rise again if they get help in need.

My young in danger, straight I fly to you:

O dweller in the lake, come, succour me!â

8. âThe good man to a man who is his friend,

Both food and goods, even life itself, will lend.

For you, O hawk! I will perform this deed:

The good must help each other at their need.â 
[4.186]

9. âHere at your ease remain, O father mine,

And I your son will do this task of thine. 
{4.294}

A son should serve a father, so âtis best;

Iâll save the hawk his young ones in the nest.â

10. âSo do the good, my son, and it is true

That son for father service ought to do.

Yet they may leave the hawkâs young brood alone,

Perchance, if they see me so fully grown.â

11. âMightiest of all the beasts, both beasts and men

Fly to the strongest when beset with fear.

My young ones are in danger; help me then:

You are our king, and therefore I am here.â

12. âYes, I will do this service, hawk, for you:

Come, let us go and slay this gang of foes!

Surely the prudent, he who wisdom knows,

Protector of a friend must try to be.â

13. âGet friends, a houseful of them without fail,

Get a great friend: a blessing heâll be found: 
Reading 
sukhÄgamÄya
.

Vain strike the arrows on a coat of mail.

And we rejoice, our younglings safe and sound.


14. By their own comradeâs help, the friend who stayed to take their part,

One chirps, the fledglings chirp reply, with notes that charm the heart.


15. The wise asks help at friendâs or comradeâs hand,

Lives happy with his goods and brood of kind:

So I, my mate, and young, together stand,

Because our friend to pity was inclined.


16. A man needs king and warriors for protection:

And these are his whose friendship is perfection:

You cravest happiness: he is famed and strong;

He surely prospers to whom friends belong.


17. Even by the poor and weak, O hawk, good friends must needs be found:

See now by kindness we and ours each one are safe and sound.


18. The bird who wins a hero strong to play a friendly part,

As you and I are happy, hawk, is happy in his heart.â 
{4.297}

The Teacher, having ended this discourse, said: âThis is not the first time, monks, that he won to bliss by his wifeâs means; it was the same before.â With these words, he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the married pair were the pair of hawks, RÄhula was the young turtle, MoggallÄna was the old turtle, SÄriputta the osprey, and I was myself the lion.

## Full Story
âWith uncleansed teeth.â
 
[4.188]
 This story the Teacher told, while dwelling in Jetavana, about a dishonest monk. This man, even though dedicated to the dispensation that leads to safety, notwithstanding to gain lifeâs necessaries fulfilled the threefold cheating practice [seeking requisites, seeking honour and hinting]. 
[Explained in the commentaries as seeking requisites, seeking honour and hinting.]


The monks brought to light all the evil parts in the man as they conversed together in the Dhamma Hall, âSuch a one, monks, after he had dedicated himself to this dispensation which leads to safety, yet lives in deceit!â The Teacher came in, and would know what they talked of there. They told him. Said he, âThis is not now the first time; he was deceitful before,â and so saying he told a story of the past. 
{4.298}

1. âWith uncleansed teeth, and goatskin garb and hair

All matted, muttering holy words in peace:

Surely no human means to good they spare,

Surely they know the truth, have won release.â 
[4.190] {4.300}

2. âA learned sage may do ill deeds, O king:

A learned sage may fail to follow right.

A thousand Vedas will not safety bring,

Failing just works, or save from evil plight.â

3. âA thousand Vedas will not safety bring

Failing just works, or save from evil plight:

The Vedas then, must be a useless thing:

True Dhamma is â control yourself, do right.â 
{4.301}

4. âNot so: the Vedas are no useless thing:

Through works with self-control, true Dhamma is.

To study well the Vedas fame will bring,

But by right conduct we attain to bliss.â

5. âParents and kinsmen claim oneâs care;

A second self our parents are:

Iâm UddÄlaka, a shoot,

Noble brahmin, from your root.â

6. âWhat makes the brahmin? How can he be perfect? Tell me this:

What is a righteous man, and how wins he NibbÄnaâs bliss?â

7. âThe world renounced, with fire, he worship pays,

Pours water, lifts the sacrificial pole:

As one who does his duty men him praise,

And such a brahmin wins him peace of soul.â

8. âNot sprinkling makes the brahmin pure, perfection is not this,

Nor peace nor kindness thus he wins nor yet NibbÄnaâs bliss.â 
[4.191]

9. âWhat makes the brahmin? How can he be perfect? Tell me this:

What is a righteous man? And how wins he NibbÄnaâs bliss?â 
{4.303}

10. âHe has no field, no goods, no wish, no kin,

Careless of life, no sensual desires, no evil ways:

Even such a brahmin peace of soul shall win,

So as one true to duty men him praise.â

11. âKhattiya, Brahmin, Vessa, Sudda, and Outcaste, Pukkusa, 
Compare above, p. 127, and note the order of the first two. cf. iii. 194.

All these can be compassionate, can win NibbÄnaâs bliss:

Who among all the saints is there who worse or better is?â

12. âKhattiya, Brahmin, Vessa, Sudda, and Outcaste, Pukkusa,

All these can be compassionate, can win NibbÄnaâs bliss:

None among all the saints is found who worse or better is.â

13. âKhattiya, Brahmin, Vessa, Sudda, and Outcaste, Pukkusa,

All these can virtuous be, and all attain NibbÄnaâs bliss:


14. None among all the saints is found who worse or better is.

You are a brahmin, then, for nought: vain is your rank, I wis.â 
{4.304}

15. âWith canvas dyed in many a tint pavilions may be made:

The roof, a many-coloured dome: one colour is the shade.


16. Even so, when men are purified, so is it here on earth:

The good perceive that they are saints, and never ask their birth.â

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he said: âThis is not the first time, monks, that the man was a cheat.â Then he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the dishonest monk was UddÄlaka, Änanda was the king, and I was the family priest.â

âMay horse and kine.â
 
[4.192]
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling in Jetavana, about a discontented monk. The circumstances will appear under the KusajÄtaka [Ja 531]. 
{4.305}

This was a tale the Teacher, while dwelling at Jetavana, told about a discontented monk. The story tells that he was of noble birth and lived at SÄvatthi, and on his heartily embracing the dispensation he adopted the ascetic life. Now one day as he was going his rounds for alms in SÄvatthi, he met a fair lady and fell in love with her at first sight. Overcome by his passion he lived an unhappy life, and letting his nails and hair grow long and wearing soiled robes, he pined away and became quite sallow, with all his veins standing out on his body. And just as in the Deva world, the Devaputtas who are destined to fall from their heavenly existence manifest five well-known signs, that is to say, their garlands wither, their robes soil, their bodies grow ill-favoured, perspiration pours from their armpits, and they no longer find pleasure in their Deva home, so too in the case of worldly monks, who fall from the Dhamma, the same five signs are to be seen: the flowers of faith wither, the robes of righteousness soil, through discontent and the effects of an evil name their persons grow ill-favoured, the sweat of corruption streams from them and they no longer delight in a life of solitude at the foot of forest trees â all these signs were to be found in him. So they brought him into the presence of the Teacher, saying: âVenerable sir, this fellow is discontented.â

Here again the Teacher asked, âIs it true, monk, that you are discontent?â âYes, sir, it is true.â âFor what cause?â âFor lustâs sake, sir.â âMonk why are you discontent, after embracing such a faith as this which leads to safety; and all for lustâs sake? In days of yore, before the Buddha arose, wise men who took to the ascetic life, even they who were ordained in an outside sect, made an oath, and renounced a suggested idea connected with temptations or desires!â So saying, he told a story of the past.

1. âMay horse and kine be his, may silver, gold,

A loving wife, these may he precious hold,

May he have sons and daughters manifold,

Brahmin, who stole your share of food away.â 
The meaning is, that a man whose heart is set on these things feels pain to part with them, and is hence unfit to die from a Buddhist point of view. The verse is therefore a curse.
 
[4.195]

2. âMay he have sons and raiment at his will,

Garlands and sandal sweet his hands may fill,

His heart be fierce with lust and longing still,

Brahmin, who stole your share of food away.â

3. âMay he have plenty, win both fame and land,

Sons, houses, treasures, all at his command,

The passing years may he not understand,

Brahmin, who stole your share of food away.â


4. âAs mighty warrior chief may he be known,

As king of kings set on a glorious throne,

The earth and its four corners all his own,

Brahmin, who stole your share of food away.â


5. âBe he a brahmin, passion unsubdued,

With faith in stars and lucky days imbued,

Honoured with mighty monarchsâ gratitude,

Brahmin, who stole your share of food away.â


6. âA student in the Vedic lore deep-read,

Let all men reverence his holy head,

And of the people be he worshipped,

Brahmin, who stole your share of food away.â


7. âBy Sakkaâs 
VÄsava.
 gift a village may he hold,

Rich, choice, possessed of all the goods fourfold, 
The commentator explains this as: populous, rich in grain, in wood, in water. This verse is said by the friendly ascetic.

And may he die with passions uncontrolled,

Brahmin, who stole your share of food away.â 
{4.310}


8. âA village chief, his comrades all around,

His joy in dances and sweet musicâs sound;

May the kingâs favour unto him abound:

Brahmin, who stole your share of food away.â 
Spoken by the slave man.


9. âMay she be fairest of all womankind,

May the high monarch of the whole world find

Her chief among ten thousand to his mind,

Brahmin, who stole your share of food away.â 
Spoken by [the sister] KaÃ±canÄ.


10. âWhen all the serving handmaidens do meet,

May she all unabashed sit in her seat,

Proud of her gains, and may her food be sweet.

Brahmin, who stole your share of food away.â 
Spoken by the slave girl.
 
[4.196]


11. âThe great KajaÃ±gal cloister be his care,

And may he set the ruins in repair,

And every day make a new window there,

Brahmin, who stole your share of food away.â 
Spoken by the Tree DevatÄ. KajaÃ±gala, the commentator informs us, was a town where materials were hard to be got. There in Buddha Kassapaâs time a god had a hard job of it repairing the ruins of an old monastery.


12. âFast in six hundred bonds may he be caught,

From the dear forest to a city brought,

Smitten with goads and guiding-pikes, distraught,

Brahmin, who stole your share of food away.â 
Spoken by the elephant.


13. âGarland on neck, tin earring in each ear,

Bound, let him walk the highway, much in fear,

And schooled with sticks to serpent kind 
The monkey says this: his task was to play with a snake. See above.
 draw near,

Brahmin, who stole your share of food away.â 
{4.312}

14. âWho swears the food was gone, if it was not,

Let him enjoy desire and its effect,

May worldly death be at the last his lot.

The same for you, sirs, if you now suspect.â

15. âWhat in the world men go seeking here

That thing to many lovely is and dear,

Longed-for, delightful in this life: why, then,

Have saints no praise for things desired of men?â

16. âDesires are deadly blows and chains to bind,

In these both misery and fear we find:

When tempted by desires imperial kings 
Lords of Beings, âan allusion to Sakkaâ 
(Commentator)
.


Infatuate do vile and sinful things.


17. These sinners bring forth wrong, to hell they go

At dissolution of this mortal frame. 
{4.313}

Because the misery of lust they know 
Snp 50.

Therefore saints praise not lust, but only blame.â 
[4.197]

18. âMyself to test these sages stole away

That food, which by the lake-side I did lay.

Sages they are indeed and pure and good.

O man of holy life, behold your food!â

19. âWe are no tumblers, to make sport for you,

No kinsmen nor no friends of thine are we.

Then why, O king divine, O thousand-eyed,

Think you the sages must your sport provide?â

20. âYou are my teacher, and my father thou,

From my offence let this protect me now.

Forgive me my one error, O wise sage!

They who are wise are never fierce in rage.â 
{4.314}

21. âHappy for holy men one night has been,

When the Lord VÄsava by us was seen.

And, sirs, be happy all in heart to see

The food once stolen now restored to me.â

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he said: âThus, monks, wise men of old made an oath and renounced wrong.â This said, he declared the Truths. At the conclusion of the Truths, the discontented monk was established in the fruit of the First Path. Identifying the JÄtaka, he recited three verses:

22. âSÄriputta, MoggallÄna, Puá¹á¹a, Kassapa, and I,

Anuruddha and Änanda then the seven brothers were.


23. Uppalavaá¹á¹Ä was the sister, and KhujjuttarÄ the maid,

SÄtÄgira was the spirit, Citta householder the slave,


24. The elephant was PÄrileyya, MadhuvÄseá¹­á¹­ha was the ape,

KÄá¸·udÄyi then was Sakka. Now you understand the JÄtaka.â

## Full Story
âI am.â
 
[4.198]
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling nearby SÄvatthi in the mansion of MigÄraâs mother, 
Her real name was VisÄkhÄ; she was the most distinguished among the female disciples of Buddha. See her history in Hardyâs 
Manual,
 220; Warren, Â§ 101. The reason for her title is given in Warren, 
Buddhism in Translations,
 p. 470, from the Dhp p. 245. See the story in 
MahÄvagga
, viii. 15.
 how she, VisÄkhÄ the great lay sister, received Eight Boons. One day she had heard the Dhamma preached in Jetavana, and returned home after inviting the Buddha with his followers for the next day. But late in that night a mighty tempest deluged the four continents of the world. 
{4.315}
 The Fortunate One addressed the monks as follows. âAs the rain falls in Jetavana, so, monks, falls the rain in the four continents of the world. Let yourselves be drenched to the skin: this is my last great world-storm!â So with the monks, whose bodies were already drenched, by his Supernormal Powers he disappeared from Jetavana, and appeared in a room of VisÄkhÄâs mansion. She cried, âA marvel indeed! A thing mysterious! O the miracle done by the power of the TathÄgata! With floods running knee deep, aye, with floods running waist-deep, not so much as the foot or the robe of a single monk will be wet!â In joy and delight she waited upon the Buddha and all his company. After the meal was done, she said to the Buddha, âVerily I crave boons at the hands of the Fortunate One.â âVisÄkhÄ, the TathÄgatas have boons beyond measure.â 
Or âare above granting boons (before they know what they are)â: so Rhys Davids and Oldenberg in 
MahÄvagga,
 i. 54. 4, viii. 15. 6.
 âBut such as are permitted, such as are blameless?â âSpeak on, VisÄkhÄ.â âI crave that all my life long I may have the right to give to the monks cloaks for the rainy season, food to all that come as guests, food to travelling monastics, food to the sick, food to those who wait on the sick, medicine to the sick, a continual distribution of rice gruel; and to the nuns all my life long robes for bathing in.â The Teacher replied, âWhat blessing have you in view, VisÄkhÄ, when you ask these eight boons of the TathÄgata?â She told him the benefit she hoped for, and he said: âIt is well, it is well, VisÄkhÄ, it is well indeed, VisÄkhÄ, that this is the benefit you hope for in asking the eight boons of the TathÄgata.â Then he said: âI grant you the eight boons, VisÄkhÄ.â Having granted her the eight boons and thanked her he departed.


One day when the Teacher was dwelling in the eastern park, they began to talk of it in the Dhamma Hall, âMonk, VisÄkhÄ the great lay sister, notwithstanding her womanhood, received eight boons at the One with Ten Powersâ hands. Ah, great are her virtues!â The Teacher came in and asked what they spoke of. They told him. Said he, âIt is not now the first time this woman has received boons from me, for she received such before,â and he told them a story.

1. âI am king Ruciâs consort-queen, the first he ever wed;

With Suruci ten thousand years my wedded life I led.


2. Suruci king of MithilÄ, Videhaâs chief place,

I never lightly held his wish, nor deemed him mean or base,

In deed or thought or word, behind his back, nor to his face. 
{4.320}


3. If this be true, O holy one, so may that son be given:

But if my lips are speaking lies, then burst my head in seven.


4. The parents of my husband dear, so long as they held sway,

And while they lived, would ever give me training in the way.


5. My passion was to hurt no life, and willingly do right:

I served them with extremest care unwearied day and night.


6. If this be true, O holy one, so may that son be given:

But if my lips are speaking lies, then burst my head in seven. 
[4.202]


7. No less than sixteen thousand dames my fellow-wives have been:

Yet, brahmin, never jealousy nor anger came between.


8. At their good fortune I rejoice; each one of them is dear;

My heart is soft to all these wives as though myself it were.


9. If this be true, O holy one, so may that son be given:

But if my lips are speaking lies, then burst my head in seven.


10. Slaves, messengers, and servants all, and all about the place,

I give them food, I treat them well, with cheerful pleasant face.


11. If this be true, O holy one, so may that son be given:

But if my lips are speaking lies, then burst my head in seven.


12. Ascetics, brahmins, any man who begging here is seen,

I comfort all with food and drink, my hands all washen clean.


13. If this be true, O holy one, so may that son be given:

But if my lips are speaking lies, then burst my head in seven.


14. The eighth of either fortnight, the fourteenth, fifteenth days,

And the especial fast I keep, I walk in holy ways. 
For the exact meaning of 
pÄá¹­ihÄriyapakkho
 see Childers, p. 618.


15. If this be true, O holy one, so may that son be given:

But if my lips are speaking lies, then burst my head in seven.â 
{4.321}

16. âAll these great virtues, glorious dame, O daughter of a king,

Are found in you, which of thyself, O lady, you do sing.


17. A warrior, born of noble blood, all glorious and wise,

Videhaâs righteous emperor, your son, shall soon arise.â

18. âUnkempt, with dust and dirt begrimed, high-poisÃ©d in the sky,

You speakest in a lovely voice that pricks me to the heart.


19. Are you a mighty god, O sage and dwell in heaven on high?

O tell me whence you comest here, O tell me who you are!â

20. âSakka the hundred-eyed you see, for so the gods me call

When they are wont to assemble in the heavenly judgement hall.


21. When women virtuous, wise, and good here in the world are found,

True wives, to husbandâs mother kind even as in duty bound, 
sassudevÄ-patibbatÄ.
 
SassudevÄ
 should be a separate word.


22. When such a woman wise of heart and good in deed they know,

To her, though woman, they divine, the gods themselves will go.


23. So lady, you, through worthy life, through store of good deeds done,

A princess born, all happiness the heart can wish, have won. 
[4.203]


24. So you do reap your deeds, princess, by glory on the earth,

And after in the world of gods a new and heavenly birth.


25. O wise, O blessed! So live on, preserve your conduct right:

Now I to heaven must return, delighted with your sight. 
{4.323}

â âTwas king PanÄda who this palace had, 
Cp. Thag p. 22. [The original translation had only the first line, here I include all the verses.]


A thousand bowshots high, in breadth sixteen.

A thousand bowshots high, in banners clad;

A hundred storeys, all of emerald green.


Six thousand men of music to and fro

In seven companies did dance withal:

As Bhaddaji has said, âtwas even so:

I, Sakka, was your slave, at beck and call.â.
 
[4.205]

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he said: âThus, monks, VisÄkhÄ has received a boon of me before,â and then he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time, Bhaddaji was MahÄpanÄda, VisÄkhÄ the lady SumedhÄ, Änanda was Vissakamma, and I myself was Sakka.â

## Full Story
âYou are content.â
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana, about five hundred lay brethren who were under the Uposatha precepts. At that time they say that the Teacher, seated upon the Buddhaâs glorious seat, in the Dhamma Hall, in the midst of folk of all the four kinds, 
Monks, nuns, lay men, lay women.
 looking around upon the gathering with a gentle heart, perceived that this day the teaching would turn on the tale of the lay brethren. 
See Story of the Present to no. 148.
 Then he addressed these, and said: âHave the lay brethren taken upon them the Uposatha precepts?â âYes, sir, they have,â was the answer. âIt was well done, this Uposatha celebration was the practice of wise men of old: the wise men of old, I say, kept the Uposatha celebration in order to subdue the defilements of passion and lust.â Then at their request he told a story of the past.

1. âYou are content with little, I am sure.

Do want no food, O flying pigeon, now?

Hunger and thirst why willingly endure?

Why take upon you, sir, the Uposatha vow?â

2. âOnce full of greediness my mate and I

Sported like lovers both about this spot.

Her a hawk pounced on, and away did fly:

So, torn from me, she whom I loved was not!


3. In various ways my cruel loss I know;

I feel a pang in everything I see;

So to Uposatha precepts for help I go,

That passion never may come back to me.â 
{4.330}

4. âTree-dweller, coiling, belly-crawling snake,

Armed with strong fangs and poison quick and sure,

Uposatha precepts why do you wish to take?

Why thirst and hunger willingly endure?â


5. âThe headmanâs bull, all full of strength and might,

With hump all quivering, beautiful and fair,

He trod on me â in anger I did bite:

Pierced with the pain he perished then and there. 
[4.209]


6. Out pour the village people every one,

Weeping and wailing for the sight they see.

Therefore to sabbath vow for help I run,

That passion never more come back to me.â


7. âCarrion to you is food both rich and rare,

Corpses on charnel ground that rotting lie.

Why does a jackal thirst and hunger bear?

Why take Uposatha precepts upon him, why?â


8. âI found an elephant, and liked the meat

So well, within his belly I did stay.

But the hot wind and the sunâs parching heat

Dried up the passage where I pushed my way.


9. All thin and yellow I became, my lord!

There was no path to go by, I must stay.

Then came a storm that vehemently poured,

Damping and softening that postern way.


10. Then to get out again not slow was I,

Like the Moon issuing from RÄhuâs jaws: 
A monster who was supposed to swallow the moon in eclipse.
 
{4.331}

So to Uposatha precepts for help I fly

That greed may keep far from me: thereâs the cause.â


11. âIt was your manner once to make a meal

Of ants upon the ant-heap, teacher bear:

Why willing now hunger and thirst to feel?

Why willing now Uposatha precepts to swear?â


12. âFrom greed exceeding scorned I my own home,

To MalatÄ I made all haste to flee.

Out from the village all the folk did come,

With bows and bludgeons they belaboured me.


13. With blood besmeared and with a broken head

Back to my dwelling I made haste to flee.

So to Uposatha precepts I now have fled

That greed may never more come nigh to me.â

14. âThat thing, sir, which you have a mind to learn

To our best knowledge we have told it now:

But we would ask a question in our turn:

Why you, O brahmin, take the Uposatha vow?â 
{4.332}

15. â âTwas a Paccekabuddha, who but came

And stayed a moment in my hut, and showed

My comings and my goings, name and fame,

My family, and all my future road.


16. Then eaten up by pride, I did not throw

Myself before his feet; I asked no more.

So to Uposatha precepts for help I go,

That pride may not come nigh me as of yore.â 
[4.210]

The Teacher, having ended this discourse, said: âThus, lay brethren, the Uposatha precepts were the custom of wise men of old, and must be kept now.â Then he identified the JÄtaka. âAt that time Anurudha was the pigeon, Kassapa was the bear, MoggallÄna the jackal, SÄriputta the snake, and I myself was the ascetic.â

âIf I being captured.â
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling in Jetavana, about a discontented monk. To this monk the Teacher said, 
{4.333}
 âIs it true, as I am told, that you are discontent?â âYes, sir, it is true.â âMonk,â said he, âwill not this lust for pleasure confound a man like you? The hurricane that overwhelms Mount Sineru is not put to the blush before a withered leaf. In days of yore this passion has confounded holy beings, who for seven thousand years held aloof from following the sensual desires that arise within.â With these words, he told a story of the past.

âThere he rises, king all-seeing,


Making all things bright with his golden light.

You I worship, glorious being,

Making all things bright with your golden light,

Keep me safe, I pray,

Through the coming day.


All saints, the righteous, wise in holy lore,

These do I honour, and their aid implore:

All honour to the wise, to wisdom honour be,

To freedom, and to all that freedom has made free.â

âThere he sets, the king all-seeing,


He that makes all bright with his golden light.

You I worship, glorious being,

Making all things bright with your golden light.

Through the night, as through the day,

Keep me safe, I pray.


All saints, the righteous, wise in holy lore,

These do I honour and their aid implore:

All honour to the wise, to wisdom honour be,

To freedom, and to all that freedom has made free.â

1. âIf I being captured wealth to you shall bring,

Then wound me not, but take me still alive.

I pray you, friend, conduct me to the king:

I think a most rich reward he will give.â

2. âI have not set this arrow to the bow,

To do you hurt, O peacock king, today:

I wish to cut the snare and let you go,

Then follow your own will, and fly away.â

3. âSeven years, O hunter, first you did pursue,

Enduring thirst and hunger night and day:

Now I am in the snare, what would you do?

Why wish to loose me, let me fly away?


4. Surely all living things are safe for thee:

Taking of life you have forsworn this day:

For I am in the snare, yet you would free,

Yet you would loose me, let me fly away.â 
{4.338}

5. âWhen a man swears to hurt no living thing:

When all that live, for him, from fear are free:

What blessing in the next birth will this bring?

O royal peacock, answer this for me! 
[4.214]


6. When all that live, for him, from fear are free,

When the man swears to hurt no living thing,

Even in the present world, well praised is he,

Him after death to heaven his worth will bring.


7. There are no gods, so many men do say:

The highest bliss this life alone can bring;

This yields the fruit of good or evil way;

And giving is declared a foolish thing.

So I snare birds, for holy men have said it:

Do not their words, I ask, deserve my credit?â

8. âAll clear to vision sun and moon both go

High in the sky along their shining way.

What do men call them in the world below?

Are they of this world or another, say!â 
{4.339}

9. âAll clear to vision sun and moon both go

High in the sky along their shining way.

They are no part of this our world below,

But of another: that is what men say.â

10. âThen they are wrong, they lie who such things say;

Without all cause, who say this world can bring

Alone the fruit of good or evil way,

Or who declare giving a foolish thing.â

11. âVerily this is true which you do say:

How can one say that gifts no fruit can bring?

That here one reaps the fruit of evil way

Or good; that giving is a foolish thing?


12. How shall I act, what do, what holy way

Am I to follow, peacock king, O tell!

What manner of ascetic virtue â say,

That I be saved from sinking into hell!â 
{4.340}

13. âThey on the earth, who hold the ascetic vows,

In yellow clad, not dwelling in a house,

Who go forth early for to get their food,

Not in the afternoon: 
This was strictly forbidden to the monks.
 these men are good. 
[4.215]


14. Visit in season such good men as these,

And question any one it shall you please:

They will explain the matter, for they know,

About the other world and this below.â

15. âLike as the serpent casts his withered skin,

A tree her dry leaves when the green begin:

So I renounce my hunterâs craft this day,

My hunterâs craft for ever cast away.â

16. âAll those my feathered fowl that I did bind,

Hundreds and hundreds, in my house confined,

Unto them all I give their life today,

And freedom: let them homewards fly away.â 
{4.342}

17. âThe hunter traversed all the forest land

To catch the lord of peacocks, snare in hand.

The glorious lord of peacocks he set free

From pain, as soon as he was caught, like me.â

Having ended this discourse, the Teacher declared the Truths. Now at the conclusion of the Truths, the discontented monk became an Arahat, then he identified the JÄtaka by saying: âAt that time I was the peacock king.â

## Full Story
âI wandered, searching far.â
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana, about two ancient elders.


MahÄkosala, they say, in giving his daughter to king BimbisÄra, 
See Vol. ii. pp. 164, 275.
 allotted her a village of KÄsi for dowry. 
{4.343}
 After AjÄtasattu had murdered his father, 
Pasenadi was MahÄkosalaâs son, AjÄtasattu killed his father BimbisÄra.
 king Pasenadi destroyed that village. In the battles betwixt them for it, victory at the first lay with AjÄtasattu. And the king of Kosala, having the worst, asked his councillors, âWhat can we devise to take AjÄtasattu?â They answered, âGreat king, the monks have great skill of magical charms. Send messengers to them, and get the opinion of the monks at the monastery.â This pleased the king. Accordingly, he caused men to be sent, bidding them go there, and hiding themselves, overhear what the monks should say.


Now at Jetavana are many kingâs officers who have renounced the world. Two among these, a pair of old elders, dwelt in a leaf hut on the outskirts of the monastery: the name of one of them was elder Dhanuggahatissa, of the other the elder Mantidatta. These had slept all the night through, and awoke at peep of day. The elder Dhanuggahatissa said, as he kindled the fire, âElder Datta, sir.â âWell, sir?â âAre you asleep?â âNo, I am not asleep: whatâs to do now?â âA born fool that king of Kosala is; all he knows is how to eat a mess of food.â âWhat do you mean, sir?â âHe lets himself be beaten by AjÄtasattu, who is no better than a worm in his own belly.â âWhat should he do, then?â âWhy, elder Datta, you know the order of battle is of three kinds: Wagon Battle, Wheel Battle, and Lotus Battle. 
See ii. 275, note 2, [which reads: These are technical terms in Sanskrit also (
padmavyÅ«ho
, 
Åakaá¹­a
Â°, 
cakra
Â°); see Manu 7. 188, 7. 187, and B. R. dict. 
s.v.
 The âwheelâ explains itself: the âwagonâ was a wedge-shaped phalanx; the âlotus,â as noted by BÃ¼hler (translation of Manu in 
Sacred Books of the East
 page 246), is âequally extended on all sides and perfectly circular, the centre being occupied by the king.â]
 It is the Wagon Battle he ought to use in order to catch AjÄtasattu. Let him post valiant men on his two flanks on the hill-top, and then show his main battle in front: once he gets in between, out with a shout and a leap, and they have him like a fish 
[4.217]
 in a lobster-pot. That is the way to catch him.â


Now all this the messengers heard; and then went back and told the king. He immediately set out with a great host, and took AjÄtasattu prisoner, and bound him in chains. After punishing him thus for some days, he released him, advising him not to do it again, and by way of consolation gave him his own daughter, the princess VajirÄ, in marriage, and finally dismissed him with great pomp.


There was much gossip about it among the monks indoors, âAjÄtasattu was caught by the king of Kosala, through following the directions of elder Dhanuggahatissa!â They talked of the same in the Dhamma Hall, and the Teacher entering, asked them what the talk was. They told him. Then he said: âThis is not the first time, monks, that Dhanuggahatissa has shown himself expert in strategy.â And he told them a story. 
{4.344}

1. âI wandered, searching far and wide the woods and hills around:

I wandered, searching for my kin: and lo, my kin are found!


2. Here are abundant roots and fruits, with plenteous store of food;

What lovely hills and pleasant rills! To dwell here will be good.


3. Here will I dwell with all my kin, not anxious, at my ease,

Having no trouble, fearing nought from any enemies.â 
One line occurs on p. 71, line 21, of the text (last couplet on p. 45, above).

4. âA foe is here! Some other where take refuge, go your ways:

Ever the choicest of the herd, O Carpenter, 
Sic
.
 he slays!â


5. âWho is that foe? Come tell me true, my kindred, so well met,

Who does destroy you? Though he has not quite destroyed you yet.â 
{4.345}


6. âA king of beasts! Striped up and down he is, with teeth to bite:

Ever the choicest of the herd he slays â a beast of might!â 
[4.218]


7. âAnd have our bodies lost their strength? Have we no tusks to show?

We shall oâercome him if we work together: only so.â


8. âSweet words to hear, O Carpenter, of which my heart is fain:

Let no boar flee! Or he shall be after the battle slain!â

9. âHave you abjured all killing? Have you sworn

Safety for every living creature born? 
These two lines are the same as the first half of a verse on p. 337.

Surely your teeth their wonted virtue lack.

You find a herd, and come a beggar back!â

10. âMy teeth no longer bite,

My strength exhausted quite:

Brother by brother all together stood:

Therefore I wander lonely in the wood. 
[4.219]


11. Once they would hurry-scurry all about

To find their holes, a panic-stricken rout.

But now they grunt in serried ranks compact:

Invincible, they stand and face me out. 
The same verse occurs in ii. 407 (translation p. 277). 
 
{4.347}


12. They all agree together now, a leader they have got;

When all agree they may hurt me: therefore I want them not.â

13. âAlone the hawk subdues the birds, alone

The Asuras are by Sakka overthrown:

And when a herd of beasts the mighty tiger sees,

Ever the best he picks, and kills them at his ease.â

14. âNo hawk, no tiger lord of beasts, not Sakka can command

A kindred host that tiger-like 
The text is uncertain. Doubtless it means the host is a match for the tiger.
 combine to make a stand.â

15. âThe little tiny feathered fowl in flocks and coveys fly,

In heaps together up they rise, together skim the sky.


16. Down stoops the hawk, and all alone, down on them as they play,

Harries and kills them at his will: that is your tigerâs way.â 
{4.348}

17. âThen he with cruel greedy eye, deeming these words were true,

Took heart, and with his fangs all bare leaped on the tuskÃ¨d crew.â

18. âUnited friends, like forest trees â it is a pleasant sight;

The boars united, at one charge the tiger killed outright.â

19. âThe brahmin and the tiger both thus did the boars destroy,

And roared a loud and echoing roar in their exceeding joy.â 
{4.350}

20. âThe boars beneath the wild fig tree the holy water poured,

Upon the Carpenter, and cried, you are our king and lord!â

When he had ended this discourse, the Teacher said: âNo, monks, this is not the first time that Dhanuggahatissa has shown himself clever in strategy, but he was the same before.â With these words, he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time Devadatta was the sham ascetic, Dhanuggahatissa Carpenterâs Boar, and I myself was the Tree DevatÄ.â

In the present some merchants after worshipping the Buddha go on a journey and find a magic tree which gives them all they could desire. The Buddha tells a similar story from the past, but there the merchants in their greed wanted to cut the tree down at the root, and the deity living there saw to it they were all destroyed.

## Full Story
âMerchants from many.â
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana, about some traders who lived in SÄvatthi. These, we hear, when going away bent on business, came with gifts to the Teacher, sheltering themselves in the Refuges and the Precepts. âSir,â they said, âif we return safe and sound, we will worship your feet.â


With five hundred cartloads of merchandise they set out, and came soon to a wild forest, where they could see no road. Astray, waterless and without food, they traversed the forest until, seeing a huge banyan tree which was haunted by NÄgas, they unyoked the carts and sat down beneath it. Looking upon its leaves, they saw them all glossy as though wet with water, and the branches seemed to be full of water, which made them think thus, âIt appears as though water were running through this tree. What if we cut a branch of it facing the east? We shall find something to drink.â 
{4.351}


After this, one climbed up the tree and cut off a branch: out gushed a stream of water thick as a palm-trunk, and in this they washed, of this they drank. Next they cut a branch on the southern side: out from it came all manner of choice food, and they ate of it. They then cut a branch on the west side of the tree: out sprang women fair and beauteously adorned, with whom they took their pleasure. Lastly, they cut one of the northern branches: from it fell the seven previous things, and they took them and filled the five hundred carts, and returned to SÄvatthi. There they caused the treasure to be carefully guarded.


Bearing in their hands garlands and perfumes and the like, they repaired to Jetavana and saluted the Teacher and paid worship to him, and then sat on one side. That day they listened to the preaching of the Dhamma; and the next, they brought a munificent present, and renounced the merit of the whole, saying: âThe merit of this gift, sir, we renounce in favour of a Tree DevatÄ who gave us the whole treasure.â The meal finished, the Teacher asked them, âWhat Tree DevatÄ do you give this merit to?â The merchants told the TathÄgata the manner how they had received the treasure by a banyan tree. Said the Teacher, âThis treasure you have received for your moderation, and because you have not given yourselves into the power of desire; but in former days men were immoderate, and were in the power of desire, and thereby they lost treasure and life both.â Then at their request he told them a story.
 [4.222]

1. âMerchants from many a kingdom came, and all together met,

Chose them a chief, and straight set out a treasure for to get.


2. To this parched forest, poor in food, their way the travellers made,

And spied a mighty banyan tree with cool and pleasant shade.


3. There underneath that shady tree those merchants all did sit,

And reasoned thus, with folly clothed and poverty of wit:


4. Full moist the tree is, and it seems as water there did flow:

âOne of the branches let us cut which to the eastwards grow.â


5. The branch was cut; then pure and clear the trickling waters flow:

The merchants washed, the merchants drank till they had drunk enow.


6. Again in poverty of wit, with folly clothed, they say:

âOne of the branches on the south come let us cut away.â 
{4.352}


7. This branch being cut, both rice and meat out in a stream it brings,

Thick porridge, ginger, lentil soup and many other things.


8. The merchants ate, the merchants drank, they took their fill of it,

Then said again, with folly clothed, in poverty of wit:


9. âCome, fellow-merchants, let us cut a western branch away.â

Out came a bevy of fair girls all pranked in brave array.


10. And O the robes of many hues, jewels and rings in plenty!

Each merchant had a pretty maid, each of the five and twenty.


11. These all together stood around beneath the leafy shade:

These and the merchants in the midst, much merriment they made.


12. Again in poverty of wit, with folly clothed, they say,

âOne of the branches on the north come let us cut away.â


13. But when the northern branch was cut, out came a stream of gold,

Silver in handfuls, precious rugs, and jewels manifold;


14. And robes of fine Benares cloth, and blankets thick and thin.

The merchants then to roll them up in bundles did begin.


15. Again they said in witlessness and folly, as before:

Câome let us cut it by the root, and then we may get more.â


16. O then uprose their chief, and said, with a respectful bow,

âWhat mischief does the banyan do, good sirs? God bless you now!


17. The eastern branch gave water-streams, the southern gave us food,

The western gave us pretty maids, the northern all things good:

What mischief does the banyan do, good sirs? God bless you now!


18. The tree that gives you pleasant shade, to sit or lie at need,

You should not tear its branches down, a cruel, wanton deed.â


19. But they were many, he was one whose voice forbade them doât:

They struck the whetted axes in to fell it by the root.â
 [4.223] {4.353}

20. âThen five and twenty mail-clad snakes stood forth and took the field,

Three hundred bowmen, and six thousand armed with sword and shield.â 
{4.354}

21. âStrike down the men, and bind them fast, spare not the life of one,

Burn them to cinders save the chief, and then your task is done.â

22. âSo let the wise his own good see, and let him never go

A slave to greed, that he disarm the purpose of his foe.


23. So let him, seeing this evil thing, pain rooted in desire,

Shake off desire and fetters, and to holy life aspire.â

Having ended this discourse, he said: âThus, monks, in days of yore merchants possessed with greed came to dire destruction, therefore you must not give place to greed.â Then having declared the Truths; and at the conclusion of the Truths those merchants became established in the fruit of the First Path, and he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time SÄriputta was the king of the Serpents, and I was the caravan chief.â

{4.355}
This story the Teacher told while dwelling in Jetavana, about lay brethren who took on the Uposatha precepts. On that occasion the Teacher said: âLay brethren, wise men of old, by virtue of their keeping the Uposatha precepts, went in the body to heaven, and there dwelt for a long time.â Then at their request, he told a story of the past.
 [4.224]

1. âA wonder in the world was seen, that made the hair uprise:

For great Videhaâs king is sent a chariot from the skies!â 
{4.356}

2. âThe Devaputta MÄtali, the charioteer, did bring

A summons to Vedeha, who in MithilÄ was king: 
[4.225]


3. âO mighty monarch, noble king, mount in this car with me,

Sakka would see you, and the gods, the glorious Thirty-Three,

And now they sit in a meeting all, bethinking them of you.â


4. Then king SÄdhÄ«na turned his face, and mounted in the car;

Which with its thousand steeds then bore him to the gods afar.


5. The gods beheld the king arrive, and then, their guest to greet

Cried, âWelcome mighty monarch, whom we are so glad to meet!

O king! Beside the king of gods we pray you take a seat.â


6. And Sakka welcomed Vedeha, the king of MithilÄ town,

Ay, VÄsava 
Another name of Indra.
 offered him all joys, and prayed him to sit down.


7. Amid the rulers of the world O welcome to our land:

âDwell with the gods, O king! Who have all wishes at command,

Enjoy immortal pleasures, where the Three-and-Thirty stand.â â 
{4.357}

8. âI joyed, when time to heaven I came,

In dances, song and music clear:

Now I no longer feel the same.

Is my life done, does death draw near,

Or is it folly, king, that I must fear?â

9. âYour lifeâs not done, and death is far,

Nor are you foolish, mighty one:

But your good deeds exhausted are

And now your merit is all done.


10. Still here abide, O mighty king, by my divine command;

Enjoy immortal pleasures, where the Three-and-Thirty stand.â 
The commentator explains: âI will give you the half of my merit, so remain here by my power.â
 
{4.358}

11. âAs when a chariot, or when goods are given on demand,

So is it to enjoy a bliss given by anotherâs hand.


12. I care not blessings to receive given by anotherâs hand,

My goods are mine and mine alone when on my deeds I stand.


13. Iâll go and do much good to men, give alms throughout the land,

Will follow virtue, exercise control and self-command:

He that so acts is happy, and fears no remorse at hand.â

14. âHere are the lands, the conduit round through which the waters go,

The green grass clothing it about, the rivulets that flow, 
{4.359}


15. The lovely lakes, that listen when the ruddy geese give call,

Where lotus white and lotus blue and trees like coral 
Erythrina indica.
 grow,

â But those who loved this place with me, O say, where are they all?


16. These are the acres, this the place,

The pleasure gardens and the fields are here:

But seeing no familiar face,

To me it seems a desert drear.â

17. âCelestial mansions I have seen, shining in every place,

The Thirty-Three I have seen, and their monarch, face to face.


18. Joys more than human I have felt, a heavenly home was mine,

With all that heart could wish, among the Thirty-Three divine.


19. This I have seen, and to do deeds of virtue I came down:

And I will live a holy life, I want no royal crown. 
{4.360}


20. The path that never leads to woe, the path the Buddhas show,

Upon that path I enter now by which the holy go.â

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he said: âSuch is the performance of the Uposatha precepts which it is duty to keep,â and declared the Truths; now at the conclusion of the Truths, some of the lay brethren entered on the fruition of the First Path, and some of the Second, and he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time Änanda was king NÄrada, Anuruddha was Sakka, and I myself was the king SÄdhÄ«na.â

## Full Story
âThe righteous king.â
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling in Jetavana, about a gift incomparable. This has been explained in the SucirajÄtaka [Ja 424] 
[Another name for the ÄdittajÄtaka. Cst reads: 
ÄdittajÄtake
. I include the story here, which comes from the commentary of the MahÄgovindasutta.]
 of the Eighth Book.

It seems at one time almsfood arose in due order for the Fortunate One in RÄjagaha, SÄvatthi, SÄketa, KosambÄ«, BÄrÄá¹asÄ«, and therein, some said: âHaving spent a hundred pieces, I will give a gift,â and having written it on a leaf, it was pinned to the door of the monastery. Others said: âI will give two hundred.â Others said: âI will give five hundred.â Others said: âI will give a thousand.â Others said: âI will give two thousand.â Others said: âI will give five, ten, twenty, fifty.â Others said: âI will give a hundred thousand.â Others said: âI will give two hundred thousand,â and having written it on a leaf, it was pinned to the door of the monastery. Receiving the opportunity while the Buddha was walking on a walk through the countryside, they said: âI will give a gift,â and after filling their carts, the countryfolk followed along.


They spoke like this, âAt that time the people of the country after filling the carts with salt, oil, rice and sweetmeats, followed along close behind the Fortunate One, saying: âIn due order wherever we can get an opportunity, there we will give them food,â and everything is to be understood as in the story in the Khandhakas of the Vinaya. Just so was the unmatched gift achieved.


Having walked on a walk through the countryside, at that time it seems the Fortunate One arrived at Jetavana, and the king invited him and gave a gift. On the second day the city folk gave a gift. But their gift was greater than the kingâs, and then next day his was greater than the city folks,â thus after a number of days had passed the king thought: âThese city folk day by day give exceedingly, if the lord of the earth, the king, is defeated by the gifts of the city folk, he will be blamed.â Then queen MallikÄ told a skilful means to him.


Having made a pavilion with beautiful boards in the royal courtyard, and covered it with blue lotuses, having arranged five hundred seats, and placed five hundred elephants in front of the seats, each elephant held a white parasol over each of the monks. And two by two on the side of the seats, adorned with all decorations, young noblewomen ground up the four kinds of incense. At the conclusion she placed a measure of incense in the middle, while the other noblewoman rolled it with the hand holding the blue lotuses. Thus each monk was surrounded by noblewomen, and other women, adorned with all decorations, who, having taken a fan, were fanning them, and others, who having taken a water strainer, strained the water, and others who took away the fallen water.


For the Fortunate One there were four invaluable things: a foot stand, a stool, a bolster, and a jewelled parasol, these were the four invaluable things.


The gifts for the last to come in the Saá¹gha were valued at a hundred thousand.

We learn that the king, while making this distribution of gifts, examined five hundred monks with the Teacher their chief, and gave to the most holy saints among them. Then they sat talking in the Dhamma Hall, and telling of his goodness thus, âMonk, the king, in giving the incomparable gift, gave it in a case of much merit.â The Teacher, entering, would know what they talked of sitting there: and they told him. Said he, âIt is no wonder, monks, 
{4.361}
 that the king of Kosala, being the follower of such as I am, gives with discrimination. Wise men of old, before the Buddha had arisen, even they gave with discrimination.â With these words, he told them a story.

1. âThe righteous king Yudhiá¹­á¹­hila once asked Vidhura wise: 
This line occurs in iii. 401 (p. 202 of the translation).

âVidhura, seek me brahmins good, in whom much wisdom lies:


2. Men free from deeds of evil lust, that they may eat my food;

So I would give, my friend, that I may reap a crop of good.â â


3. â âTis hard to find such holy men, such brahmins, wise and good,

Who keep them spotless from all lust, that they may eat your food.


4. Of brahmins, O most mighty king, ten several kinds are there:

Listen, while I distinguish them, and all these kinds declare.


5. Some carry sacks upon their backs, root-filled and fastened tight;

They gather healing herbs, they bathe, and magic spells recite.


6. These are physician-like, O king, and brahmins too they hight:

Such brahmins shall we seek for, now you know this kind aright?â 
{4.362}

7. âThese have no right to such a name, lost is their brahminhood,

Vidhura, find me other men who shall be wise and good,

So would I give, that I myself may reap a crop of good.â


9. âSome carry bells and go before, and as they go they ring,

A chariot they can drive with skill, and messages can bring:

12. Men free from deeds of evil lust, that they may eat my food;

So would I give, that I myself may reap a crop of good.â


13. âWith waterpot and crooked staff some run to meet the king,

Through all the towns and villages, and as they follow, sing â

In wood or town we never budge, until a gift you bring!


14. Like tax-men these importunate, and brahmins too they hight:

Such brahmins shall we seek for, now you know this kind aright?â

Covered with dust and dirt-begrimed as beggar-men they fare:

Such brahmins shall we seek for, now you know this kind aright?â

All these they make their traffic in, and many another thing.

30. âSome family priests fortunes tell, or geld and mark a beast for pay:

With proffered food the village folk invite them oft to stay.

There kine and bullocks, swine and goats are slaughtered many a day.

34. âSome brahmins, armed with sword and shield, with battle-axe in hand,

Ready to guide a caravan before the merchants stand.

Such brahmins shall we seek for, now you know this kind aright?â

42. âOthers for love of gold lie down beneath the royal bed,

At soma-sacrifice: the kings bathing above their head. 
After a soma offering, the custom was for a king to bathe on a gorgeous couch. A brahmin lay beneath, and the holy water, washing off the kingâs defilements, washed them on to the brahmin, who received the bed and all its ornaments as recompense for playing scapegoat. Fick,

Vidhura, find me other men who shall be wise and good,


45. Men free from deeds of evil lust, that they may eat my food;

{4.367}

46. âBut there are brahmins, too, my lord, men very wise and good,

Free from the deeds of evil lust, to eat your offered food.


47. One only meal of rice they eat: strong drink they never touch:

And now you know this kind aright, say shall we look for such?â

48. âVidhura, bring those brahmins here, so holy and so wise,

Invite them, O Vidhura, here, let no delay arise!â 
[4.231]

The Teacher, after finishing this discourse, said: âNo wonder, monks, that the king of Kosala being my follower, has given me the gift incomparable, for wise men of old when as yet there was no Buddha, did the same.â Then he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time Änanda was the king, and the wise Vidhura was I myself.â

In the present one lay man wishes to pay honour to the Dhamma, and the Buddha tells him give gifts to Elder Änanda. The latter though passes the gifts to Elder SÄriputta, who in turn passes them to the Buddha. The Buddha then tells a story of similar events in the past, where a king honoured a brahmin, he an ascetic, and he in turn a Paccekabuddha.


The Bodhisatta = the HimÄlayan ascetic (HimavantatÄpasa),

SÄriputta = the family priest (purohita),

Änanda = the king (of Kuru) (rÄjÄ),

the landlord = the same in the past (kuá¹­umbika).

## Full Story
âI saw one sitting.â
 
[4.232] {4.369}
 This story the Teacher told, while dwelling in Jetavana, about a certain landowner. He was a true and faithful believer, and showed honour continually to the TathÄgata and the Saá¹gha. One day these thoughts came to him. âI show honour constantly to the Buddha, that precious jewel, and the Saá¹gha, that precious jewel, by bestowing upon them delicate food and soft raiment. Now I should like to do honour to that precious jewel the Dhamma: but how is one to show honour to that?â So he took plenty of perfumed garlands and such like things, and proceeded to Jetavana, and greeting the Teacher, asked him this question, âMy desire is, sir, to show honour to the jewel of the Dhamma: how is a man to set about it?â


The Teacher replied, âIf your desire is to honour the jewel of the Dhamma, then show honour to Änanda, the Treasurer of the Dhamma.â âIt is well,â he said, and promised to do so. He invited the elder to visit him, and brought him next day to his house in great pomp and splendour; he placed the elder upon a magnificent seat, and worshipped him with perfumed garlands and so forth, gave him choice food of many kinds, presented cloth of great price sufficient for the three robes.


Thought the elder, âThis honour is done to the jewel of the Dhamma; it befits not me, but it befits the chief Captain of the Dhamma.â So the food placed in the bowl, and the cloths, he took to the monastery, and gave it to elder SÄriputta. He thought likewise, âThis honour is done to the jewel of the Dhamma; it befits simply and solely the Supreme Buddha, Lord of the Dhamma,â and he gave it to the One with Ten Powers. The Teacher, seeing no one above himself, partook of the food, accepted the cloth for robes.


The monks chatted about it in the Dhamma Hall, âMonks, so and so the landowner, meaning to show honour to the Dhamma, made a gift to elder Änanda, Treasurer of the Dhamma; he thought himself unworthy of it, and gave it to the Captain of the Dhamma; and he, thinking himself not worthy, to the TathÄgata. But the TathÄgata, seeing no one above himself, knew that he was worthy of it as Lord of the Dhamma, and ate of the food, and took that cloth for robes. Thus the gift of food has found its master, by going to him whose right it was.â The Teacher entering, asked them what they talked about as they sat there. They told him. âMonks,â said he, âthis is not the first time that food given has fallen to the lot of the worthy by successive steps; so it did long ago, before the Buddhaâs day.â With these words, he told them a story. 
{4.370}

1. âI saw one worthy of a throne, who from a kingdom came

To deserts bare from palaces, most delicate of frame.


2. On him in kindness I bestowed picked paddy-grains to eat,

A mess of rice all cooked so nice such as men pour on meat.


3. You took the food, and gave it to the brahmin, eating none:

With all due deference I ask, what is it you have done?â


4. âMy teacher, pastor, zealous he for duties great and small,

I ought to give the food to him, for he deserves it all.â


5. âBrahmin, whom even kings respect, say why did you not eat 
Gotama is here only the clan-name of the brahmin, 
vaá¸á¸haá¹
 is the right reading, 
boiled rice
.


The mess of rice, all cooked so nice, which men pour over meat.


6. You knew not the giftâs scope, but to the sage you past it on:

With all due deference I ask, what is it you have done?â 
[4.234]


7. âI keep a wife and family, in houses too I dwell,

I rule the passions of a king, my own indulge as well.


8. Unto a wise ascetic man long dwelling in the wood,

Old, practised in ascetic lore, I ought to give the food.â


9. âNow the thin sage I ask, whose skin shows all the veins beneath,

With nails grown long, and shaggy hair, and dirty head and teeth:


10. Have you no care for life, O lonely dweller in the wood?

How is this monk a better man to whom you gave the food?â


11. âWild bulbs and radishes I dig, catmint and herbs seek I,

Wild rice, black mustard shake or pick, and spread them out to dry,


12. Jujubes, herbs, honey, lotus-threads, myrobalan, scraps of meat,

This is my wealth, and these I take and make them fit to eat. 
{4.372}


13. I cook, he cooks not: I have wealth, he nothing: Iâm bound tight

To worldly things, but he is free: the food is his by right.â


14. âI ask to the monk, sitting there, with cravings all subdued;

â This mess of rice, all cooked and nice, which men pour on their food,


15. You took it, and with appetite eat it, and share with none;

With all due deference I ask, what is it you have done?â


16. âI cook not, nor I cause to cook, destroy nor have destroyed;

He knew I have no wealth, all defilements I do avoid.


17. The pot he carried in his right, and in his left the food,

Gave me the broth men pour on meat, the mess of rice so good;


18. They have possessions, they have wealth, to give their duty is:

Who asks a giver to partake, he surely a foe is.â 
{4.373}

19. âIt was a happy chance for me today that brought the king:

I never knew before how gifts abundant fruit would bring.


20. Kings in their kingdoms, brahmins in their work, are full of greed,

Sages in picking fruits and roots: but monks from wrong are freed.â

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he said: âIt is not the first time, monks, that food went to him who deserved it, for the same thing has happened before.â Then he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time, the landowner who did honour to the Dhamma was the landowner in the story, Änanda was the king, SÄriputta the family priest, and I myself was the ascetic who lived in the HimÄlayas.â

## Full Story
âWhence comest you.â
 
[4.235] {4.375}
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling in Jetavana, about the hereditary king Udena. At that time, the venerable Piá¹á¸olabhÄradvÄja going from Jetavana through the air, used generally to pass the heat of the day in king Udenaâs park at KosambÄ«. The elder, we are told, had in a former existence been king, and for a long time had enjoyed glory in that very park with his retinue. By virtue of the good then performed by him, he used to sit there in the heat of the day, enjoying the bliss of attainment which was its fruit.


One day he was in that place, and sitting under a SÄl tree in full flower, when Udena came into the park with a large number of followers. For seven days he had been drinking deep, and he wished to take his pleasure in the park. He lay down on the royal seat in the arms of one of his women, and being tired soon fell asleep. Then the women who sat singing around threw down their music instruments, and wandered about the pleasance gathering flowers and fruit. By and by they saw the elder, and came up, and saluting him sat down. The elder sat where he was and discoursed to them.


The other woman by shifting her arms awoke the king, who said: âWhere are those girls gone?â She replied, âThey are sitting in a ring round an ascetic.â The king grew angry, and went to the elder, abusing and reviling, âCome, Iâll have the fellow devoured by red ants!â So in a rage he caused a basket full of red ants to be broken over the elderâs body. But the elder rose up in the air, and admonished the king; then to Jetavana he went, and alighted at the gateway of the Perfumed Chamber. âWhence have you come?â asked the TathÄgata: and he told him the fact. âBhÄradvÄja,â said he, âthis is not the first time Udena has done this to an ascetic, but he did the same before.â Then at the elderâs request, he told a story of the past. 
{4.376}

1. âWhence comest you, in filthy garments dressed,

A creature vile and Yakkha-like, I vow,

A robe of refuse-rags across your breast,

Unworthy of a gift â say, who are thou?â

2. âThe food, O noble sir! Is ready set,

The people taste, and eat, and drink of it:

You know we live on what we chance to get;

Rise! Let the low-caste churl enjoy a bit.â 
[4.239]

3. âFor brahmins, for my blessing, by my hand

This food is got, the gift of faithful heart.

Away! What boots it in my sight to stand?

âTis not for such as you: vile wretch, depart!â 
{4.381}

4. âThey sow the seed on high ground and on low,

Hoping for fruit, and on the marshy plain:

In such a faith as this your gifts bestow;

Worthy recipients so you shall obtain.â

5. âI know the lands wherein I mean to sow,

The proper places in this world for seed,

Brahmins highborn, that holy scriptures know:

These are good ground and fertile fields indeed.â

6. âThe pride of birth, oâerweening self-conceit,

Drunkenness, hatred, ignorance, and greed â

Those in whose hearts these vices find their seat â

They all are bad and barren fields for seed.


7. The pride of birth oâerweening, self-conceit,

Drunkenness, hatred, ignorance, and greed â 
{4.382}

Those in whose hearts these vices find no seat,

They all are good and fertile fields for seed.â

8. âHo Bhaá¹á¸akucchi, UpajjhÄya ho!

And where is Upajotiya, I say?

Punish the fellow, kill the fellow, go â

And by the throat hale the vile churl away!â 
The last two lines occur on p. 205 (above, p. 128).

9. âRevile a sage! To swallow blazing fire as much avails,

Or bite hard iron, or dig down a mountain with your nails.â 
[4.240]

10. âSo spake the sage MÄtaá¹ga, champion of truth and right,

Then in the air he rose aloft before the brahminsâ sight.â

11. âOver the shoulder twisted stands his head;

See how he stretches out a helpless arm!

White are his eyes as though he were quite dead:

O who is it has wrought my son this harm?â 
{4.384}

12. âA ascetic came, in filthy garments dressed,

A creature vile and Yakkha-like to see,

With robe of refuse-rags across his breast:

The man who treated thus your son, is he.â

13. âIn what direction went the wise one hence?

O noble youths, pray answer me this thing!

Come let us make atonement for the offence,

Our son to life again that we may bring.â 
[4.241]

14. âThat wise one, up into the air rose he,

Like moon in mid-career the fifteenth day:

The sage, truth-consecrated, fair to see,

Towards the east moreover bent his way.â

15. âOver the shoulder twisted stands his head;

See how he stretches out a helpless arm!

White are his eyes, as though he were quite dead:

O who is it has wrought my son this harm?â

16. âYakkhas there are, whose might and power is great,

Who follow sages, beautiful to see:

They saw your son ill-minded, passionate,

And they have treated thus your son for thee.â


17. âThen it is Yakkhas who this thing have done:

Do not be angry, holy man, with me!

O monk! Full of love towards my son

Hither for refuge to your feet I flee!â


18. âThen let me tell you that my mind does hide

Nor then nor now a thought of enmity:

Your son, through fancied knowledge, drunk with pride,

Knows not the meaning of the Vedas three.â


19. âO brother! Verily a man may find

All in a trice his sense quite gone blind.

Forgive me my one error, O wise sage!

They who are wise are never fierce in rage.â 
These two lines occur above, p. 313 (p. 197 of this volume).
 
{4.386}

20. âThis fragment of my leavings take with you,

Let the poor fool Maá¹á¸avya eat a piece:

Your son shall be made whole, restored to you,

And so the Yakkhas shall their prey release.â 
[4.242]

21. âYou are a fool, Maá¹á¸avya, small of wit,

Not knowing when to do good deeds is fit:

You give to those whose sinfulness is great,

To evildoers and intemperate.


22. Garments of skin, a mass of shaggy hair,

Mouth like an ancient well with grass oâergrown,

And see what ragged clouts the creatures wear!

But fools are saved not by such things alone.


23. When passion, hate, and ignorance, afar from men are driven,

Give to such calm and holy men: much fruit for this is given.â

24. âSo the whole nation was destroyed of Mejjha, as they say,

For glorious MÄtaá¹gaâs death, the kingdom swept away.â 
{4.390}

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he said: âIt is not now the first time that Udena has abused ascetics, but he did the same before.â Then he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time, Udena was Maá¹á¸avya, and I myself was the wise MÄtaá¹ga.â

## Full Story
âEvery good deed.â
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling in Jetavana, about two fellow monastics of the venerable MahÄkassapa, who lived happily together. This pair, we are told, were most friendly, and had share for share in all things with the utmost fairness: even when they walked for alms, together they went out and together came in, nor could they endure to be apart.


In the Dhamma Hall sat the monks, praising their friendship, when the Teacher came in, and asked what they talked about as they sat there. They told him; and he replied, âTheir friendship in one existence, monks, is nothing to wonder at; for wise men of old kept friendliness unbroken throughout three or four different existences.â So saying, he told them a story.

1. âEvery good deed bears fruit or soon or late,

No deed without result, and nothing vain:

I see SambhÅ«ta mighty grown and great,

Thus do his virtues bear him fruit again.


2. Every good deed bears fruit or soon or late,

No deed without result, and nothing vain.

Who knows if Citta also may be great,

And like myself, his heart have brought him gain?â

3. âEvery good deed bears fruit or soon or late,

No deed without result, and nothing vain.

Behold, my lord, see Citta at your gate,

And like thyself, his heart has brought him gain.â

4. âThen are you Citta, or the tale did hear

From him, or did some other make you know?

Your hymn is very sweet: I have no fear;

A village and a bounty 
Lit. a hundred (pieces of money): or (with the commentator) âA hundred villages I do bestow.â
 I bestow.â 
{4.395}

5. âI am not Citta, but I heard the thing.

It was a sage laid on me this command â

Go and recite an answer to the king,

And be rewarded by his grateful hand.â

6. âCome, yoke the royal chariots, so finely wrought and made:

Gird up with girths the elephants, in necklets bright arrayed.


7. Beat drums for joy, and let the conch be blown,

Prepare the swiftest chariots I own:

For to that hermitage I will away,

To see the sage that sits within, this day.â

8. âA precious hymn it was I sang so sweet

While thronging multitudes around me pressed;

For now this holy sage I come to greet

And all is joy and gladness in my breast.â 
{4.396}

9. âAccept a seat, and for your feet fresh water, it is right

To offer gifts of food to guests, accept, as we invite.â

10. âLet them make glad the place where you shall dwell,

Let throngs of waiting women wait on thee;

O let me show you that I love you well,

And let us both kings here together be.â

11. âSeeing the fruit of evil deeds, O king,

Seeing what profit deeds of goodness bring,

I fain would exercise stern self-control,

Sons, wealth, and cattle cannot charm my soul.


12. Ten decades has this mortal life, which each to each succeed:

This limit reached, man withers fast like to a broken reed.


13. Then what is pleasure, what is love, wealth-hunting what to me?

What sons and daughters? Know, O king, from fetters I am free.


14. For this is true, I know it well â death will not pass me by:

And what is love, or what is wealth, when you must come to die? 
{4.397}


15. The lowest race that go upon two feet

Are the outcastes, meanest men on earth,

When all our deeds were ripe, as guerdon meet

We both as young outcastes had our birth.


16. Outcastes in Avanti land, deer by NeraÃ±jara,

Ospreys by the Nerbudda, now brahmin and khattiya.â 
{4.398}

17. âLife is but short, and death the end must be:

The aged have no hiding where to flee.

Then, O PaÃ±cÄla, what I bid you, do:

All deeds which grow to misery, eschew.


18. Life is but short, and death the end must be:

The aged have no hiding where to flee.

Then, O PaÃ±cÄla, what I bid you, do:

All deeds whose fruit is misery, eschew. 
[4.249]


19. Life is but short, and death the end must be:

The aged have no hiding where to flee.

Then, O PaÃ±cÄla, what I bid you, do:

All deeds that are with passion stained, eschew.


20. Life is but short, and death the end must be:

Old age will sap our strength, we cannot flee.

Then, O PaÃ±cÄla, what I bid you, do:

All deeds that lead to lowest hell, eschew.â 
{4.399}

21. âTrue is that word, O seer! Which you say,

You like a holy saint your words dictate:

But my desires are hard to cast away,

By such as I am; they are very great.


22. As elephants deep sunken in the mire

Cannot climb out, although they see the land:

So, sunken in the slough of strong desire

Upon monastic path I cannot stand.


23. As father or as mother would their son

Admonish, good and happy how to grow:

Admonish me how happiness is won,

And tell me by which way I ought to go.â

24. âO lord of men! You cannot cast away

These passions which are common to mankind:

Let not your people unjust taxes pay,

Equal and righteous ruling let them find.


25. Send messengers to north, south, east, and west

The brahmins and ascetics to invite:

Provide them food and drink, a place to rest,

Clothes, and all else that may be requisite. 
{4.400}


26. Give you the food and drink which satisfies

Sages and holy brahmins, full of faith:

Who gives and rules as well as in him lies

Will go to heaven all blameless after death.


27. But if, surrounded by your womankind

You feel your passion and desire too strong,

This verse of poetry then bear in mind

And sing it in the midst of all the throng:


28. No roof to shelter from the sky, amid the dogs he lay,

His mother nursed him as she walked: but heâs a king today.â

When the Teacher had ended his discourse, he said: âThus, monks, wise men of old continued firm friends through the course of three or four existences.â Then he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time Änanda was the wise SambhÅ«ta, and I myself was the wise Citta.â

## Analysis
In the present the king of Kosala gives an incomparable gift to the Buddha and the Saá¹gha. The Buddha tells a story of a king who was not content with giving material gifts but determined to give even of his own body. When Sakka came he asked for an eye, and he gave both his eyes, and later received divine eyes in return.


The Bodhisatta = king Sivi (SivirÄjÄ),

Änanda = (king) Siviâs physician (sÄ«vikavejja),

Anuruddha = (the King of the Devas) Sakka,

the Buddhaâs followers = the rest of the cast (sesaparisÄ).

 This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana, about the gift incomparable. The circumstances have been fully told in Book VIII under the SovÄ«rajÄtaka [Ja 424]. 
[Ja 424 
ÄdittajÄtaka
 is here called the SovÄ«ra Birth; at 
DasabrÄhmaá¹ajÄtaka
, Ja 495 it was called the Socira Birth. I include the story here.]

It seems at one time almsfood arose in due order for the Fortunate One in RÄjagaha, SÄvatthi, SÄketa, KosambÄ«, BÄrÄá¹asÄ«, and therein, some said: âHaving spent a hundred pieces, I will give a gift,â and having written it on a leaf, it was pinned to the door of the monastery. Others said: âI will give two hundred.â Others said: âI will give five hundred.â Others said: âI will give a thousand.â Others said: âI will give two thousand.â Others said: âI will give five, ten, twenty, fifty.â Others said: âI will give a hundred thousand.â Others said: âI will give two hundred thousand,â and having written it on a leaf, it was pinned to the door of the monastery. Receiving the opportunity while the Buddha was walking on a walk through the countryside, they said: âI will give a gift,â and after filling their carts, the countryfolk followed along.


They spoke like this, âAt that time the people of the country after filling the carts with salt, oil, rice and sweetmeats, followed along close behind the Fortunate One, saying: âIn due order wherever we can get an opportunity, there we will give them food,â and everything is to be understood as in the story in the Khandhakas of the Vinaya. Just so was the unmatched gift achieved.


Having walked on a walk through the countryside, at that time it seems the Fortunate One arrived at Jetavana, and the king invited him and gave a gift. On the second day the city folk gave a gift. But their gift was greater than the kingâs, and then next day his was greater than the city folks,â thus after a number of days had passed the king thought: âThese city folk day by day give exceedingly, if the lord of the earth, the king, is defeated by the gifts of the city folk, he will be blamed.â Then queen MallikÄ told a skilful means to him.


Having made a pavilion with beautiful boards in the royal courtyard, and covered it with blue lotuses, having arranged five hundred seats, and placed five hundred elephants in front of the seats, each elephant held a white parasol over each of the monks. And two by two on the side of the seats, adorned with all decorations, young noblewomen ground up the four kinds of incense. At the conclusion she placed a measure of incense in the middle, while the other noblewoman rolled it with the hand holding the blue lotuses. Thus each monk was surrounded by noblewomen, and other women, adorned with all decorations, who, having taken a fan, were fanning them, and others, who having taken a water strainer, strained the water, and others who took away the fallen water.


For the Fortunate One there were four invaluable things: a foot stand, a stool, a bolster, and a jewelled parasol, these were the four invaluable things.


The gifts for the last to come in the Saá¹gha were valued at a hundred thousand.

But here the king, on the seventh day, gave all the requisites and asked for thanks; but the Teacher went away without thanking him. After breakfast the king went to the monastery, and said: âWhy did you return no thanks, sir?â The Teacher said: âThe people were impure, your majesty.â He went on to declare the Dhamma, reciting the verse that begins,

âThe miserly go not to the world of the gods,

Fools surely do not praise giving,

But the wise one rejoices in giving,

And through that he is happy hereafter.â 
Dhp 177. [Only the first line is quoted in the text. I include a complete translation here.]

The king, pleased at heart, did reverence to the TathÄgata by presenting an outer robe of the Sivi country, worth a thousand pieces of money; then he returned to the city.


Next day they were talking of it in the Dhamma Hall, âSirs, the king of Kosala gave the gift incomparable: and, not content with that, when the One with Ten Powers had discoursed to him, the king gave him a Sivi garment worth a thousand pieces! How insatiate the king is in giving, sure enough!â The Teacher came in, and asked what they talked about as they sat there: they told him. He said: âMonks, things external are acceptable, true: but wise men of old, who gave gifts till all JambudÄ«pa rang again with the fame of it, each day distributing as much as six hundred thousand pieces, were unsatisfied with external gifts; and, remembering the proverb, âGive what is dear you will receive what is dear,â they even pulled out their eyes and gave to those that asked.â With these words, he told a story of the past.

âIf there be any human gift that I have never made,

Be it my eyes, Iâll give it now, all firm and unafraid.â

1. âTo ask an eye the old man comes from far, for I have none:

O give me one of yours, I pray, then we shall each have one.â

2. âWho taught you hitherward to wend your way,

O mendicant, and for an eye to pray?

The chief portion of a man is this,

And hard for men to part with, so they say.â

3. âSujampati among the gods, the same

Here among men called MaghavÄ by name, 
{4.404}

He taught me hitherward to wend my way,

Begging, and for an eye to urge my claim.


4. âTis the all-chief gift for which I pray. 
Vanibbako
 in line 3 seems to be written by dittography. Some genitive would be looked for, and FausbÃ¶llâs 
vanibbino
 may be right; the form occurs in iii. 312.4 (Pali).

Give me an eye! O do not say me nay!

Give me an eye, that chief gift of gifts,

So hard for men to part with, as they say!â


5. âThe wish that brought you hitherward, the wish that did arise

Within you, be that wish fulfilled. Here, brahmin, take my eyes.


6. One eye you did request of me: behold, I give you two!

Go with good sight, in all the peopleâs view;

So be your wish fulfilled and now come true.â

7. âO do not give thine eye, my lord; desert us not, O king!

Give money, pearls and coral give, and many a precious thing:


8. Give thoroughbreds caparisoned, forth be the chariots rolled,

O king, drive up the elephants all fine with cloth of gold: 
{4.405}


9. These give, O king! That we may all preserve you safe and sound,

Your faithful people, with our cars and chariots ranged around.â 
[4.253]

10. âThe soul which, having sworn to give, is then unfaithful found,

Puts his own neck within a snare low hidden on the ground.


11. The soul which, having sworn to give, is then unfaithful found,

More sinful is than wrong, and he to Yamaâs house 
The commentator explains this to mean hell.
 is bound.


12. Unasked give nothing; neither give the thing he asketh not,

This therefore which the brahmin asks, I give it on the spot.â

13. âLife, beauty, joy, or strength â what is the prize,

O king, which motive for your deed supplies?

Why should the king of Sivi-land supreme

For the next worldâs sake thus give up his eyes?â 
{4.406}

14. âIn giving thus, not glory is my goal,

Not sons, not wealth, or kingdoms to control:

This is the good old way of holy men;

Of giving gifts enamoured is my soul.â 
The commentator adds: âThe supreme Buddha, while explaining the 
CariyÄpiá¹­aka
 to Sariputta, Captain of the Dhamma, to make clear the saying that omniscience was dearer even than both eyes,â quoted two lines from the 
CariyÄpiá¹­aka,
 p. 78, 16-17, 
Na me dessÄ
 [

. i. B. Hornerâs translation: the two eyes were not disagreeable to me nor was myself disagreeable to me. Omniscience was dear to me, therefore I gave the eye(s).]

15. âA friend and comrade, SÄ«vaka, are you:

Do as I bid you â you have skill enow â

Take

 out my eyes, for this is my desire,

And in the beggarâs hands bestow them now.â

16. âSo Sivi spurred on SÄ«vaka, and he fulfilled his mind.

He drew the kingâs eyes out, and to the brahmin these consigned:

And now the brahmin had the eyes, and now the king was blind.â

17. âA few days past; the eyes began to heal, and sound to appear:

The fostering king of Sivi then sent for his charioteer. 
{4.409}


18. Prepare the chariot, charioteer; to me then make it known:

I go to park and wood and lake with lilies overgrown.


19. He sat him in a litter by the waterside, and here

Sujampati, the king of gods, great Sakka, did appear.â

20. âSakka, the king of gods, am I; to visit you I came:

Choose you a boon, O royal sage! Whateâer your wish may name.â

21. âWealth, strength, and treasure without end, these I have left behind:

O Sakka, death and nothing more I want: for I am blind.â

22. âO warrior, lord of biped kind, declare the thing thatâs true:

If you the truth declare, your eye shall be restored to you.â

23. âWhatever sort, whatever kind of suitor shall draw near,

Whoever comes to ask of me, he to my heart is dear:

If these my solemn words be true, now let my eye appear!â

24. âA brahmin came to visit me, one of my eyes to crave:

Unto that brahmin mendicant the pair of them I gave.


25. A greater joy and more delight that action did afford.

If these my solemn words be true, be the other eye restored!â

26. âO fostering king of Sivi land, these holy hymns of thine

Have gained for you as bounty free this pair of eyes divine.


27. Through rock and wall, oâer hill and dale, whatever bar may be,

A hundred leagues on every side those eyes of thine shall see.â

28. âWho, if heâs asked to give, would answer no,

Although it be his best and choicest prize?

People of Sivi thronged in concourse, ho!

Come hither, see the gift of God, my eyes! 
{4.412}


29. Through rock and wall, oâer hill and dale, whatever bar may be,

A hundred leagues on every side these eyes of mine can see.


30. Self-sacrifice in all men mortal living,

Of all things is most fine:

I sacrificed a mortal eye; and giving,

Received an eye divine.


31. See, people! See, give ere you eat, let others have a share.

This done with your best will and care,

Blameless to heaven you shall repair.â

When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he said: âThus monks, wise men of old gave to any chance comer, who was not content with outside gifts, even their own eyes, taken out of their head.â Then he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time Änanda was SÄ«vaka the physician, Anuruddha was Sakka, the Buddhaâs followers were the people, and I myself was king Sivi.â

âIn fear of death.â
 
{4.413}
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling in the Bamboo Grove, about the venerable Änanda, who made renunciation of his life. This renunciation will be described in Book XXI, under the Cullahaá¹sajÄtaka [Ja 533], the Subduing of DhanapÄla.

This was a story told by the Teacher, while dwelling in the Bamboo Grove, as to how the venerable Änanda renounced his life. For when archers were instigated to slay the TathÄgata, and the first one that was sent by Devadatta on this errand returned and said: âVenerable sir, I cannot deprive the Fortunate One of life: he is possessed of great Supernormal Powers,â Devadatta replied, âWell, sir, you need not slay the ascetic Gotama. I myself will deprive him of life.â And as the TathÄgata was walking in the shadow cast westward by the Vultureâs Peak, Devadatta climbed to the top of the mountain and hurled a mighty stone as if shot from a catapult, thinking: âWith this stone will I slay the ascetic Gotama,â but two mountain peaks meeting together intercepted the stone, and a splinter from it flew up and struck the Fortunate One on the foot and drew blood, and severe pains set in. JÄ«vaka, cutting open the TathÄgataâs foot with a knife, let out the bad blood and removed the proud flesh, and anointing the wound with medicine, healed it.


The Teacher moved about just as he did before, surrounded by his attendants, with all the great charm of a Buddha. So on seeing him Devadatta thought: âVerily no mortal beholding the excellent beauty of Gotamaâs person dare approach him, but the kingâs elephant NÄá¸·Ägiri is a fierce and savage animal and knows nothing of the virtues of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saá¹gha. He will bring about the destruction of the ascetic.â So he went and told the matter to the king. The king readily fell in with the suggestion, and, summoning his elephant-keeper, thus addressed him, âSir, tomorrow you are to make NÄá¸·Ägiri mad with drink, and at break of day to let him loose in the street where the ascetic Gotama walks.â And Devadatta asked the keeper how much arrack the elephant was wont to drink on ordinary days, and when he answered, âEight pots,â he said: âTomorrow give him sixteen pots to drink, and send him in the direction of the street frequented by the ascetic Gotama.â âVery good,â said the keeper. The king had a drum beaten throughout the city and proclaimed, âTomorrow NÄá¸·Ägiri will be maddened with strong drink and let loose in the city. The men of the city are to do all that they have to do in the early morning and after that no one is to venture out into the street.â


And Devadatta came down from the palace and went to the elephant stall and, addressing the keepers, said: âWe are able, I tell you, from a high position to degrade a man to a lowly one and to raise a man from a low position to a high one. If you are eager for honour, early tomorrow morning give NÄá¸·Ägiri sixteen pots of fiery liquor, and at the time when the ascetic Gotama comes that way, wound the elephant with spiked goads, and when in his fury he has broken down his stall, drive him in the direction of the street where Gotama is wont to walk, and so bring about the destruction of the ascetic.â They readily agreed to do so.


This rumour was noised abroad throughout the whole city. The lay disciples attached to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saá¹gha, on hearing it, drew near to the Teacher and said: âVenerable sir, Devadatta has conspired with the king and tomorrow he will have NÄá¸·Ägiri let loose in the street where you walk. Do not go into the city tomorrow for alms but remain here. We will provide food in the monastery for the monastics, with Buddha at their head.â The Teacher without directly saying: âI will not enter the city tomorrow for alms,â answered and said: âTomorrow I will work a miracle and tame NÄá¸·Ägiri and crush the heretics. And without going around for alms in RÄjagaha I will leave the city, attended by a company of the monks, and go straight to the Bamboo Grove, and the people of RÄjagaha shall repair there with many a bowl of food and tomorrow there shall be a meal provided in the refectory of the monastery.â In this way did the Teacher grant their request.


And on learning that the TathÄgata had acceded to their wishes, they set out from the city, carrying bowls of food, and saying: âWe will distribute our gifts in the monastery itself.â And the Teacher in the first watch taught the Dhamma, in the middle watch he solved hard questions, in the first part of the last watch he lay down lion-like on his right side, and the second part he spent in the Attainment of Fruition, in the third part, entering into a trance of deep pity for the sufferings of humanity, he contemplated all his kinsfolk that were ripe for conversion and seeing that as the result of his conquest of NÄá¸·Ägiri eighty-four thousand beings would be brought to a clear understanding of the Dhamma, at daybreak, after attending to his bodily necessities, he addressed Änanda and said: âÄnanda, today bid all the monks that are in the eighteen monasteries that are round about RÄjagaha to accompany me into the city.â The elder did so, and all the monks assembled at the Bamboo Grove.


The Teacher attended by a great company of monks entered RÄjagaha and the elephant-keepers proceeded according to their instructions and there was a great gathering of people. The believers thought: âToday there will be a mighty battle between the Buddha NÄga and this elephant NÄga of the brute world. We shall witness the defeat of NÄá¸·Ägiri by the incomparable skill of the Buddha,â and they climbed up and stood upon the upper storeys and roofs and house-tops. But the unbelieving heretics thought: âNÄá¸·Ägiri is a fierce, savage creature, and knows nothing of the merits of Buddhas and the like. Today he will crush the glorious form of the ascetic Gotama and bring about his death. Today we shall look upon the back of our enemy.â And they took their stand on upper storeys and other high places.


And the elephant, on seeing the Fortunate One approach him, terrified the people by demolishing the houses and raising his trunk he crushed the wagons into powder, and, with his ears and tail erect with excitement, he ran like some towering mountain in the direction of the Fortunate One. On seeing him the monks thus addressed the Fortunate One, âThis NÄá¸·Ägiri, venerable sir, a fierce and savage creature, and a slayer of men, is coming along this road. Of a truth he knows nothing of the merit of Buddhas and the like. Let the Fortunate One, the Auspicious One, withdraw.â âFear not, monks,â he said: âI am able to overcome NÄá¸·Ägiri.â Then the venerable SÄriputta prayed the Teacher, saying: âVenerable sir, when any service has to be rendered to a father, it is a burden laid on his eldest son. I will vanquish this creature.â Then the Teacher said: âSÄriputta, the power of a Buddha is one thing, that of his disciples is another,â and he rejected his offer, saying: âYou are to remain here.â This too was the prayer of the eighty chief elders for the most part, but he refused them all.


Then the venerable Änanda by reason of his strong affection for the Teacher was unable to acquiesce in this and cried, âLet this elephant kill me first,â and he stood before the Teacher, ready to sacrifice his life for the TathÄgata. So the Teacher said to him, âGo away, Änanda, do not stand in front of me.â The elder said: âVenerable sir, this elephant is fierce and savage, a slayer of men, like the flame at the beginning of a cycle. Let him first slay me and afterwards let him approach you.â And though he was spoken to for the third time, the elder remained in the same spot and did not retire. Then the Fortunate One by the exercise of his Supernormal Powers made him fall back and placed him in the midst of the monks.

When this venerable man had renounced his life for the Teacherâs sake, they gossiped about it in the Dhamma Hall, âSirs, the venerable Änanda, having attained to the analytic knowledges of the one still in training, renounced his life for the One with Ten Powers.â The Teacher came in, asking what they spoke of as they sat there. They told him. Said he, âMonks, this is not the first time he has laid down his life for my sake; he has done it before.â Then he told them a story.

1. âIn fear of death, O Cittaka, those herds of creatures flee:

Go you with them, and linger not, for they shall live with you.â

2. âNo, no, Rohanta, Iâll not go; my heart has drawn me near;

Iâm ready to lay down my life, I will not leave you here.â


3. âThen blind, with none to care for them, our parents 
The word âparentsâ is supplied by the commentator: it is âthoseâ in the text.
 both must die:

O go, and let them live with you: O do not linger nigh!â


4. âNo, no, Rohanta, Iâll not go; my heart has drawn me near;

Iâm ready to lay down my life, I will not leave you here.â
 {4.416}

5. âGo, timid doe, and run away; an iron snare holds me:

Go with the rest, and linger not, and they shall live with you.â

6. âNo, no, Rohanta, Iâll not go; my heart has drawn me near;

Iâm ready to lay down my life, I will not leave you here.â


7. âThen blind, with none to care for them, our parents both must die:

O go, and let them live with you: O do not linger nigh!â


8. âNo, no, Rohanta, Iâll not go; my heart has drawn me near;

Iâll lose my life, but never leave you snared and captured here.â

9. âThe furious hunter, arms in hand, see him approaching near!

And he will slay us here today with arrow or with spear.â 
{4.417}

10. âThe tender doe in panic fear a little way did fly,

Then did a thing most hard to do, for she returned to die.â

11. âWhat are these deer that wait upon the prisoner, though free,

Nor for the sake of very life will leave him here, and flee?â

12. âMy brother and my sister these, of one same mother born:

Nor for the sake of very life will leave me here forlorn.â

13. âGrown blind, with none to care for them, they both will perish so:

O grant you life to all the five, and let my brother go!â

14. âSo be it: see I now set free the parent-fostering deer:

His parents when they find him safe shall make a merry cheer.â 
[4.261]

15. âHunter, be happy now, and may your kindred happy be,

As I am happy to behold the mighty stag set free.â

16. âHow did you win your liberty when life was nearly done:

How did the hunter set you free from treacherous trap, my son?â 
[4.262]

17. âCittaka won me liberty with words that charmed the ear,

That touched the heart, that pierced the heart, words uttered sweet and clear.


18. SutanÄ won me liberty with words that charmed the ear,

That touched the heart, that pierced the heart, words uttered sweet and clear.
 {4.420}


19. The hunter gave me liberty, these charming words to hear,

That touched the heart, that pierced the heart, words uttered sweet and clear.â

20. âHe with his wife and family, O happy may they be,

As we are happy to behold Rohanta now set free!â

21. âCome tell me, hunter: do you say, âSee the deerâs hide I bringâ:

Or have you no deerâs hide to show because of any thing?â

22. âInto my hands the creature came, into my privy snare,

And was fast caught: but others, free, attended on him there.


23. Then pity made my flesh to creep, a pity strange and new.

If I should slay this deer (thought I) then I shall perish too.â


24. âWhat were these deer, O hunter, what their nature and their ways,

What colour theirs, what quality, to merit such high praise?â

25. âWith silvery horns and graceful shape, with hide and fell most bright,

Red slot, and shining brilliant eyes all lovely to the sight.â

26. âSuch is their nature and their ways, my lord, and such these deer:

They used to find their parents food: I could not fetch them here.â

âTo friends and courtiers, warrior king, do righteously; and so

By living according to Dhamma to heaven the king shall go.


In war and travel, warrior king, do righteously; and so

By living according to Dhamma to heaven the king shall go.


In town and village, warrior king, do righteously; and so

By living according to Dhamma to heaven the king shall go.


In every land and realm, O king, do righteously; and so

By living according to Dhamma to heaven the king shall go.


To brahmins and ascetics all, do righteously; and so

By living according to Dhamma to heaven the king shall go.


To beasts and birds, O warrior king, do righteously; and so

By living according to Dhamma to heaven the king shall go.


Do righteously, O warrior king; from this all blessings flow:

By living according to Dhamma to heaven the king shall go.


With watchful vigilance, O king, on paths of goodness go:

The brahmins, Sakka, and the gods have won their godhead so.


These are the maxims told of old: and following wisdomâs ways

The goddess of all happiness herself to heaven did raise.â

27. âA jewelled earring give I you, a hundred drachms of gold,

A lovely throne like flower of flax, with cushions laid fourfold, 
catussado
 is so explained by the commentator. On p. 309. 26 (=p. 195 note 2 above) he paraphrases it as ârich in four different thingsâ there specified. The word

 is derived by Childers from Skt. 
utsad
 and rendered âprotuberance.â It also may mean âsprinkledâ or âcoveredâ (Skt.

), iii. 512. 10, iv. 60. 6.


28. Two wives of equal rank and worth, a bull and kine five score,

See that you do no wrong, but by these support your family.â
 {4.423}

This discourse ended, the Teacher said: âThus, monks, long ago as now Änanda renounced life for my sake.â Then he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time, Channa was the huntsman and SÄriputta the king, the sister was queen KhemÄ; some of the kingâs family were the father and mother, Uppalavaá¹á¹Ä was SutanÄ, Änanda was Citta, the SÄkiya clan were the eighty thousand deer, and I was myself the royal stag Rohanta.â

âThere go the birds.â
 
[4.264]
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling in the Bamboo Grove, about elder Änandaâs renunciation of life. 
[Ja 533 Cullahaá¹sajÄtaka. I include the story here.]

This was a story told by the Teacher, while dwelling in the Bamboo Grove, as to how the venerable Änanda renounced his life. For when archers were instigated to slay the TathÄgata, and the first one that was sent by Devadatta on this errand returned and said: âVenerable sir, I cannot deprive the Fortunate One of life: he is possessed of great Supernormal Powers,â Devadatta replied, âWell, sir, you need not slay the ascetic Gotama. I myself will deprive him of life.â And as the TathÄgata was walking in the shadow cast westward by the Vultureâs Peak, Devadatta climbed to the top of the mountain and hurled a mighty stone as if shot from a catapult, thinking: âWith this stone will I slay the ascetic Gotama,â but two mountain peaks meeting together intercepted the stone, and a splinter from it flew up and struck the Fortunate One on the foot and drew blood, and severe pains set in. JÄ«vaka, cutting open the TathÄgataâs foot with a knife, let out the bad blood and removed the proud flesh, and anointing the wound with medicine, healed it.


The Teacher moved about just as he did before, surrounded by his attendants, with all the great charm of a Buddha. So on seeing him Devadatta thought: âVerily no mortal beholding the excellent beauty of Gotamaâs person dare approach him, but the kingâs elephant NÄá¸·Ägiri is a fierce and savage animal and knows nothing of the virtues of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saá¹gha. He will bring about the destruction of the ascetic.â So he went and told the matter to the king. The king readily fell in with the suggestion, and, summoning his elephant-keeper, thus addressed him, âSir, tomorrow you are to make NÄá¸·Ägiri mad with drink, and at break of day to let him loose in the street where the ascetic Gotama walks.â And Devadatta asked the keeper how much arrack the elephant was wont to drink on ordinary days, and when he answered, âEight pots,â he said: âTomorrow give him sixteen pots to drink, and send him in the direction of the street frequented by the ascetic Gotama.â âVery good,â said the keeper. The king had a drum beaten throughout the city and proclaimed, âTomorrow NÄá¸·Ägiri will be maddened with strong drink and let loose in the city. The men of the city are to do all that they have to do in the early morning and after that no one is to venture out into the street.â


And Devadatta came down from the palace and went to the elephant stall and, addressing the keepers, said: âWe are able, I tell you, from a high position to degrade a man to a lowly one and to raise a man from a low position to a high one. If you are eager for honour, early tomorrow morning give NÄá¸·Ägiri sixteen pots of fiery liquor, and at the time when the ascetic Gotama comes that way, wound the elephant with spiked goads, and when in his fury he has broken down his stall, drive him in the direction of the street where Gotama is wont to walk, and so bring about the destruction of the ascetic.â They readily agreed to do so.


This rumour was noised abroad throughout the whole city. The lay disciples attached to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saá¹gha, on hearing it, drew near to the Teacher and said: âVenerable sir, Devadatta has conspired with the king and tomorrow he will have NÄá¸·Ägiri let loose in the street where you walk. Do not go into the city tomorrow for alms but remain here. We will provide food in the monastery for the monastics, with Buddha at their head.â The Teacher without directly saying: âI will not enter the city tomorrow for alms,â answered and said: âTomorrow I will work a miracle and tame NÄá¸·Ägiri and crush the heretics. And without going around for alms in RÄjagaha I will leave the city, attended by a company of the monks, and go straight to the Bamboo Grove, and the people of RÄjagaha shall repair there with many a bowl of food and tomorrow there shall be a meal provided in the refectory of the monastery.â In this way did the Teacher grant their request.


And on learning that the TathÄgata had acceded to their wishes, they set out from the city, carrying bowls of food, and saying: âWe will distribute our gifts in the monastery itself.â And the Teacher in the first watch taught the Dhamma, in the middle watch he solved hard questions, in the first part of the last watch he lay down lion-like on his right side, and the second part he spent in the Attainment of Fruition, in the third part, entering into a trance of deep pity for the sufferings of humanity, he contemplated all his kinsfolk that were ripe for conversion and seeing that as the result of his conquest of NÄá¸·Ägiri eighty-four thousand beings would be brought to a clear understanding of the Dhamma, at daybreak, after attending to his bodily necessities, he addressed Änanda and said: âÄnanda, today bid all the monks that are in the eighteen monasteries that are round about RÄjagaha to accompany me into the city.â The elder did so, and all the monks assembled at the Bamboo Grove.


The Teacher attended by a great company of monks entered RÄjagaha and the elephant-keepers proceeded according to their instructions and there was a great gathering of people. The believers thought: âToday there will be a mighty battle between the Buddha NÄga and this elephant NÄga of the brute world. We shall witness the defeat of NÄá¸·Ägiri by the incomparable skill of the Buddha,â and they climbed up and stood upon the upper storeys and roofs and house-tops. But the unbelieving heretics thought: âNÄá¸·Ägiri is a fierce, savage creature, and knows nothing of the merits of Buddhas and the like. Today he will crush the glorious form of the ascetic Gotama and bring about his death. Today we shall look upon the back of our enemy.â And they took their stand on upper storeys and other high places.


And the elephant, on seeing the Fortunate One approach him, terrified the people by demolishing the houses and raising his trunk he crushed the wagons into powder, and, with his ears and tail erect with excitement, he ran like some towering mountain in the direction of the Fortunate One. On seeing him the monks thus addressed the Fortunate One, âThis NÄá¸·Ägiri, venerable sir, a fierce and savage creature, and a slayer of men, is coming along this road. Of a truth he knows nothing of the merit of Buddhas and the like. Let the Fortunate One, the Auspicious One, withdraw.â âFear not, monks,â he said: âI am able to overcome NÄá¸·Ägiri.â Then the venerable SÄriputta prayed the Teacher, saying: âVenerable sir, when any service has to be rendered to a father, it is a burden laid on his eldest son. I will vanquish this creature.â Then the Teacher said: âSÄriputta, the power of a Buddha is one thing, that of his disciples is another,â and he rejected his offer, saying: âYou are to remain here.â This too was the prayer of the eighty chief elders for the most part, but he refused them all.


Then the venerable Änanda by reason of his strong affection for the Teacher was unable to acquiesce in this and cried, âLet this elephant kill me first,â and he stood before the Teacher, ready to sacrifice his life for the TathÄgata. So the Teacher said to him, âGo away, Änanda, do not stand in front of me.â The elder said: âVenerable sir, this elephant is fierce and savage, a slayer of men, like the flame at the beginning of a cycle. Let him first slay me and afterwards let him approach you.â And though he was spoken to for the third time, the elder remained in the same spot and did not retire. Then the Fortunate One by the exercise of his Supernormal Powers made him fall back and placed him in the midst of the monks.

Then also the monks were talking in the Dhamma Hall about the elderâs good qualities, when the Teacher came in and asked them what they sat talking about there. He said: âThis is not the first time, monks, that Änanda has renounced his life for my sake, but he did the same before.â And then he told them a story.

1. âThere go the birds, the ruddy geese, all overcome with fear:

O golden-yellow Sumukha, depart! What want you here?


2. My kith and kin deserted me, away they all have flown,

Without a thought they fly away: why are you left alone?


3. Fly, noble bird! With prisoners no fellowship can be:

Sumukha, fly! Nor lose the chance while you may yet be free.â 
[4.265] {4.425}

4. âNo, Iâll not leave you, royal goose, when trouble draweth nigh:

But stay I will, and by your side will either live or die.â

5. âA noble heart, brave words are these, Sumukha, which you say:

âTwas but to put you to the test I bade you fly away.â

6. âThey foot it by unfooted ways, birds flying in the sky:

And did you not, O noble goose, afar the snare espy?â

7. âWhen life is coming to an end, and deathâs hour draws anigh,

Though you may close upon it come nor trap nor snare you spy.â 
This couplet occurs in ii. 52 (p. 35 of translation), and iii. 331 (p. 204, âWhen ruinâ¦â).
 
{4.426}

8. âThere go the birds, the ruddy geese, all overcome with fear:

And you, O golden-yellow fowl, are still left waiting here.


9. They ate and drank, the ruddy geese: uncaring, they are flown;

Away they scurry through the air, and you are left alone.


10. What is this fowl, that when the rest deserting him have flown,

Though free, you join the prisoner â why are you left alone?â

11. âHe is my comrade, friend, and king, dear as my life is he:

Forsake him â no, I never will, until death calls for me.â

12. âNow seeing that for friendshipâs sake you are prepared to die,

I set your king and comrade free, to follow where you fly.â

13. âWith all your kindred and your friends, O hunter, happy be, 
This line occurs in iii. 331 (p. 204 of translation, âO hunterâ¦â).

As I am happy to behold the king of birds set free.â

14. âNow has his honor, health and wealth, and is the kingdom full

Of welfare and prosperity, and does he justly rule?â 
{4.428}


15. âO here is health and wealth, O goose, and hereâs a kingdom full

Of welfare and prosperity, with just and righteous rule.â


16. âIs there no blemish seen amid your court, and are your foes

Far off; and like the shadow on the south, which never grows?â 
The last three words come from the commentatorâs note.


17. âThere is no blemish seen amid my courtiers, and my foes

Far off are like the shadow on the south, which never grows.â


18. âAnd is your queen of equal birth, obedient, sweet of speech,

Fruitful, fair, famous, waiting on your wishes, doing each?â


19. âO yes, my queenâs of equal birth, obedient, sweet of speech,

Fruitful, fair, famous, waiting on my wishes, doing each.â


20. âO fostering ruler! Have you sons a many, nobly bred,

Quickwitted, easy men to please whatever thing be sped?â
 [4.267]


21. âO Dhataraá¹­á¹­ha! Sons I have of fame, five score and one:

Tell them their duty: theyâll not leave your good advice undone.â

22. âHe that puts off until too late the effort to do good,

Though nobly bred, with virtue dowered, yet sinks beneath the flood. 
{4.429}


23. His knowledge fades, great loss is his; as one moonblind at night 
Nyctalops
.

Sees all things swollen twice their size with his imperfect sight.


24. Who sees the truth in falsity no wisdom gains at all,

As on a rugged mountain-path the deer will often fall.


25. If any strong courageous man loves virtue, follows right,

Though but a low-born churl, he burns like bonfires in the night.


26. By using this similitude all wisdomâs truths explain,

Cherish your sons till wise they grow, like seedlings in the rain.â
 {4.430}

After this discourse, the Teacher said: âThus, monks, this man offered his life for me before,â and then he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time Channa was the huntsman, SÄriputta the king, a sister was queen KhemÄ, the SÄkiya tribe was the flock of geese, Änanda was Sumukha, and I was the goose king myself.â

## Full Story
âWith a great host.â
 This story the Teacher told while sojourning in the deer-park Maddakucchi, about Devadatta. When Devadatta threw the stone, and a fragment pierced the Fortunate Oneâs foot, there was great pain because of it. Numbers of the monks gathered to see the TathÄgata. Now when the Fortunate One saw the people gathered together, he said to them, âMonks, this place is crowded: there will be a great gathering. Come now, carry me in 
[4.268]
 a litter to Maddakucchi.â So then the monks did. JÄ«vaka made the TathÄgataâs foot well. The monks sitting before the Teacher talked of it, âSirs, Devadatta is wicked and wicked are all his people; the wicked keeps company with the wicked.â The Teacher asked, âWhat do you talk of, monks?â They told him. Said he, âIt has been so before, and this is not the first time the wicked Devadatta has kept wicked company.â Then he told them a story.

1. âWith a great host PaÃ±cÄlaâs king went out to hunt the deer;

Deep in the woods the monarch strayed, and not a soul was near.


2. Lo, he beholds within the wood a shelter thieves had made,

Out came a Parrot and forthwith these cruel words he said:


3. âA young man riding in a car, with jewels many a one,

And on his brow a golden crown shines ruddy like the sun!


4. Both king and driver lie asleep there in the high midday:

Come, let us spoil them of their wealth and take it quick away!


5. âTis quiet as the deep midnight: both king and driver sleep:

Their wealth and jewels let us take and keep,

Kill them, and pile boughs on them in a heap.â â

6. âWhy, Sattigumba, are you mad? What words are these I hear?

Kings are like blazing bonfires, and most perilous to come near.â

7. âFoolâs talk, Patikolamba, this; and you are mad, not I:

My motherâs naked; why condemn the calling we live by?â 
âHe means the robber chiefâs wife, who went about clad in a garment of branches. âMy mother is nakedâ: why do you despise the robberâs trade?â â 
Commentator.
 The JuÄngs or Patuas in Orissa, or âleaf-wearers,â wear only a bunch of leaves tied before and behind.
 
{4.433}

8. âUp with you quick, friend charioteer, and yoke the chariot:

Seek we another shelter, since this parrot I like not.â

9. âThe car is yoked, O mighty king, is yoked and ready there:

Step in, O king! And let us go and seek shelter elsewhere.â

10. âNow where are all the fellows gone that used to haunt this spot?

Away PaÃ±cÄla flies, let go because they saw him not.


11. Shall he get clear away with life? Take javelin, spear, and bow:

Away PaÃ±cÄla flies, behold! O do not let him go!â
 [4.270]

12. âThe parrot with his ruddy beak right courteously did say,

Welcome, O king! A happy chance directed you this way!

Mighty you are and glorious: what errand brings you, pray?


13. The tindook and the piyal leaves, and kÄsumÄrÄ« sweet, 
Diospyros embryopteris
 and 
Buchanania latifolia
 are named.

Though few and little, take the best we have, O king, and eat.


14. And this cool water, from a cave high hidden on a hill,

O mighty monarch, take of it, drink if it be your will.


15. All gleaning in the wood are they who here are wont to live:

Arise, O king, thyself and take: I have no hands to give.â

16. âNo better fowl was ever hatched; a very righteous bird:

But the other parrot over there said many a cruel word.


17. O let him not go hence alive, O come and slay or bind!

He cried: I sought this hermitage, and safety here I find.â

18. âBrothers we are, O mighty king, of one self mother bred,

Reared both together in one tree, in different pastures fed.


19. Sattigumba to the thieves, I to the sages came;

Those bad, these good, and hence it comes our ways are not the same.â
 {4.435}

20. âThere wounds and bonds and trickery, cheating and shabby turns,

Raiding, and deeds of violence: such is the lore he learns.


21. Here self-control, sobriety, kindness, the right and true,

Shelter and drink for strangers: these were round me as I grew.â

22. âTo whomsoever, good or bad, a man shall honour pay,

Vicious or virtuous, that man holds him beneath his sway.


23. Like as the comrade one admires, like as the chosen friend,

Such will become the man who keeps beside him, in the end.


24. Friendship makes like, and touch by touch infects, youâll find it true:

Poison the arrow, and before long the quiverâs poisoned too.
 [4.271]


25. The wise eschews bad company, for fear of staining touch:

Wrap rotten fish in grass, youâll find the grass stinks just as much.

And they who keep foolâs company themselves will soon be such. 
{4.436}


26. Sweet frankincense wrap in a leaf, the leaf will smell as sweet.

So they themselves will soon grow wise, that sit at wise menâs feet.


27. By this similitude the wise should his own profit know,

Let him eschew bad company and with the righteous go:

Heaven waits the righteous, but the bad are doomed to hell below.â

When this lesson was ended, the Teacher said: âThus, monks, you see that Devadatta kept bad company before, as he now does.â Then he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time, Devadatta was Sattigumba, 
{4.437}
 his followers were the robbers, Änanda was the king, the Buddhaâs followers were the sages, and I myself was parrot Pupphaka.â

## Full Story
âWas a king BhallÄá¹­iya.â
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana about MallikÄ, the Jasmine Bride. 
The pretty story of king Pasenadi and this âbeggar-maidâ is told in Hardyâs 
Manual,
 p. 285. For this introduction cf. no. 306 in vol. iii. [
MallikÄ
 means 
jasmine
 in PÄá¸·i.]
 One day we are told there was a quarrel between her and the king about the bed. The king was angry and would not look at her. âI suppose,â she thought, âthe TathÄgata does not know that the king is angry with me.â When the Teacher learned of it, next day, he sought alms in Benares, accompanied by the monks, and then repaired to the gate of the kingâs palace. The king came to meet him, and relieved him of his bowl, took him up on the terrace, set the monks 
[4.272]
 down in due order, gave them the water of welcome, offered them excellent food; after the meal he sat down on one side. âWhy,â asked the Teacher, âdoes not MallikÄ appear?â He said: â âTis her own foolish pride in her prosperity.â The Teacher said: âO great king! Long, long ago when you were a Kinnara, you kept apart for one night from your mate, and then went mourning for seven hundred years.â Then at his request, he told a story of the past.

1. âWas a king BhallÄá¹­iyo

And out hunting he would go;

Climbs the Fragrant Mount, and finds it

Full of Kimpurisas and flowers that blow.


2. Straight he quiets every hound,

Lays bow and quiver on the ground,

Forward steps, to ask a question

Where a pair of Kimpurisas were found.


3. âWinterâs gone: then why return

To talk and talk beside the burn?

O you human-seeming creatures,

What men call you I would learn.â â
 [4.273]

4. âMalla, Three-peak, Yellow Hill 
The names given are Mallaá¹giri, TikÅ«á¹­a, Paá¹á¸araka.

We traverse, following each cool rill.
 {4.439}

Human-like the wild things deem us:

Huntsmen call us 
Reading 
ti
 for 
va
 with one MS.
 Kimpurisas still.â

5. âThough like lovers you caress

You weep as full of deep distress.

O you human-seeming creatures,

Why this weeping? Come, confess!


6. Though like lovers you caress

You weep as full of deep distress.

O you human-seeming creatures,

Why this sorrowing? Come, confess!


7. Though like lovers you caress

You weep as full of deep distress.

O you human-seeming creatures,

Why this mourning? Come, confess!â

8. âWe apart one night had lain,

Both loveless, full of bitter pain,

Thinking each of each: but never

Will that night come back again.â


9. âWhy then spend that night alone

Which cost you many a sigh and groan,
 {4.440}

O you human-seeing creatures â

Money lost? A father gone?â


10. âShaded thick that river flows

Between the rocks: a storm arose:

Then with anxious care to find me

Right across my loved one goes.


11. All the while with busy feet

I gathered thyme and meadowsweet 
The flowers given in the translation are not the same as those named in the text, which proudly defy English verse. Amongst them are: Alangium Hexapetalum, Gaertnera Racemosa, Cassia Fistula, Bignonia Suaveolens, Vitex Nigundo, Shorea Robusta.

All to make my love a garland

And myself, when we should meet.


12. Clustering harebell, violet blue,

And white narcissus fresh with dew,

All to make my love a garland

And myself, when we should meet.
 [4.274]


13. Then I plucked a bunch of rose,

That is the fairest flower that grows,

All to make my love a garland

And myself, when we should meet.


14. Flowers next and leaves I found,

And strewed them thickly on the ground,

Where the livelong night together

We might slumber soft and sound.


15. Sandal and sweet woods anon

I pounded small upon a stone,

Perfume for my loveâs limbs making,

Sweetest perfume for my own.


16. By the river flowing fast

I gathered lilies 
Pterospermum Acerifolium.
 to the last:
 {4.441}

Evening came â the river swelling

Made it hopeless to get past.


17. There we stood on either shore,

Each on other gazing oâer.

How we laughed and cried together!

Ah! That night we suffered sore.


18. Morning came, the sun was high

And soon we saw the river dry.

Then we crossed, and close embracing

Both at once we laugh and cry.


19. Seven hundred years but three

Since we were parted, I and he.

When two loving hearts are severed

Seems a whole long life to be.â


20. âWhat the limit of your years?

If this by rumour old appears.

Or the teaching of the elders,

Tell it me, and have no fears.â


21. âA thousand summers, strong and hale,

Never deadly pains assail,

Little sorrow, bliss abundant,

To the end loveâs joys prevail.â
 {4.442}

22. âThus instructed by the fays

The king returned upon his ways,

Ceased to hunt, and fed the needy,

And enjoyed the fleeting days.â

23. âTake a lesson from the fays:

And quarrel not, but mend your ways.

Lest you suffer, like Kimpurisas,

Your own error all your days.


24. Take a lesson from the fays:

And bicker not, but mend your ways.

Lest you suffer, like Kimpurisas,

Your own error all your days.â

25. âHoly man, with willing mind

I hear your words so good and kind.

Blessings on you! You have spoken,

All my sorrowâs left behind.â 
{4.444}

This discourse ended, the Teacher identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the king of Kosala was the Kinnara, lady MallikÄ was his mate, and I myself was king BhallÄá¹­iya.â

## Full Story
âWho does you harm.â
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana, about how Devadatta went about to slay him. Then the Teacher said: âThis is not the first time, monks, that Devadatta has sought to slay me, but he did the same thing before.â Then he told them a story.

1. âWho does you harm or scorn?

Why do you sorrow sore?

Whose parents now must mourn?

Who lies here on the floor?â

2. âYou I rejoice to see

O king, though absent long! 
{4.447}

Your son, who came to me,

Wrought unprovoked this wrong.â

3. âExecutioners, what ho!

Servants, take your swords and go,

Strike prince Somanassa dead,

Hither bring his noble head!â


4. The royal messengers went forth, and to the prince they cry â

âHis majesty has cast you off; and you O prince must die!â
 [4.278]


5. There the prince lamenting stands,

Craving grace with folded hands:

âSpare me yet awhile, and bring

Me alive to see the king!â


6. They heard his prayer, and to the king his son the servants led.

He saw his father from afar, and thus to him he said:


7. âLet your men take sword and slay,

Only hear me first, I pray!

O great monarch! Tell me this:

What is it Iâve done amiss?â
 {4.448}

8. âWater morn and eve he draws,

Tends the fire without a pause.

Dare you call this holy man

Worldling? Answer if you can!â

9. âHe possesses trees and fruits,

And, my lord, all kinds of roots,

Tends them with incessant care,

Then heâs worldly, I declare.â

10. âTrue it was that trees and roots

He possessed, with many fruits,

Tending with incessant care,

Worldling, as you did declare.â

11. âHear you people as I call,

Country folk and townsmen all:

By this foolâs advice the king

Guiltless men to death would bring.â 
[4.279]

12. âYou a strong wide spreading tree,

I an offshoot fixed in you,

Here beseech you, bending low,

Leave to quit the world and go!â 
{4.450}

13. âPrince, enjoy the wealth you own,

And ascend the Kuru throne.

Do not leave the world, to bring

Sorrow on yourself â be king!â


14. âWhat of joy can this world give?

When in heaven I used to live

There were sights and sounds and smell,

Taste and touch, 
passehi
 is probably for 
phassehi
 (objects of touch): 
rÅ«pa
 corresponds to the eye.
 the heart loves well!


15. Joys of heaven, AccharÄ divine,

I renounced, that once were mine.

With a king so weak as you

I will stay no longer now.â


16. âIf I am foolish-weak, my son,

This once forgive me what Iâve done.

And if I do the same again,

Do what you will, Iâll not complain.â

17. âA thoughtless act, or done without premeditation had,

Like the miscarriage of a drug, the issue must be bad.


18. A thoughtful act, wherein is careful policy pursued,

Like a successful medicine, the issue must be good.


19. The idle sensual layman I detest,

The false ascetic is a rogue contest;

A bad king will a case unheard decide;

Wrath in a sage can neâer be justified.


20. The warrior prince takes careful thought, and well-weighed judgement gives:

When kings their judgement ponder well, their fame for ever lives. 
These verses occur in Vol. iii. pp. 105 and 154 (translation, pp. 70, 103).


21. Kings should give punishment with careful measure:

Things done in haste they will repent at leisure.

Are there good resolutions in the heart,

No late repentance brings her bitter smart.


22. They who do deeds which no repentance bring,

Carefully weighing every single thing,

Gain what is good, and do what satisfies

The holy, win the approval of the wise.


23. What ho, my executioners! You cried,

Go seek my son, and where you find him, slay!

Where I was sitting by my motherâs side

They found me, dragged me cruelly away.
 [4.280]


24. A tender nursling, treated in this way,

I felt their cruel handling very sore.

Delivered from a cruel doom today

Iâll leave the world, and live in it no more.â 
{4.452}

25. âSo my young son, SudhammÄ, says me nay,

Prince Somanassa, delicate and kind.

Now since I cannot gain my end today,

Thyself must see if you can turn his mind.â

26. âO be the holy life your pleasure, son!

Renounce the world, to righteousness stick fast:

Who of all creatures cruel is to none,

Blameless to the Brahma Realm will come at last.â

27. âThis is a marvel which I hear from you,

Sorrow to sorrow heaping up on me. 
{4.453}

I asked you to persuade our son to stay,

You do but urge him more to haste away.â

28. âThere are who live from wrong and sorrow free,

Blameless, and who NibbÄnaâs height attain:

If of their noble path the prince would be

A partner, to withhold him is in vain.â

29. âSurely âtis good to venerate the wise,

In whom deep wisdom and high thoughts arise. 
These two lines occur in iii. 306 (translation, p. 191).

The queen has heard their words and learned their lore,

She feels no pain and has no longing more.â

This discourse ended, the Teacher said: âThus monks, he went about to slay me in former days, as now,â and then he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time Devadatta was the impostor, MahÄmÄyÄ was the mother, SÄriputta was Rakkhita, and I myself was prince Somanassa.â

âWho is it like.â
 
[4.281]
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling in Jetavana, about the Uposatha precepts. The Teacher said: âIt is well done, lay brethren, that you have taken upon you the Uposatha precepts. Wise men of old likewise even renounced the glory of being a NÄga king, and lived under these vows.â Then at their request he told a story of the past.

1. âWho is it like the lightning shines, or like a blazing star?

DevatÄ, GandhabbÄ«? I think no human thing you are.â

2. âNo DevÄ« I, nor GandhabbÄ«, nor human, mighty king

A female of the NÄga kind, come for a certain thing.â


3. âFull of wrath and rage you show,

From your eyes the teardrops flow:

Say what wrong or what desire

Brings you, lady? I would know.â


4. âCrawling serpent, fierce as flame!

So they called him: one there came,

Seized him for his profit, sire:

Freedom for my lord I claim!â


5. âHow could such a starveling wight

Catch a creature full of might?

Daughter of the NÄgas, say,

How to discern the NÄga right?â
 {4.460}


6. âSuch his might, that eâen this town

He could burn to cinders down.

But he loves the holy way,

And seeks austerityâs renown.â

Fourteenth and fifteenth are named.

At the four-ways used to take

Holy vows: a juggler caught him.

Free my husband for my sake!â

8. âLo sixteen thousand women adorned with jewel and ring,

Beneath the waters counted him their refuge and their king. 
[4.286]


9. Justly, gently set him free,

Buy the NÄga liberty,

With gold, a hundred kine, a village:

That will merit win for you.â 
{4.461}

10. âJustly now and gently see

I buy the NÄga liberty

With gold, a hundred kine, a village,

That will merit win for me.


11. A jewelled earring give I you, a hundred drachms of gold,

A lovely throne like flower of flax with cushions laid fourfold! 
This couplet, and half the next, occur above, p. 422.


12. A bull, a hundred kine, two wives of equal birth with you:

Release the holy NÄga: the deed will meritorious be.â

13. âI want no gifts, your majesty,

But let the NÄga now go free.

Thus I now release the NÄga:

The deed will meritorious be.â

14. âThe NÄga king Campeyyaka addressed the king, now free:

O king of KÄsi, fostering lord, all honour now to ye!

I do you reverence, ere I go again my home to see.


15. Superhuman beings may

Hardly win belief, they say.

If you speak the truth, O NÄga,

16. âShould the wind move mountains high,

Moon and sun fall from the sky,

Flow upstream the running rivers,

I, O king! Could never lie.

If you speak the truth, O NÄga!

Whereâs your palace? Show the way.â

19. âDeadly envenomed, full of might,

Quick in quarrel, shining bright,

You are freed by me from prison:

Then is gratitude my right.â

20. âHe that will no thanks return,

Happiness should never learn:

He should die in basket-prison,

He in horrid hell should burn!â

21. âAs that vow of thine is true,

Anger flee and hate eschew:

As we flee the fire in summer,

May the Supaá¹á¹a-birds flee from you!â 
âThe serpent tribeâ is the literal translation.

22. âAs a mother would have done

To an only well-loved son,

You are kind to all the NÄgas:

We will serve you, every one.â 
{4.464}

23. âYoke the royal cars, and stand

Trained Cambodian mules at hand,

Elephants in golden trappings:

Which like the brazen thunderbolt 
Bronze thunderbolts, shaped somewhat like those which Zeus grasps in Greek vase paintings, are still used in North India as charms.
 or ruddy sun did shine.


27. Into Campeyyaâs halls divine the king his entrance made:

A thousand perfumes scent the air, a thousand trees give shade.


28. Within Campeyyaâs palace once the king his step advanced,

Celestial harps made melody, fair NÄgakaÃ±Ã±Ä danced.
 {4.465}


29. He is shown a golden seat

Cushioned and with sandal sweet,

Where the bevy of fair maidens

Tread the halls with thronging feet.â

30. âThere the king in pleasure stayed.

To Campeyya then he said:

âGlorious mansions these of thine!

Ruddy like the sun they shine.

Such on earth are none to see:

Why would you an ascetic be?


31. Fair and fine these damsels stand,

Who with taper-fingers hold

Drink in either red-stained hand,

Breast and body girt with gold.

Such on earth are none to see:

Why would you an ascetic be? 
[4.289] {4.466}


32. River, fishpond, glassy-fair,

Each with well-built landing-stair,

Such on earth are none to see:

Why would you an ascetic be?

35. See the lakes! And wafted oâer

Scents divine on every shore:

Such on earth are none to see:

Why would you an ascetic be?â


36. âNot for life or sons or pelf

Do I wrestle with myself;

âTis my craving, if I can,

To be born again as man.â â

37. âBravely dressed, eyes red and bleared,

Broad-shouldered, shaven head, and beard,

Like Gandabbha-king addressing

All the world, with sandal smeared.


38. Great in might, in power divine,

Lord of all desires, incline,

NÄga-king, to rede my question:

How our world surpasses thine?â
 {4.467}

39. âComes control and cleansing when

One is in the world of men,

Only there: once man, Iâll never

See nor birth nor death again.â

40. âSurely âtis good to venerate the wise

In whom deep wisdom and high thoughts arise. 
See above, p. 280; and iii. 306 (translation, p. 190).

When you and all these maids I behold,

I will do virtuous actions manifold.â

41. âSurely âtis good to venerate the wise

In whom deep wisdom and high thoughts arise.

When me and all these maids you do behold,

Then do you virtuous actions manifold.â 
[4.290]

42. âI renounce it, gold untold,

Tree-high silver-heaps, behold!

Take and make you walls of silver,

Take and houses make of gold.

43. Pearls, five thousand loads, I ween,

Coral blushing in between,

Take and spread them in your palace

Till nor earth nor dirt be seen.


44. Such a mansion as I tell

Build, and there, O monarch! Dwell:

Rich will be Benares city:

Rule it wisely, rule it well.â

This discourse ended, the Teacher said: âThus wise men of old left the glories of the serpent world, to keep the Uposatha precepts.â Then he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time, Devadatta was the snake-charmer, RÄhulaâs mother was SumanÄ, Sariputta was Uggasena, and I was myself Campeyya king of the Snakes.â

âFrom Brahmaâs Realm.â
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling in Jetavana, about the defilement of the purified. The circumstances have already been given. Here again the Teacher said: âWomen cause defilement even in purified souls,â and then told this story of the past.
 [4.291] {4.469}

1. âFrom Brahmaâs Realm a Devaputta came upon this earth

As a kingâs son whose every wish was law, he had his birth.


2. To Brahmaâs Realm no deed of lust, no mention, ever came:

So born into this world, the prince now loathed its very name.


3. Within the palace he had made a closet all his own,

Where deep in meditation plunged he passed his days alone.


4. The king, grown anxious for his son, laments to know him there:

One only son I have, and he for pleasures will not care.â

5. âO who can tell me what to do! O is there no device?

Whoâll teach him joys of love to crave, and who can him entice?â

6. âA girl there was, of graceful shape, of fair and lovely skin:

She knew a world of pretty songs, and well could dance and spin.


7a. This maiden sought his majesty, and thus she did begin.â 
{4.470}

7b. âI will entice him, if you will in marriage grant him me.â

8. âDo but succeed in tempting him, your husband he shall be.â

9. âThe maiden went within the house, and where she stood apart,

Sang ditties sweet and languishing, to pierce a loverâs heart.


10. There as the maiden stood and sang, the prince, who heard the sound,

Straight fell in fancy, and he asked the servants waiting round:


11. âWhat is that sound of melody that comes to me so clear,

Piercing the heart with thoughts of love, delightful to my ear?â


12. âA maid, your majesty, fair to see, of dalliance infinite:

Would you enjoy the sweets of love, yield, yield to this delight.â


13. âHo, hither, nearer let her come, and let her sing yet more,

Here let her sing before my face within my closet door!â


14. She who had sung without the wall stood in the chamber there:

She caught him, as an elephant is caught in woodland snare.


15. He felt the joy of love, and lo! see jealousy full-grown:

âNo other man shall love! Cries he, but I will love alone!


16. No other man, but I alone!â He cries; and then away â

Seizes a sword, and runs amuck all other men to slay!
 {4.471}


17. The people shouting in alarm all to the palace fly:

âYour son is slaying every one all unprovoked!â they cry.


18. Him did the warrior king arrest, and banish from his face:

Within the boundaries of my realm you shall not find a place.


19. He took his wife and travelled on till by the sea he stood

There built a hut of leaves, and lived on gleanings from the wood.


20. A holy ascetic flying came over the ocean high,

He entered the hut at the time the meal was standing by.


21. The woman tempted him: now see how vile a thing was done!

He fell from chastity, and his Super Powers were gone!


22. The evening came; the prince returns, and from his gleaning brings

Hung to his pole a plenteous store of roots and wild-wood things.


23. The ascetic sees the prince approach: down to the shore goes he,

Thinking to travel through the air, but sinks into the sea!


24. But when the prince beheld the sage down-sinking in the sea,

Pity sprang up within him, and these verses then said he;


25. âHither not sailing on the sea, by Super Powers you came,

But now you sink; an evil wife has brought you to this shame.â 
These are the same as the first two verse, ii. 228 (translation).


26. Seducing traitresses, they tempt the holiest to his fall:

Down, down they sink: who women know should flee afar from all.


27. Soft-speaking, hard to satisfy, as rivers hard to fill;

Down, down they sink: who women know should flee far from them still.


28. And whomsoever they may serve for gold or for desire,

They burn him up, as fuel burns cast in a blazing fire. 
These are the same as the first six lines, ii. 226 (translation).


29. The ascetic heard the princeâs word; he loathed the world so vain:

Turned to his former path, 
That is, he returned to the path of holiness.
 and rose up in the air again. 
[4.293]


30. No sooner had the prince beheld how in the air he rose,

He grieved and with a purpose firm the holy life he chose;


31. Then, turned ascetic, wholly quelled his lust and hot desire;

And passion quelled, to the Brahma Realm henceforth he did aspire.
 {4.473}

This discourse ended, the Teacher said: âThus, monks, for womanâs sake even sanctified souls do wrong,â then he declared the Truths; now at the conclusion of the Truths, the discontented monk became an Arahat; after which he identified the JÄtaka, saying: âAt that time I myself was prince Anitthigandha.â

## Full Story
âAt last we see.â
 This story the Teacher told, while dwelling at Jetavana, about the Great Renunciation. 
[NidÄnakathÄ p. 61-65.]
 Then with these words, âIt is not the first time, monks, that the TathÄgata made the Renunciation, but it was so before,â the Teacher told them a story of the past.

1. âAt last we see a brahmin like a god, with top-knot great,

With teeth uncleansed, and foul with dust, and burdened with a weight. 
See 
Saá¹yuttanikÄya
, p. 1.


2. At last we see a sage, who takes delight in righteousness,

With robes of bark to cover him, and with the yellow dress.


3. Accept a seat, and for your feet fresh water; it is right

To offer gifts of food to guests â accept, as we invite.â
 {4.477}

4. âFirst learn the Vedas, get you wealth and wife

And sons, enjoy the pleasant things of life,

Smell, taste, and every sense: sweet is the wood

To live in then, and then the sage is good.â

5. âTruth comes not by the Vedas nor by gold;

Nor getting sons will keep from getting old; 
{4.478}

From sense there is release, as wise men know;

In the next birth we reap as now we sow.â 
[4.297]

6. âMost true the words that from your lips do go:

In the next birth we reap as now we sow,

Your parents now are old: but may they see

A hundred years of health in store for you.â

7. âHe who in death, O king, a friend can find,

And with old age a covenant hath signed;

For him that will not die be this your prayer,

A hundred years of life to be his share.


8. As one who on a river ferries oâer

A boat, and journeys to the other shore,

So mortals do inevitably tend

To sickness and old age, and deathâs the end.â
 {4.479}

9. âPleasures of sense are but morass and mire; 
This line occurs in iii. 241 (iii. 158 of the translation).

The heartâs delight brings death, and troubles sore.

Who sink in these morasses come no nigher

In witless madness to the further shore. 
NibbÄna.


10. Hereâs one who once inflicted grief and pain:

Now he is caught, and no release is found.

That he may never do such things again

Iâll build impenetrable walls around.

11. âLike one who seeks a cow has lost her way,

Who all perplexed about the wood does stray.

So is my welfare lost; then why hang back,

King EsukÄrÄ«, to pursue the track?â

12. âTomorrow! Cries the fool; Next day! He cries.

No freehold in the future! Says the wise;

The good within his reach heâll neâer despise.â 
{4.482}

13. âOft have I seen a maiden young and fair,

Bright-eyed, 
âWith eyes like the flower of Pandanus Odoratissimus.â
 intoxicate with life, her share

Of joy untasted yet, in youthâs first spring:

Death came and carried off the tender thing.


14. So noble, handsome lads, well-made and young,

Round whose dark chins the beard 
âBeard as it were covered with Carthamus Tinctorius.â
 in clusters clung â

I leave the world and all its sensual desires, to be

An ascetic: go you home, and pardon me.â
 {4.483}

15. âThat which has branching boughs a tree they call:

Disbranched, it is a trunk, no tree at all.

So is a sonless man, my high-born wife:

âTis time for me to embrace the holy life.â

16. âThe rain-months past, the geese break net and snare,

With a free flight like herons through the air; 
The commentator refers to a story describing how a spider in the rains wove a net that enclosed a flock of golden geese, how two of the younger birds at the end of the rains broke through by main force, and how the rest followed by the same gap and flew away.

So by the path of husband and of son

Iâll seek for knowledge as they two have done.

17. âThe birds that ate and vomited in the air are flying free:

But those which ate and kept it down are captured now by me. 
{4.486}


18. A brahmin vomits out his sensual desires, and will you eat the same

A man who eats a vomit, sire, deserves the deepest blame.â

19. âLike as a strong man lends a helping hand

To weaker, sunk in mire or in quicksand:

So, queen PaÃ±cÄtÄ«, you have saved me here,

With verses sung so sweetly in mine ear.â

20. âThus EsukÄrÄ«, mighty king, the lord of many lands,

From king turned ascetic, like an elephant that bursts his bands.â 
{4.487}

21. âIt is the pleasure of our noble king

To be an ascetic, leaving everything.

So in the kingâs place now we pray you stand;

Cherish the realm, protected by our hand.â 
[4.302]

22. âIt is the pleasure of the noble king

To be an ascetic, leaving everything.

Now know that I will walk the world alone,

Renouncing sensual desires and pleasures every one.


23. It is the pleasure of the noble king

To be an ascetic, leaving everything.

Now know that I will walk the world alone,

Whereâer they be, renouncing sensual desires each one.


24. Time passes on, night after night goes by, 
See 
Saá¹yuttanikÄya
, i. p. 3.

Youthâs beauties one by one must fade and die:

Now know that I will walk the world alone,

Renouncing sensual desires and pleasures every one.


25. Time passes on, night after night goes by,

Youthâs beauties one by one must fade and die:

Now know that I will walk the world alone,

Whereâer they be, renouncing sensual desires each one.


26. Time passes on, night after night goes by,

Youthâs beauties one by one must fade and die:

Now know that I will walk the world alone,

Each bond thrown off, nor passionâs power I own.â
 {4.488}

When he had ended this discourse, the Teacher said: âThus, monks, the TathÄgata made the Great Renunciation long ago, as now,â which said he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time, king Suddhodana was king EsukÄrÄ«, MahÄmÄyÄ his queen, Kassapa the family priest, BhaddakÄpilÄnÄ« his wife, Anuruddha was AjapÄla, MoggallÄna was GopÄla, SÄriputta was HatthipÄla, the Buddhaâs followers were the rest, and I myself was HatthipÄla.â

## Full Story
âLife once conceived.â
 This story the Teacher told about the Great Renunciation. Here again he said: âThis is not the first time, monks, that the TathÄgata has made the Great Renunciation, for he did the same before.â And he told them a story.

1. âLife once conceived within the womb, no sooner has begun,

Than on it goes continually, its course is never done. 
The commentator explaining this quotes the following lines: First seed, then embryo, then shapeless flesh, Then something solid, out of which soon grow Thighs, hair on head and body, with the nails: Whatever food or drink the mother takes, The baby lives on, in his motherâs womb.
 
[4.307]


2. No warlike prowess nor no mighty strength

Can keep men from old age and death at length;

All being plagued with birth and age I see:

So Iâm resolved â a holy life for me.


3. Great kings by force and violence subdue

Hosts of four arms, 
Horse, Foot, Chariots, Elephants.
 terrific to the view;

Over deathâs host they win no victory:

So Iâm resolved â a holy life for me.


4. Though horses, elephants, and cars, and men

Surround them, some have yet got free again;

But from the hands of death no man gets free:

So Iâm resolved â a holy life for me.


5. With horses, elephants, and cars, and men,

Heroes destroy and crush and crush again;

But to crush death no man so strong I see:

So Iâm resolved â a holy life for me.


6. Mad elephants in rut with oozing skin

Trample whole towns and slay the men within,

To trample death no one so strong I see:

So Iâm resolved â a holy life for me.


7. Archers who most strong-armed and skilful are,

Wound like a flash of lightning from afar,

But to wound death no man so strong I see:

So Iâm resolved â a holy life for me.


8. Great lakes, their woods and rocks, to ruin fall,

After a while ruin shall come to all,

In time all brought to nothing they shall be

So Iâm resolved â a holy life for me.


9. Like as a tree upon a river brink,

Or as a drunkard sells his coat for drink, 
The text is: âlike a drunkardâs cloth,â but this cryptic utterance is thus explained by the commentator.

Such is the life of those who mortals be:

So Iâm resolved â a holy life for me.
 {4.495}


10. The bodyâs elements dissolve â they fall

Young, old, the middle-aged, men, women â all,

Fall as the fruit falls from a shaken tree:

So Iâm resolved â a holy life for me.


11. Manâs prime is all unlike the queen whose reign

Rules oâer the stars: 
The Moon.
 it neâer will come again.

For worn-out eld what joy or love can be?

So Iâm resolved â a holy life for me.


12. While the Petas, PisÄcas and Yakkhas can

When angry breath their poison-breath on man,

âGainst death their poison-breath no help can be:

So Iâm resolved â a holy life for me.


13. While the Petas, PisÄcas and Yakkhas can

When angry, be appeased by deed of man,

Work it with death, no softening knows he:

So Iâm resolved â a holy life for me. 
[4.308]


14. Those who do crime, and wrong, and hurtful things,

When known, are punished by the act of kings,

But against death no punishment can be:

So Iâm resolved â a holy life for me.


15. Those who do crime, and wrong, and hurtful things

Can find a way to stay the hand of kings,

But how to stay deathâs hand no way can be:

So Iâm resolved â a holy life for me.


16. Warriors or brahmins, men of high estate,

Men of much wealth, the mighty and the great â

King Death no pity has, no ruth has he:

So Iâm resolved â a holy life for me.


17. Lions and tigers, panthers, seize their prey,

And all devour it, struggle as it may;

From fear of their devouring death is free:

So Iâm resolved â a holy life for me.


18. Upon the stage a juggler with his sleight

Performing can deceive the peopleâs sight,

To deceive death, no trick so quick can be:

So Iâm resolved â a holy life for me.
 {4.496}


19. Serpents enraged will with envenomed bite

Attack at once and kill a man outright;

For death no fear of poison-bite can be:

So Iâm resolved â a holy life for me.


20. Serpents enraged with venomed fangs may bite,

The skilful leech can stay the poisonâs might;

To cure deathâs bite no man so strong can be:

So Iâm resolved â a holy life for me.


21. Physiciansâ skill could cure the serpentâs bite;

Now they are dead themselves and out of sight,

Bhoga, Vetaraá¹Ä«, DhammantarÄ«

So Iâm resolved â a holy life for me.


22. Some who in spells and magic lore are wise

Can walk invisible to other eyes,

Yet not so invisible but death can see:

So Iâm resolved â a holy life for me.


23. Safe is the man who walks in righteousness;

Dispensation well observed has power to bless;

Happy the righteous man and never he

While he is righteous falls in misery. 
This verse is given in the Introduction
,
 p. 34. Also in Dhp p. 126, Thag 35.


24. Is it not true, his proper fruit from right or wrong shall spring?

Right leads to heaven, unrighteousness a man to hell must bring.â 
See Dhp p. 90 in FausbÃ¶llâs Commentary, 1. 3.
 {4.499}

This discourse ended, the Teacher said: âThus, monks, the TathÄgata has made the Great Renunciation before,â after which he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the kingâs parents were the mother and father, the Buddhaâs followers were their followers, and I was myself the Wise Ayoghara.â

## Full Story
âWhy do you.â
 
[5.1] {5.1}
 This story the Teacher told, while dwelling at Jetavana, about the observance of the Uposatha precepts. 
On the observance of 
poya (uposatha)
 days cf. Hardyâs 
Eastern Monachism,
 p. 237: âfastingâ includes doing no wrong to oneâs neighbour.


Now one day when a number of lay brethren and sisters, who were keeping the Uposatha, came to hear the Dhamma, and were seated in the Dhamma Hall, the Teacher asked them if they were keeping the Uposatha precepts, and on their saying that they were, he added, âAnd you do well to observe the Uposatha precepts: men of old, in consequence of keeping half the Uposatha, attained to great glory,â and at their request he told a tale of the past.

1. âWhy do you on this river bank through summer heat remain?

Brahmin, what is your secret hope? What purpose would you gain?â 
{5.4}

2. âAfloat upon the stream, fair nymph, a mango I did see;

With outstretched hand I seized the fruit and brought it home with me.


3. So sweet it was in taste and smell, I deemed it quite a prize;

Its comely shape might vie with biggest water-jar in size.


4. I hid it mid some plantain leaves, and sliced it with a knife;

A little served as food and drink to one of simple life.


5. My store is spent, my pangs appeased, but still I must regret,

In other fruits that I may find, no relish I can get.


6. I pine away; that mango sweet I rescued from the wave

Will bring about my death, I fear. No other fruit I crave.


7. Iâve told you why it is I fast, though dwelling by a stream

Whose broadening waves with every fish that swims are said to teem.


8. And now I pray you tell to me, and flee you not in fear,

O lovely maiden, who you are, and wherefore you are here.


9. Fair are the handmaids of the gods, like burnished gold are they,

Graceful as tiger brood along their mountain slopes that play.


10. Here also in the world of men are women fair to see,

But none amongst or gods or men may be compared to you.

I ask you then, O lovely nymph, endowed with heavenly grace,

Declare to me your name and kin and whence derived your race.â
 {5.5}

11. âOâer this fair stream, by which you sit, O brahmin, I preside,

And dwell in the great depths below, âneath Gangesâ rolling tide.


12. All clad with forest growth I own a thousand mountain caves,

Whence flow as many flooded streams to mingle with my waves.
 {5.6}


13. Each wood and grove, to NÄgas dear, sends forth full many a rill,

And yields its store of waters blue, my ample course to fill.


14. Oft borne upon these tribute streams are fruits from every tree,

Jambu plums, breadfruit, dates and figs, with mangoes one may see.


15. And all that grows on either bank and falls within my reach,

I claim as lawful prize, and none my title may impeach.


16. Well knowing this, hearken to me, O wise and learned king,

Cease to indulge your heartâs desire â renounce the cursed thing.
 [5.4]


17. O ruler fair of broad domains, your act I cannot praise,

To long for death, in prime of youth, great folly, sure, betrays.


18. Gandhabbas, Petas, Devas, men, all know your deed and name,

And saints who by their holiness attain on earth to fame â

Yea, all that wise and famous are, your sinful act proclaim.â
 {5.7}

19. âOne who knows how frail our life is, and how transient things of sense,

Never thinks to slay another, but abides in innocence.


20. Honoured once by saints in council, owner of a virtuous name,

Now with sinful men conversing, you do win an evil fame.


21. Were I on your banks to perish, nymph with comely form endowed,

Ill repute would rest upon you, like the shadow of a cloud.


22. Therefore, goddess fair, I pray you, every sinful deed eschew,

Lest, a bye-word of the people, you have cause my death to rue.â
 {5.8}

23. âWell I know the secret longing, thine to bear so patiently,

And I yield myself your servant and the mango give to thee.

Lo! Foregoing sinful pleasures, pleasures hard to be resigned,

You have gained, to keep for ever, holiness and peace of mind.


24. He that, freed from early bondage, hugs the chains he once forswore,

Rashly treading ways unholy, ever does wrong more and more.


25. I will grant your earnest craving, and will bid your troubles cease,

Guiding you to cool recesses, where you may abide in peace.


26. Herons, mynah birds and cuckoos, with the ruddy geese that love

Nectar from the bloom to gather, swans aloft in troops that move,

Paddy-birds and lordly peacocks, with their song awake the grove.


27. Saffron and kadamba blossoms lie as chaff upon the ground,

Ripest dates, the palms adorning, hang in clusters all around,

And, amidst the loaded branches, see how mangoes here abound!â
 {5.9}

28. âAll the night anointed, feted, with a crown upon your brow,

Neck and arms bedecked with jewels â all the day in anguish you!


29. Many thousand nymphs attend you. What a magic power is this!

How amazing thus to vary from a state of woe unto bliss!


30. What has led to your undoing? What the wrong that you do rue?

Why from thine own back do ever eat the flesh each day anew?â
 {5.10}

31. âOnce in holy lore delighting I in sensous toils was cast,

Working evil for my neighbour, through the lengthening years I passed.


32. He that shall, backbiting others, love on their good name to prey,

Flesh from his own back will ever rend and eat, as I today.â

The Teacher, having finished his lesson to the lay folk, revealed the Truths and identified the JÄtaka. At the conclusion of the Truths, some attained to the First Path, some to the Second, and others to the Third Path. âAt that time the DevadhÄ«tÄ was Uppalavaá¹á¹Ä, the ascetic was myself.â

## Full Story
âWho are you.â
 This story the Teacher, while dwelling at Jetavana, told concerning five hundred women, friends of VisÄkhÄ, who were drinkers of strong drink. Now the story goes that a drinking festival was proclaimed at SÄvatthi, and these five hundred women, after providing fiery drink for their masters, at the end of the festival thought: âWe too will keep the feast,â and they all went to VisÄkhÄ and said: âFriend, we will keep the feast.â She replied, âThis is a drinking festival. I will drink no strong drink.â They said: âDo you then give an offering to the supreme Buddha: we will keep the feast.â She readily assented and sent them away. And after entertaining the Teacher, and making him a large offering, set out at eventide for Jetavana, with many a scented wreath in her hand, to hear the preaching of the Dhamma, attended by these women. Now they were eager for drink, when they started with her, and, when they stood in the gabled chamber, they took strong drink, and then accompanied 
[5.6]
 VisÄkhÄ into the presence of the Teacher. VisÄkhÄ saluted the Teacher and sat respectfully on one side. Some of the other women danced before the Teacher; some sang; others made improper movements with their hands and feet; others quarrelled. The Teacher, in order to give them a shock, emitted a ray of light from his eyebrow; and this was followed by blinding darkness. These women were terrified and frightened with the fear of death, and so the effect of the strong drink wore off. The Teacher, disappearing from the throne on which he was seated, took his stand on the top of Mount Sineru, and emitted a ray of light from the hairs between his eyebrows, 
This manifestation is abundantly illustrated in Buddhist art, especially in that of the 
MahÄyÄna
 school.
 like as if it had been the rising of a thousand moons. The Teacher, just as he stood there, to produce a sensation amongst these women, spoke this verse:

âNo place 
Dhp 146.
 for laughter here, no room for joy,

The flames of passion suffering worlds destroy.

Why overwhelmed in darkest night, I pray,

Seek you no torch to light you on your way?â

At the end of the verse all the five hundred women were established in the fruition of the First Path. The Teacher came and sat down on the Buddha seat, in the shade of the Perfumed Chamber. Then VisÄkhÄ saluted him and asked, âVenerable sir, whence has arisen this drinking of strong drink, that does violence to a manâs honour and to a tender conscience?â And telling her he related a story of the past.
 {5.12}

1. âWho are you, Being from on high,

Whose form emits bright rays of light,

Like lightning flash across the sky,

Or moon illuming darkest night?


2. To ride the pathless air upon,

To move or stand in silent space â

Real is the power that you have won,

And proves you are of godlike race.


3. Then, brahmin, who you are declare,

And what within your jar may be, 
{5.15}

That thus appearing in mid air,

You fain would sell your wares to me.â

4. âThis jar nor oil nor ghee does hold,

No honey or molasses here,

But vices more than can be told

Are stored within its rounded sphere.


5. Who drinks will fall, poor silly fool,

Into some hole or pit impure,

Or headlong sink in loathsome pool

And eat what he would fain abjure.

Buy then, O king, this jar of mine,

Full to the brim with strongest wine.


6. Who drinks, with wits distracted quite,

Like grazing ox that loves to stray, 
{5.16}

Wanders in mind, a helpless wight,

And sings and dances all the day.

Buy then, O king, this jar of mine,

Full to the brim with strongest wine.


7. Who drinks will run all shamelessly,

Like nude ascetic through the town,

And late take rest â so dazed is he â

Forgetting when to lay him down.

Buy then, O king, this jar of mine,

Full to the brim with strongest wine.


8. Who drinks, like one moved with alarm,

Totters, as though he could not stand,

And trembling shakes his head and arm,

Like wooden puppet worked by hand.

Buy then, O king, this jar of mine,

Full to the brim with strongest wine.
 [5.9]


9. Who drink are burned to death in bed,

Or else a prey to jackals fall,

To bondage or to death are led,

And suffer loss of goods withal.

Buy then, O king, this jar of mine,

Full to the brim with strongest wine.


10. Who drinks is lost to decency

And talks of things that are obscene,

Will sit undressed in company,

Is sick and in all ways unclean.

Buy then, O king, this jar of mine,

Full to the brim with strongest wine.


11. Uplifted is the man that drinks,

His vision is by no means clear,

The world is all my own, he thinks,

I own no earthly lord as peer.

Buy then, O king, this jar of mine,

Full to the brim with strongest wine.


12. Wine is a thing of boastful pride,

An ugly, naked, cowardly imp,

To strife and calumny allied,

A home to shelter thief and pimp.

Buy then, O king, this jar of mine,

Full to the brim with strongest wine.


13. Though families may wealthy be,

And countless treasures may enjoy,

Holding earthâs richest gifts in fee,

This will their heritage destroy.

Buy then, O king, this jar of mine,

Full to the brim with strongest wine.


14. Silver and gold and household gear,

Oxen and fields and stores of grain â

All, all is lost: strong drink, I fear,

Has proved of wealthy home the bane.

Buy then, O king, this jar of mine,

Full to the brim with strongest wine.
 {5.17}


15. The man that drinks is filled with pride,

And his own parents will revile,

Or, ties of blood and kin defied,

Will dare the marriage bed defile.

Buy then, O king, this jar of mine,

Full to the brim with strongest wine.


16. She too that drinks will in her pride

Her husband and his sire revile,

And, dignity of race defied,

A slave to folly will beguile.

Buy then, O king, this jar of mine,

Full to the brim with strongest wine.


17. The man that drinks will dare to slay

A righteous monk or brahmin true,

And then in suffering worlds for aye

The sinful deed will have to rue.

Buy then, O king, this jar of mine,

Full to the brim with strongest wine.


18. Who drink do wrong in triple wise,

In word, in action, and in thought,

Then sink to hell, to agonize

For all the evil they have wrought.

Buy then, O king, this jar of mine,

Full to the brim with strongest wine.


19. The man from whom men beg in vain,

Even at cost of heaps of gold,

From him when drunk their point they gain

And readily the lie is told.

Buy then, O king, this jar of mine,

Full to the brim with strongest wine. 
[5.10]


20. Should one that drinks a message bear

And lo! some great emergency

Should suddenly arise, heâll swear

The thing has slipped his memory.

Buy then, O king, this jar of mine,

Full to the brim with strongest wine.


21. Eâen modest folk, intoxicate

With wine, will most indecent be,

And wisest men, when drunk, will prate

And babble very foolishly.

Buy then, O king, this jar of mine,

Full to the brim with strongest wine.


22. Through drink men, fasting, lie about,

The hard bare ground their resting place,

Huddled like swine, a shameless rout,

They undergo most foul disgrace.

Buy then, O king, this jar of mine,

Full to the brim with strongest wine.


23. Like oxen smitten to the ground

Collapsing, 
PattakkhandhÄ.
 cf. note on 
Cullavagga,
 iv. 4. 7, Translation by Davids and Oldenberg, p. 13.
 in a heap they lie; 
{5.18}

Such fire is in strong liquor found,

No power of man with it can vie.

Buy then, O king, this jar of mine,

Full to the brim with strongest wine.


24. When all men, as from deadly snake,

In terror from the poison shrink,

What hero bold enough to slake

His thirst from such a fatal drink?

Buy then, O king, this jar of mine,

Full to the brim with strongest wine.


25. âTwas after drinking this, I ween,

The Andhakas and Vï ªshá¹i race, 
See Wilsonâs 
Viá¹£á¹upurÄá¹a
 (Hallâs ed.), vol. v. pp. 147-149. cf. 
JÄtaka

Roaming along the shore, were seen

To fall, each by his kinsmanâs mace.

Buy then, O king, this jar of mine,

Full to the brim with strongest wine.


26. Devas infatuate with wine

Fell from eternal heaven, O king,

With all their magic power divine:

Then who would taste the accursed thing?


27. Nor curds nor honey sweet is here,

But evermore remembering

Whatâs stored within this rounded sphere,

Buy, pray you, buy my jar, O king.â
 {5.19}

28. âNo parents had I sage to teach, like you,

But you are kind and merciful, I see;

A seeker of the highest truth always;

Therefore I will obey your words these days.


29. Lo! Five choice villages I own are thine,

Twice fifty handmaids, seven hundred kine,

And these ten cars with steeds of purest blood,

For you have counselled me to mine own good.â 
[5.11]

30. âThese hundred slaves, O king, may still be thine,

And eke the villages and herds of kine;

No chariots yoked to high-bred steeds I claim;

Sakka, chief god of Thirty Three, my name.


31. Enjoy your ghee, rice, milk and sodden meat,

Still be content your honey cakes to eat.

Thus, king, delighting in the Truths Iâve preached,

Pursue your blameless path, till heaven is reached.â

The Teacher here ended his lesson and identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time Änanda was the king, and I myself was Sakka.â

## Full Story
âLo! After.â
 
{5.21}
 This story the Teacher told of a monk who supported his mother. The introductory story is like that told in the SÄmajÄtaka [Ja 540]. 
Vol. vi. No. 540. cf. also vol. iv. No. 510 
AyogharajÄtaka
.

They say that there was a wealthy merchant at SÄvatthi, who was worth eighteen crores; and he had a son who was very dear and winning to his father and mother. One day the youth went upon the terrace of the house, and opened a window and looked down on the street; and when he saw the great crowd going to Jetavana with perfumes and garlands in their hands to hear the Dhamma preached, he exclaimed that he would go too.


So having ordered perfumes and garlands to be brought, he went to the monastery, and having distributed robes, medicines, drinks, etc. to the assembly and honoured the Fortunate One with perfumes and garlands, he sat down on one side. After hearing the Dhamma, and perceiving the evil consequences of desire and the blessings arising from adopting the ascetic life, when the assembly broke up he asked the Fortunate One for ordination, but he was told that the TathÄgatas do not ordain anyone who has not obtained the permission of his parents; so he went away, and lived a week without food, and having at last obtained his parentsâ consent, he returned and begged for ordination. The Teacher sent a monk who ordained him; and after he was ordained he obtained great honour and gain; he won the favour of his teachers and preceptors, and having received full orders he mastered the Dhamma in five years.


Then he thought to himself, âI live here distracted â it is not suitable for me,â and he became anxious to reach the goal of spiritual insight; so having obtained instruction in meditation from his teacher, he departed to a frontier village and dwelt in the forest, and there having entered a course of insight, however much he laboured and strove for twelve years, he failed to attain any special insight.


His parents also, as time went on, became poor, for those who hired their land or carried on merchandise for them, finding out that there was no son or brother in the family to enforce the payment, seized what they could lay their hands upon and ran away as they pleased, and the servants and labourers in the house seized the gold and coin and made off therewith, so that at the end the two were reduced to an evil plight and had not even a jug for pouring water; and at last they sold their dwelling, and finding themselves homeless, and in extreme misery, they wandered begging for alms, clothed in rags and carrying potsherds in their hands.


Now at that time a monk came from Jetavana to the sonâs place of abode; he performed the duties of hospitality and, as he sat quietly, he first asked whence he was come; and learning that he was come from Jetavana he asked after the health of the Teacher and the principal disciples and then asked for news of his parents, âTell me, sir, about the welfare of such and such a merchantâs family in SÄvatthi.â âO friend, donât ask for news of that family.â âWhy not, sir?â âThey say that there was one son in that family, but he has become an ascetic in this dispensation, and since he left the world that family has gone to ruin; and at the present time the two old people are reduced to a most lamentable state and beg for alms.â


When he heard the otherâs words he could not remain unmoved, but began to weep with his eyes full of tears, and when the other asked him why he wept, âO sir,â he replied, âthey are my own father and mother, I am their son.â âO friend, your father and mother have come to ruin through you â do you go and take care of them.â âFor twelve years,â he thought to himself, âI have laboured and striven but never been able to attain the Path or the Fruit: I must be incompetent; what have I to do with the ascetic life? I will become a householder and will support my parents and give away my wealth, and will thus eventually become destined for heaven.â


So having determined he gave up his abode in the forest to the elder, and the next day departed and by successive stages reached the monastery at the back of Jetavana which is not far from SÄvatthi. There he found two roads, one leading to Jetavana, the other to SÄvatthi. As he stood there, he thought: âShall I see my parents first or the One with Ten Powers?â Then he said to himself, âIn old days I saw my parents for a long time, from henceforth I shall rarely have the chance of seeing the Buddha; I will see the Fully Awakened One today and hear the Dhamma, and then tomorrow morning I will see my parents.â So he left the road to SÄvatthi and in the evening arrived at Jetavana.


Now that very day at daybreak, the Teacher, as he looked upon the world, had seen the potentialities of this young man, and when he came to visit him he praised the virtues of parents in the MÄtiposakasutta [SN 7.19]. As he stood at the end of the assembly of elders and listened, he thought: âIf I become a householder I can support my parents; but the Teacher also says, âA son who has become an ascetic can be helpful,â I went away before without seeing the Teacher, and I failed in such an imperfect ordination; I will now support my parents while still remaining an ascetic without becoming a householder.â So he took his ticket and his ticket-food and gruel, and felt as if he had committed a wrong deserving expulsion after a solitary abode of twelve years in the forest. In the morning he went to SÄvatthi and he thought to himself, âShall I first get the gruel or see my parents?â He reflected that it would not be right to visit them in their poverty empty-handed; so he first got the gruel and then went to the door of their old house.


When he saw them sitting by the opposite wall after having gone their round for the alms given in broth, he stood not far from them in a sudden burst of sorrow with his eyes full of tears. They saw him but knew him not; then his mother, thinking that it was someone standing for alms, said to him, âWe have nothing fit to be given to you, be pleased to pass on.â When he heard her, he repressed the grief which filled his heart and remained still standing as before with his eyes full of tears, and when he was addressed a second and a third time he still continued standing.


At last the father said to the mother, âGo to him; can this be your son?â She rose and went to him and, recognising him, fell at his feet and lamented, and the father also joined his lamentations, and there was a loud outburst of sorrow. To see his parents he could not control himself, but burst into tears; then, after yielding to his feelings, he said: âDo not grieve, I will support you,â so having comforted them and made them drink some gruel, and sit down on one side, he went again and begged for some food and gave it to them, and then went and asked for alms for himself, and having finished his meal, took up his abode at a short distance off.


From that day forward he watched over his parents in this manner; he gave them all the alms he received for himself, even those at the fortnightly distributions, and he went on separate expeditions for his own alms, and ate them; and whatever food he received as provision for the rainy season he gave to them, while he took their worn-out garments and dyed them with the doors fast closed and used them himself; but the days were few when he gained alms and there were many when he failed to win anything, and his inner and outer clothing became very rough.


As he watched over his parents he gradually grew very pale and thin and his friends and intimates said to him, âYour complexion used to be bright, but now you have become very pale â has some illness come upon you?â He replied, âNo illness has come upon me, but a hindrance has befallen me,â and he told them the history. âSir,â they replied, âthe Teacher does not allow us to waste the offerings of the faithful, you do an unlawful act in giving to laymen the offerings of the faithful.â When he heard this he shrank away ashamed.


But not satisfied with this they went and told it to the Teacher, saying: âSo and so, sir, has wasted the offerings of the faithful and used them to feed laymen.â The Teacher sent for the young man of family and said to him, âIs it true that you, an ascetic, take the offerings of the faithful and support laymen with them?â He confessed that it was true. Then the Teacher, wishing to praise what he had done and to declare an old action of his own, said: âWhen you support laymen whom do you support?â âMy parents,â he answered. Then the Teacher, wishing to encourage him still more said: âWell done, well done,â three times, âYou are in a path which I have traversed before you: I in old time, while going the round for alms, supported my parents.â The ascetic was encouraged thereby.

But on this occasion the Teacher said: âSages of old gave up the white umbrella with its golden wreath to support their parents,â and with these words he told a story of the past.

1. âLo! After my long seven daysâ fast

A mighty prey appears at last!

Pray tell me, are you known to fame?

I fain would hear your race and name.â

2. âJayaddisa, if known to you,

PaÃ±cÄlaâs king I claim to be:

Hunting through fen and wood I stray:

Eat you this deer; free me, I pray.â 
{5.24}

3. âTo save your skin, you offer me this food

This quarry, king, to which my claim is good:

Know I will eat you first, and yet not balk

My taste for venison: cease from idle talk.â

4. âShould I not purchase the release I crave,

Yet let me keep the promise that I gave

A brahmin friend. Tomorrowâs dawn shall see

My honour saved, and my return to you.â 
[5.14]

5. âStanding so near to death, what is the thing

That thus do sorely trouble you, O king?

Tell me the truth, that so perhaps we may

Consent to let you go for one brief day.â 
{5.25}

6. âA promise once I to a brahmin made;

That promise still is due, that debt unpaid:

The vow fulfilled, tomorrowâs dawn shall see

My honour saved, and my return to you.â

7. âA promise to a brahmin you have made;

That promise still is due, that vow unpaid.

Fulfil your vow, and let tomorrow see

Your honour saved and your return to me.â

8. âEscaped from cruel Yakkha he did come

Full of sweet longings to his lovely home: 
{5.26}

His word to brahmin friend he never broke,

But thus to dear AlÄ«nasattu spoke.


9. âMy son, reign you anointed king today

Ruling oâer friend and foe with righteous sway;

Let no injustice mar your happy state;

I now from cruel Yakkha seek my fate.â â

10. âFain would I learn what act or word

Lost me the favour of my lord,

That you should raise me to the throne

Which, losing you, I would not own.â

11. âDear son, I fail to call to mind

A single word or act unkind,

But now that honourâs debt is paid,

Iâll keep the vow to Yakkha made.â 
[5.15] {5.27}

12. âNay, I will go and you stay here;

No hope of safe return, I fear.

But should you go, Iâll follow you

And both alike will cease to be.â

13. âWith you does moral law agree,

But life would lose all charm for me,

If on wood-spit this Yakkha grim

Should roast and eat you, limb by limb.â

14. âIf from this Yakkha you will fly,

For you I am prepared to die:

Yea, gladly would I die, O king,

If only life to you I bring.â 
{5.28}

15a. âThen the brave prince to his dear parents bade

A last farewell, with low obeisance made.â

15b. âHis sire with outstretched arms, his son to stay,

Wept sore. His mother, grieving, swooned away.â

16. âBut when his son had vanished quite

From his despairing fatherâs sight,

With hands upraised the gods he praised

Kings Varuna and Soma hight,

Brahma and lords of Day and Night.

By these kept safe and sound of limb,

Escape, dear son, from Yakkha grim. 
[5.16] {5.29}


17. As RÄmaâs fair-limbed mother won 
See 
RÄmÄyaá¹a,
 book iii.

Emancipation for her absent son,

When woods of Daá¹á¸aka he sought,

So for my child is freedom wrought;

By this Truth Assertion Iâve charmed

The gods to bring you home unharmed.


18. Brother, in you no fault at all

Open or secret I recall;

By this Truth Assertion Iâve charmed

The gods to bring you home unharmed.


19. Void of offence are you to me,

I too, my lord, bear love to you;

By this Truth Assertion Iâve charmed

The gods to bring you home unharmed.â
 {5.30}

20. âWhence are you, youth so fair and fine?

Knowest you this forest realm is mine?

They hold their lives but cheap who come

Where savage Yakkhas find a home.

21. âI know you, cruel Yakkha, well;

Within this forest you do dwell.

Jayaddisaâs true son stands here:

Eat me and free my father dear.â

22. âJayaddisaâs true son I know;

Your looks confess that it is so. 
{5.31}

A hardship surely âtis for you

To die, to set your father free.â

23. âNo mighty deed is this, I feel,

To die, and for a fatherâs weal

And motherâs love to pass away

And win the bliss of heaven for aye.â

24. âNo evil deed of mine at all,

Open or secret, I recall:

Well weighed are birth and death by me,

As here, so âtis in worlds to be.


25. Eat me today, O mighty one,

And do the deed that must be done.

Iâll fall down dead from some high tree,

Then eat my flesh, as pleaseth you.â 
{5.32}

26. âIf âtis your will to sacrifice

Your life, young prince, to free your sire,

Then go in haste is my advice

And gather sticks to light a fire.â

27. âThen the brave prince did gather wood

And, rearing high a mighty pyre,

Cried, lighting it, prepare your food;

See! I have made a goodly fire.â

28. âStand not and gaze in dumb amaze,

Take me and slay, and eat, I pray, 
{5.33}

While still alive, I will contrive

To make you fain to eat today.â

29. âOne so truthful, kindly, just,

Surely never may be eaten,

Or his head, who eats you, must

Be to sevenfold pieces broken.â

30. âTo Sakka 
See Ja 316 
SasajÄtaka
. The commentary adds that in the present Kalpa the moon is marked by a Yakkha instead of a hare.
 once like some poor brahmin dressed

The hare did offer its own flesh to eat;

Thenceforth its form was on the moon impressed;

That gracious orb as Yakkha now we greet.â 
{5.34}

31. âAs the clear moon from RÄhuâs grip set free

Shines at mid-month with wonted brilliancy,

So too do you, Kampillaâs lord of might,

Escaped from Yakkha, shed the joyous light

Of your bright presence, sorrowing friends to cheer,

And bring back gladness to your parents dear.â

32. âThen did bold prince AlÄ«nasattu pay

All due obeisance to that Yakkha grim,

And free once more did wend his happy way

Back to Kampilla, safe and sound of limb.â
 [5.19]

33. âThus faring forth afoot from town and countryside,

Lo! Eager throngs proclaim

The doughty heroâs name,

Or as aloft on car or elephant they ride

With homage due they come

To lead the victor home.â

The Teacher, having ended his lesson, revealed the Truths and identified the JÄtaka. At the conclusion of the Truths the elder who supported his mother was established in the fruition of the First Path. âAt that time the father and mother were members of the kingâs household, the ascetic was SÄriputta, the man-eater was Aá¹gulimÄla, the young sister was Uppalavaá¹á¹Ä, the queen consort was RÄhulaâs mother, prince AlÄ«nasattu was myself.â

 as he sat preaching from a magnificent throne, and observing his person to be endued with extreme beauty of form arising from the power of illimitable merit, she thought: âI wonder whether in a former existence those I once ministered to were this manâs wives.â Then at that very moment the recollection of former existences came back to her. âIn the time of Chaddanta, the elephant, I was previously existing as this manâs wife.â And at the remembrance great joy and gladness sprang up in her heart.


In her joyous excitement she laughed aloud as she thought: âFew wives are well disposed to their husbands; most of them are ill disposed. I wonder if I were well or ill disposed to this man.â And calling back her remembrance, she perceived that she had harboured a slight grudge in her heart against Chaddanta, the mighty lord of elephants, who measured one hundred and twenty cubits, and had sent Sonuttara, a hunter, who with a poisoned arrow wounded and killed him. Then her sorrow awoke and her heart grew hot within her, and being unable to control her feelings, bursting into sobs she wept aloud. On seeing this the Teacher broke into a smile, and on being asked by the assembly of the monks, âWhat, sir, was the cause of your smiling?â he said: âMonks, this young nun wept, on recalling a wrong she once committed against me.â And so saying he told a story of the past.
 {5.37}

1. âLarge-eyed and peerless one, my queen, so pale, to grief a prey,

Like wreath thatâs trampled under foot, why fadest you away?â

2. âAs it would seem, all in a dream, a longing sore I had;

My wish is vain this boon to gain, and that is why Iâm sad.â

3. âAll joys to which in this glad world a mortal may aspire,

Whateâer they want is mine to grant, so tell me your desire.â

4. âLet hunters all obey your call, within this realm who dwell,

And what I fain from them would gain, Iâll in their presence tell.â

5. âHere then behold our hunters bold, well trained in venery,

Theirs is the skill wild beasts to kill, and all would die for me.â

6. âYou hunters bold, assembled here,

Unto my words, I pray, give ear:

Dreaming, I thought an elephant I saw,

Six-tusked 
The Commentator explains 
chabbisÄna
 (Sanskrit 
shaá¸viá¹£Äna
) six-tusked as 
chabbaá¹á¹a
 six-coloured, perhaps more completely to identify the hero of the story with the Buddha.
 and white without a flaw:

His tusks I crave and fain would have;

Nought else avails this life to save.â

7. âNeâer did our sires in times of old

A six-tusked elephant behold: 
{5.42}

Tell us what kind of beast might be

That which appeared in dreams to you.â 
[5.24]

8. âFour points, North, South, East, West, one sees,

Four intermediate are to these,

Nadir and zenith add, and then

Say at which point of all the ten

This royal elephant might be,

That in a dream appeared to you.â

9. âDue north, beyond seven mountains vast,

One comes to Golden Cliff at last,

A height by Kimpurisas possessed

And bright with flowers from foot to crest.


10. Beneath Kinnara peak is seen

A cloud-shaped mass of darkest green, 
{5.43}

A royal banyan tree whose roots

Yield vigour to eight thousand shoots.


11. There dwells invincible in might

This elephant, six-tusked and white,

With herd eight thousand strong for fight.

Their tusks to chariot-poles are like,

Wind-swift are they to guard or strike.


12. Panting and grim they stand and glare,

Provoked by slightest breath of air,

If they one born of man should see,

Their wrath consumes him utterly.â

13. âTurquoise or pearls of brilliant sheen,

With many a gold adornment, queen,

In royal houses may be seen. 
{5.44}

What would you then with ivory do,

Or will you slay these hunters true?â

14. âConsumed with grief and spite am I,

When I recall my injury.

Grant me, O hunter, what I crave,

And five choice hamlets you shall have.â

15. âWhere dwells he? Where may he be found?

What road is his, for bathing bound?

Where does this royal creature swim?

Tell us the way to capture him.â 
{5.45}

16. âNot far this bathing-place of his,

A deep and goodly pool it is:

There bees do swarm and flowers abound,

And there this royal beast is found.


17. Now lotus-crowned, fresh from his bath

He gladly takes his homeward path,

As lily-white and tall he moves

Behind the queen he fondly loves.â

18. âThe hunter hearing, unalarmed,

Set forth with bow and quiver armed,

And crossing oâer seven mountains vast

Reached noble Golden Cliff at last. 
[5.27]


19. Gaining Kinnara-haunted height,

What cloud-shaped mass bursts on his sight?

A royal banyan âtis whose roots

Support eight thousand spreading shoots. 
{5.48}


20. There stood invincible in might

An elephant six-tusked and white,

With herd eight thousand strong for fight;

Their tusks to chariot-poles are like:

Wind-swift are they to guard or strike.


21. Hard by a pool â âtis full to the brim,

Fit place for royal beast to swim;

Its lovely banks with flowers abound

And buzzing bees swarm all around.


22. Marking the way the creature went

Wheneâer on bathing thought intent,

He sunk a pit, to deed so mean

Urged by the wrath of spiteful queen.â

23. âThe pit with planks he first did hide,

Then bow in hand he got inside,

And as the elephant passed by,

A mighty shaft the wretch let fly.


24. The wounded beast loud roared with pain

And all the herd roared back again:

Crushed boughs and trampled grass betray

Where panic flight directs their way.


25. Their lord had well nigh slain his foe,

So mad with pain was he, when lo!

A robe of yellow met his eyes,

Arahatâs flag, monastic guise

And deemed inviolate by the wise.â
 [5.28] {5.50}

26. âWhoso is marred with sinful taint

And void of truth and self-restraint,

Though robed in yellow he may be,

No claim to sanctity has he.


27. But one thatâs free from sinful taint,

Endued with truth and self-restraint,

And firmly fixed in righteousness,

Deserves to wear the yellow dress.â
 {5.51}

28. âThe beast with mighty shaft laid low,

Unruffled still, addressed his foe:

âWhat object, friend, in slaying me,

And, pray, who instigated thee?â â

29. âThe king of KÄsiâs favoured queen

SubhaddÄ told me she had seen

Your form in dreams, and so, said she,

Iâll have his tusks; go, bring them me.â

30. âRich store of goodly tusks have I,

Relics of my dead ancestry,

And this well knows that cursed dame,

âTis at my life the wretch does aim. 
{5.52}


31. Rise, hunter, and or ere I die.

Saw off these tusks of ivory:

Go bid the shrew be of good cheer,

The beast is slain; his tusks are here.â

32. âThe hunter then the tusks did saw

From out that noble creatureâs jaw,

And with his shining, matchless prize

Home with all speed he quickly hies.â

33. âSad at his death and full of fright,

The herd that took to panic flight,

Seeing no trace of cruel foe,

Returned to find their chief laid low.â 
{5.54}

34. âThey wept and wailed, as it is said,

Each heaping dust upon his head,

Then slow returning home were seen,

Behind their ever gracious queen.â

35. âThe hunter straight to KÄsi hies

Bearing his bright and matchless prize

â The noble creatureâs tusks, I mean,

Cheering all hearts with golden sheen â

And to that royal dame he said,

Here are his tusks: the beast is dead.â
 {5.55}

36. âHis tusks no sooner did she see â

Her own dear lord of old was he â

Than straight her heart through grief did break

And she, poor fool, died for his sake. 
[5.31]


37. When he, almighty and all wise,

Broke into smiles before their eyes,

Straightway these holy monks bethought,

Sure Buddhas never smile for nought.


38. She whom you used to see, he said,

A yellow-robed ascetic maid,

Was erst a queen and I, he cried,

Was that king elephant who died.


39. The wretch who took those tusks so white,

Unmatched on earth, so shining bright, 
{5.56}

And brought them to Benares town

Is now as Devadatta known.


40. Buddha from his own knowledge told

This long drawn tale of times of old,

In all its sad variety,

Though free from pain and grief was he.


41. That elephant of long ago

Was I, the king of all the band,

And, monks, I would have you so

This Birth aright to understand.â

These verses were recorded by elders as they chanted the Dhamma and sang the praises of the One with Ten Powers.
 {5.57}
 And on hearing this discourse a multitude entered the First Path, but the nun afterwards by spiritual insight became an Arahat.

In the present the monks speak about the Buddhaâs wisdom, and he tells this story illustrating his wisdom in a past life when a king, desiring to be instructed in goodness and truth, sought wise men throughout his realm, but they were unable to answer him. Eventually he obtained his answer from the Bodhisatta, a wise boy just seven years old.

## Full Story
âThis rule.â
 This story the Teacher when residing at Jetavana told concerning the Perfection of Wisdom. The circumstances leading to the introductory story will be set forth in the MahÄ-ummaggajÄtaka [Ja 546].

One day the monks sat in the Dhamma Hall and described the TathÄgataâs Perfection of Wisdom, âMonks, the TathÄgata is greatly wise, his wisdom is vast, ready, swift, sharp, crushing heretical doctrines, after having converted, by the power of his own knowledge, the brahmins KÅ«á¹­adanta and the rest, the ascetics Sabhiya and the rest, the thieves Aá¹gulimÄla and the rest, the Yakkhas Äá¸·avaka and the rest, the Devas Sakka and the rest, and the Brahmas Baka and the rest, made them humble, and ordained a vast multitude as ascetics and established them in the fruition of the paths of sanctification.â The Teacher came up and asked what they were discoursing about, and when they told him, he replied, âNot only now is the TathÄgata wise â in the past also, before his knowledge was fully mature, he was full of all wisdom, as he went about for the sake of wisdom and knowledge,â and then he told a story of the past.

1. âThis rule and lordship I disdain,

SucÄ«rata, for I would fain

Be great, and oâer the wide world reign. 
[5.32]


2. By right alone â wrong I eschew â

For whatsoeâer is good and true

Kings above all men should pursue.


3. By this for ever free from blame,

Here and hereafter, we may claim

âMidst gods and men a glorious name.


4. Know, brahmin, that I fain would do

Whateâer is deemed both good and true,

So pray, when asked, declare to me

The good and true, what they may be.â
 {5.58}

5. âNo one but Vidhura, 
Vidhura, the commentary explains, was the chaplain of the king of Benares.
 O king,

Hath power to tell this wondrous thing,

What is, my lord, the good and true,

That you are ever fain to do.â

6. âLo! Straight this weight of gold, my friend,

By you to Vidhura I send;

Meet gift for sage who best can show

The good and true that I would know.â 
{5.59}

7. âThen straight in haste did BhÄradvÄja 
BhÄradvÄja is the family name of SucÄ«rata.
 wend

His way to Vidhura, and found his friend

Sitting at home, and ready to partake

Of simple fare, his early fast to break.â 
[5.33]

8. âI come at far-famed Kuru kingâs behest,

Sprung from Yudhiá¹­á¹­hila, 
The Kurus were descended from Yudhiá¹£á¹­hira.
 and this his quest,

To ask you, Vidhura, to tell to me

The good and true, what it may surely be.â 
{5.60}

9. âOâerwhelmed by such a mighty theme

As âtwere by Gangeâs flooded stream,

I cannot tell what this may be,

The good and true you seek from me.â

10. âA son I have, my very own,

âMongst men as BhadrakÄra known;

Go seek him out, and heâll declare

To you what truth and goodness are.â

11. âThen BhÄradvÄja hastily

To BhadrakÄraâs home did hie,

Where amidst friends, all gathered round,

Seated at ease the youth was found.â

12. âI come at far-famed Kuru kingâs behest,

Sprung from Yudhiá¹­á¹­hila, and this his quest,

To ask you, BhadrakÄra, to show me

Goodness and truth, what they may surely be.â

13. âGood venison I leave, a lizard to pursue:

How then should I know aught about the good and true?


14. Iâve a young brother, you must know,

Named SaÃ±jaya. So, brahmin, go

And seek him out, and heâll declare

To you what truth and goodness are.â

15. âThen BhÄradvÄja hastily

To home of SaÃ±jaya did hie,

Where amidst friends, all gathered round,

Seated at ease the youth was found.


16. I come at far-famed Kuru kingâs behest,

Sprung from Yudhiá¹­á¹­hila, and this his quest,

To ask you, SaÃ±jaya, to show to me

Goodness and truth, what they may surely be.â

17. âDeath opens wide his jaws for me,

Early and late. How tell to you

Of truth and goodness, what they be?


18. Iâve a young brother, you must know,

Called Sambhava. So, brahmin, go,

And seek him out. He will declare

To you what truth and goodness are.â
 [5.35]

19. âThis marvel strange I like not me,

Nor sire nor sons, none of the three,

Knows how to solve this mystery.


20. If you thus fail, can this mere youth

Know aught of goodness and of truth?â

21. âAsk Sambhava nor scorn his youth,

He knows right well and he can tell

Of goodness and of truth.


22. As the clear moon outshines the starry host,

Their meaner glories in his splendour lost,


23. Eâen so the stripling Sambhava appears

To excel in wisdom far beyond his years;

Ask Sambhava nor scorn his youth,

He knows right well and he can tell

Of goodness and of truth.


24. As charming April does all months outvie

With budding flowers and woodland greenery,


25. Eâen so the stripling Sambhava appears

To excel in wisdom far beyond his years;

Ask Sambhava nor scorn his youth,

He knows right well and he can tell

Of goodness and of truth.


26. As GandhamÄdana, its snowy height

With forest clad and heavenly herbs bedight,

Diffusing light and fragrance all around,

For myriad gods a refuge sure is found,


27. Eâen so the stripling Sambhava appears

To excel in wisdom far beyond his years;

Ask Sambhava nor scorn his youth,

He knows right well and he can tell

Of goodness and of truth.


28. As glorious fire, ablaze through some morass

With wreathing spire, insatiate, eats the grass

Leaving a blackened path, whereâer it pass,


29. Or as a ghee-fed flame in darkest night

On choicest wood does whet its appetite,

Shining conspicuous on some distant height,


30. Eâen so the stripling Sambhava appears

To excel in wisdom far beyond his years;

Ask Sambhava nor scorn his youth,

He knows right well and he can tell

Of goodness and of truth.


31. An ox by strength, a horse by speed,

Displays his excellence of breed,

A cow by milk in copious flow,

A sage by his wise words we know.


32. Eâen so the stripling Sambhava appears

To excel in wisdom far beyond his years;

Ask Sambhava nor scorn his youth,

He knows right well and he can tell

Of goodness and of truth.â
 {5.64}

33. âThen BhÄradvÄja hastily

To home of Sambhava did hie,

And there out in the public way

The little boy was found at play.â

34. âI come at far-famed Kuru kingâs behest,

Sprung from Yudhiá¹­á¹­hila, and this his quest,

To ask you, Sambhava, to show to me

Goodness and truth, what they may surely be.â

35. âIâll tell you, sir, and tell aright,

Eâen as a man of wisdom might,

The king shall know the good and true,

But who knows what the king will do?â

36. âIn answer to the king, SucÄ«rata, proclaim,

Tomorrow and today are never quite the same;

I bid you then, O king Yudhiá¹­á¹­hila, be wise

And prompt to seize whateâer occasion may arise.


37. I fain would have you too, SucÄ«rata, suggest

A thought in which his mind may profitably rest,

A king all wicked ways should carefully eschew,

Nor, like bewildered fool, an evil course pursue.


38. To loss of his own soul he never should transgress,

Nor eâer be guilty of deeds of unrighteousness,

Himself neâer be engaged in any evil way,

Nor ever in wrong path a brother lead astray.


39. These points to carry out whoso does rightly know,

Like waxing moon, as king in fame does ever grow. 


40. A shining light to friends and dear unto his kin,

And, when his body fails, the sage to heaven will win.â
 {5.67}

At the end of the lesson the Teacher said: âNot merely now, monks, but formerly too, the TathÄgata was great in answering questions,â and he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time Änanda was king DhanaÃ±jaya, Anuruddha was SucÄ«rata, Kassapa was Vidhura, MoggallÄna was BhadrakÄra, SÄriputta was the youth SaÃ±jaya, and I myself was the wise Sambhava.â

## Full Story
âA king of KÄsi.â
 This story was told by the Teacher, when dwelling in the Bamboo Grove, about Devadattaâs hurling a stone at him. 
{5.68}
 So when the monks blamed Devadatta for having instigated archers to shoot the Buddha and afterwards hurled a stone at him, the Teacher said: âNot only now, but formerly also, Devadatta flung a stone at me,â and so saying he related a story of the past.
 [5.38]

1. âA king of KÄsi who, they say,

Oâer great Benares once held sway,

With courtier friends the road to cheer,

Unto MigÄcira drew near. 
{5.69}


2. A brahmin there the king did see

â A walking skeleton was he â

His skin was white with leprous blood

And rough like gnarlÃ©d ebon wood. 
Bauhinia Variegata.


3. Astonished at the piteous sight

Of this sore troubled, luckless wight,

Alas, poor wretch, he cried, declare

What name âmongst Yakkhas you do bear.
 [5.39]


4. Your hands and feet are white as snow,

Your head is whiter still, I know,

Your frame with leprous spots oâergrown,

Disease has marked you for its own.


5. Your back like spindles in a row

A long unequal curve does show;

Your joints are as black knots; I ween,

Your like before was never seen.


6. Whence came you then, so travel-worn,

Mere skin and bones, a wretch forlorn,

By heat of blazing sun oppressed,

By thirst and hunger sore distressed?


7. With frame so marred, an awful sight,

Scarce fit to look upon the light,

Your very mother â no, not she

Would care her wretched son to see.


8. What sinful deed was thine, I pray,

Or wrongfully whom did you slay?

What the offence I fain would know,

Reduced you to this state of woe?â

9. âIâll tell you, sir, and tell you true

Eâen as a good man aye should do:

For one that never speaketh lies

Is praised in this world by the wise. 
{5.70}


10. Once in a lonely wood I took my way,

Seeking my kine that late had gone astray;

Through pathless tracts of jungle, fitting home

For the wild elephant, I heedless roam.


11. Lost in the maze of this vast wilderness,

From thirst and hunger suffering sore distress,

For seven long days I wander through the wood

Where the fell tiger rears his savage brood.


12. Eâen rankest poison I was fain to eat

When lo! a lovely tree my gaze does meet;

Oâer a sheer precipice it pendent swung,

And fragrant fruit from all its branches hung.


13. Whateâer had fallen to the windâs cold touch

I greedily devoured and relished much,

Then, still unsated, I climbed up the tree,

That way, I thought, lies full satiety.


14. I neâer had tasted such ripe fruit before,

And stretching forth my hand to gather more,

The branch, on which my body rested, broke,

As though clean severed by the woodmanâs stroke.


15. With broken bough head over heels I went,

With nought to check me in my swift descent

Over the side of rocky precipice,

Without escape from bottomless abyss.
 [5.40]


16. The depth of water in the pool beneath

Saved me from being rudely crushed to death,

So there, poor luckless wight, without a ray

Of hope to cheer me, ten long nights I lay.


17. At length a monkey came â long-tailed was he

And made his home in some rock cavity

And as he stepped from bough to bough, the brute

Did ever pluck and eat the dainty fruit.


18. But when my thin and pallid form he spied,

Touched with compassion for my woes, he cried,

âAlas, poor wretch, whom I see lying there

Thus overwhelmed with anguish and despair.


19. If a man or Amanussa declare.â

Then with due reverence I made reply;

âA man and doomed without escape am I:

But this I say, âAll blessings light on you,

If you can find a way of saving me.â â


20. The monkey stepping on the height above

Carried a heavy stone, his strength to prove,

And when by practice he was perfect grown,

The mighty one his purpose thus made known.


21. âClimb you, good sir, upon my back and cast

Your arms about my neck and hold me fast;

Then will I with all speed deliver you

From the stone walls of your captivity.â


22. I hearkened gladly, well remembering

The counsels of the glorious monkey-king,

And, climbing on his back, my arms I cast

Round the wise creatureâs neck and held him fast.


23. The monkey then â so brave and strong was he â

Exhausted by the effort though he be,

From rocky fastness soon uplifteth me.


24. And having haled me out, the hero cried,

Iâm weary: stand as guard, sir, by my side,

While I anon in peaceful sleep abide.


25. Lion and tiger, panther eke and bear, 
{5.71}

If they should ever take me unaware,

Would kill me straight. To watch shall be your care.


26. While, as I watched, he took a momentâs rest,

An ugly thought was harboured in my breast.


27. âMonkeys and such like deer are good to eat;

What if I kill him and my hunger cheat?

The beast if slain would furnish savoury meat.


28. When sated, here no longer will I stay

But well provisioned for full many a day

Out from this forest I will find a way.â


29. Taking a stone his skull I well nigh broke,

But a lame hand put forth a feeble stroke.


30. The monkey quickly bounded up a tree,

And all bestained with blood regarded me

From far, with tearful eyes, reproachfully.
 [5.41]


31. âGod bless you, act not thus, I pray, good sir,

For otherwise your fate, I dare aver,

Will long all others from such deeds deter.


32. Alas, for shame. What a return is this

For having saved you from that dread abyss!


33. Rescued from death you played a treacherous part

And evil have devised with evil heart.


34. Vile wretch, beware lest sharpest agony

Springing from evil deed bring death to thee,

Eâen as its fruit destroys the bamboo tree. 
The bamboo dies off after bearing fruit.


35. I trust you not, for you would work me ill:

Walk well in front that I may see you still.


36. From ravening beast escaped, you may regain

The haunts of men: the path that stretches plain

Before thine eyes, follow as you are fain.â


37. At this the monkey dried his tears, and sped

Up to a mountain lake, and bathed his head

From stain of blood â by me, alas, âtwas shed â


38. There too, with burning pains through him accursed,

I dragged my tortured frame, to quench my thirst,


39. But when to that blood-stainÃ©d lake I came,

The crimson flood appeared one mass of flame.
 {5.72}


40. Each liquid drop from it that did bedew

My body, straight into a pustule grew,

Like a cleft wood apple-fruit, in size and hue.


41. The sores discharging yield a loathsome smell,

And wheresoâer I fain would gladly dwell

In town and countryside, all fly pell-mell.


42. Scattered by odours foul, the while they ply

Their sticks and stones, and: âCome not you too nigh

To us, poor wretch,â all men and women cry.


43. Such is the pain for seven long years I bear;

According to his deeds each man does fare.


44. May good be with you all that here I see:

Betray you not your friends. How vile is he

That does wrong âgainst a friend with treachery.


45. All who on earth to friends have proved untrue,

As lepers here their wrongs must ever rue,

And when the body fails, in hell are born anew.
 {5.74}

The Teacher here ending his lesson said: âNot only now, monks, but formerly too, Devadatta flung a stone at me,â and he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the treacherous friend was Devadatta, I myself was the monkey-king.â

## Full Story
âNo man that lets.â
 
[5.42]
 This was a story told by the Teacher, while sojourning at Jetavana, as to how Devadatta told a lie, and how the earth opened and swallowed him up. At that time, when Devadatta was being blamed by the monks, the Teacher said: âNot only now, monks, but of old too Devadatta told a lie and was swallowed up by the earth,â and so saying he told a story of the past.

1. âThe man that lets his secret thought be known,

Random of speech, to indiscretion prone,

Poor fool, at once is overcome by fear,

As NÄga king is by a bird oâerthrown.


2. The man who in his folly could betray

The thought that he should hide from light of day,

By his rash speech is overcome by fear,

As NÄga king falls to this bird a prey.


3. No comrade ought your inmost thoughts to share,

The best of friends ofttimes most foolish are,

And if too wise, of treachery beware.


4. I trusted him, alas, for was not he

A holy man, of strict austerity?

My secret I revealed; the deed is done

And now I weep for very misery.


5. Into my confidence the wretch did creep,

Nor could I any secret from him keep:

From him the danger that I dread has come,

And now for very misery I weep.
 {5.78}


6. Judging his friend as faithful to the core

And moved by fear, or the strong love he bore,

To some vile wretch his secret one betrays

And is oâerthrown, poor fool, to rise no more.


7. Whoso proclaims in evil company

The secret thought that still should hidden lie,

âMongst men is counted as a poison-snake:

From such a one, pray, keep aloof, they cry.


8. Fair women, silken robes and sandalwood,

Garlands and perfumes, even drink and food,

Yea all desires â if only you, O bird,

Come to our aid â shall be by us eschewed.â
 {5.79}

9. âOf us three creatures living here, pray name

The one that rightly should incur the blame.

Nor monk nor bird, but foolish deed of thine,

O snake, hath brought you to this depth of shame.â

10. âThe monk, I thought, must be a friend to me,

A holy man, of strict austerity: 
{5.80}

My secret I betrayed: the deed is done,

And now I weep for very misery.â

11. âAll creatures born into this world must die;

Yet wisdomâs ways her children justify:

By knowledge, justice, self-restraint and truth

A man at length achieves his purpose high. 
[5.45]


12. Parents are kind all other kin above,

No third there is to show us equal love,

Not eâen to them betray your secret thought,

Lest peradventure they should traitors prove.


13. Parents and kin of every degree,

Allies and comrades all may friendly be:

To none of them entrust your hidden thought,

Or you will later rue their treachery.


14. A wife may youthful be and good and fair,

Own troops of friends, and childrenâs love may share:

Not eâen to her entrust your hidden thought,

Or of her treachery you must beware.â
 {5.81}

15. âHis secret no man should disclose, but guard like treasure-trove:

Disclosure of a secret thing no wise man would approve.


16. Wise men to woman or a foe their secrets neâer betray;

Trust not the slaves of appetite; creatures of impulse they.


17. Whoso reveals his secret thought to one not overwise,

Fears the betrayal of his trust and at his mercy lies.


18. All such as know the secret thing that you should rather hide,

Threaten your peace of mind; to none that secret thing confide.


19. By day to thine own self alone the secret dare to name,

But venture not at dead of night that secret to proclaim;

For close at hand, be sure, there stand men ready to betray

The slightest word they may have heard: so trust them not, I pray.â

20. âAs some huge city fenced on every side

With moat, of iron wrought, has long defied 
{5.82}

All entrance of foe to blessÃ©d land,

So eâen are they that do their counsels hide.


21. Who by rash speech to secrets give no clue,

But ever steadfast to themselves are true,

From them all enemies do keep aloof,

As men flee far when deadly snakes pursue.â

22. âA tonsured, nude ascetic left his home

And seeking alms did through the country roam:

To him my secret I alas did tell,

And straight from happiness and virtue fell.


23. What line of conduct should a monk pursue,

What vows take on him, and what faults eschew?

How free himself from his besetting wrongs,

And at the last a heavenly mansion win?â
 [5.46] {5.83}

24. âBy patience, self-restraint, long-suffering,

By calumny and ire abandoning,

Thus may a monk get rid of every wrong,

And at the last a heavenly mansion win.â

25. âAs mother gazing on her baby boy

Is thrilled in every limb with holy joy,

So upon me, O king of birds, bestow

That pity mothers to their children show.â

26. âAs of today from death I set you free;

Of kinds of children there are only three, 
{5.84}

Pupil, adopted child and true-born son:

Of these rejoice that you are surely one.â

27. âThe bird, so saying, straight released his foe

And gently bore him to the earth below;

Set free today, go, safe from danger dwell

In water or on land. Iâll guard you well.


28. As a skilled leech to men with sickness cursed,

Or a cool tank to those that are athirst,

As house that shelters from a chilling frost,

So I a refuge prove to you, when lost.â

29. âO snake, you madest peace with thine old enemy;

But now you show your fangs. Whence comes this fear to you?â 
[5.47]

30. âEver suspect a foe, nor trust your friend as staunch;

Security breeds fear, to kill you root and branch.


31. What! Trust the man with whom one quarrelled long ago!

Nay, stand upon your guard. No one can love his foe.


32. Inspire a trust in all, but put your trust in none,

Thyself suspected not, be to suspicion prone.

He that is truly wise ought every nerve to strain

That his true nature neâer may be to others plain.â

33. âThe godlike graceful pair of them now see,

Breathing an air of holy purity; 
{5.86}

Like steeds well matched âneath equal yoke they ran,

To seek the dwelling of that saintly man.â

34. âThen to the ascetic straight NÄga did go,

And thus Paá¹á¸araka addressed his foe,

âKnow that today, all danger past, Iâm free,

But âtis not due to love of thine for me.â â

35. âTo that bird-king, I solemnly declare,

I greater love than eâer to you did bear,

Moved by affection for that royal bird,

I of set purpose, not through folly, erred.â

36. âThe man that looks at this world and the next,

Neâer finds himself with love or hatred vexed,

âNeath garb of self-restraint you fain would hide

But lawless acts that holy garb belied. 
{5.87}


37. You, seeming noble, are with meanness stained,

And, as ascetic clad, are unrestrained;

By nature with ignoble thoughts accursed,

You in all kinds of sinful act are versed.â

38. âInformer, traitor, that would slay

A guileless friend, be your head riven

By this Truth Assertion, I pray,

Piecemeal, all into fragments seven.â 
[5.48]

39. âTherefore I say, friends neâer should treacherous be;

Than a false friend worse man is none to see.

Buried in earth the venomous creature lies,

And at the snake kingâs word the ascetic dies.â 
{5.88}

The Teacher here ended his discourse and said: âNot only now, monks, but of old too, Devadatta told a lie and was swallowed up by the earth,â and he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the ascetic was Devadatta, the snake king SÄriputta, and the Supaá¹á¹a king was myself.â

## Full Story
âTied to the spot.â
 This story the Teacher, while dwelling at Jetavana, told of queen MallikÄ. The introductory story is related at length in the KummÄsapiá¹á¸ajÄtaka [Ja 415].

The Teacher told this tale while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning queen MallikÄ. She was the daughter of the chief of the garland-makers of SÄvatthi, extremely beautiful and very good. When she was sixteen years of age, as she was going to a flower-garden with some other girls, she had three portions of sour gruel in a flower-basket. As she was leaving the town, she saw the Fortunate One entering it, diffusing radiance and surrounded by the assembly of the monks: and she brought him the three portions of gruel.


The Teacher accepted, holding out his royal bowl. She saluted the TathÄgataâs feet with her head, and taking her joy as subject of meditation, stood on one side. Observing her the Teacher smiled. The venerable Änanda wondered why the TathÄgata smiled and asked him the question. The Teacher told him the reason, âÄnanda, this girl will be today the chief queen of the Kosala king through the fruit of these portions of gruel.â The girl went on to the flower-garden.


That very day the Kosala king fought with AjÄtasattu and fled away in defeat. As he came on his horse he heard the sound of her singing, and being attracted by it he rode towards the garden. The girlâs merit was ripe: so when she saw the king she came without running away, and seized at the bridle by the horseâs nose. The king from horseback asked if she was married or no. Hearing that she was not, he dismounted, and being wearied with wind and sun rested for a little time in her lap: then he made her mount, and with a great army entered the town and brought her to her own house. At evening he sent a chariot and with great honour and pomp brought her from her house, set her on a heap of jewels, anointed her and made her chief queen.

Now by the efficacy of a gift of three portions of sour gruel to the TathÄgata, she that very day rose to the position of chief queen, and being possessed of faithful servants and endued with the five feminine charms, full of knowledge, and a disciple of the Buddha, she showed herself a devoted wife. Her devotion was blazed abroad throughout the city. So one day a discussion was started in the Dhamma Hall, how that queen MallikÄ was a faithful and devoted wife. The Teacher, on his coming there, asked the monks what was the topic they were discussing as they sat together, and on hearing what it was he said: âNot only now, but formerly too, monks, she was a devoted wife,â and so saying, he told a story of the past.

1. âTied to the spot and trembling as in fear,

Who in this rocky cave is standing here?

Tell us, I pray, O slender-waisted dame,

Who may your kinsmen be, and what your name.


2. Who are you, lady, ever fair and bright,

And what your birth that you can flood with light

This grove, fit home of every beast of prey?

A Yakkha I to you due homage pay.â
 {5.90}

3. âPrince Sotthisena, know full well, is heir to KÄsi throne,

And I, this princeâs wedded wife, as SambulÄ am known. 
[5.50]


4. Videhaâs royal son is sick and in the forest lies;

Alone I tend him, mad with pain, or else he surely dies.


5. This savoury bit of venison I picked up in the wood,

And bear it to my lord today, now faint for want of food.â

6. âWhat good is this sick lord of thine, O SambulÄ, to you?

No wife, but nurse is what he craves. I will your husband be.â


7. âWith sorrow worn, a wretch forlorn, no beauty can I claim,

If you are fain a bride to gain, go woo some fairer dame.â


8. âFour hundred wives have I to grace my home on yonder hill;

O lady, deign oâer them to reign, and each fond wish fulfil.


9. Fair maid so bright with golden light, whateâer is dear to you

Is mine to give, so come and live a life of joy with me.
 {5.91}


10. But if denied to me as bride, you are my lawful prey,

And will be good to serve as food to break my fast today.â


11. That Yakkha grim with his seven tufts inspiring dread alarm,

Found helpless SambulÄ astray and seized her by the arm.


12. Thus held by him, that Yakkha grim, her lustful, cruel foe,

She still deplored her absent lord, nor eâer forgot his woe.


13. âNo grief to me that I should be this hateful Yakkhaâs prey,

But that the love of my dear lord from me should fall away.


14. No gods are here, but absent far they flee,

Nor any guardians of the world I see,

To check the course of outrage and suppress

All acts of unrestrained licentiousness.â
 {5.92}

15. â âMongst women folk the chief in fame,

Sheâs wise and perfect, bright as flame,

Should you eat her, your skull be riven,

O Yakkha, into fragments seven.

So harm her not; let her go free,

For a devoted wife is she.â

16. âEscaped from Yakkha, to her hut she fled,

As bird returning finds its fledglings dead,

Or cow, robbed of her calf, laments an empty shed.


17. Thus SambulÄ, of royal fame, made moan,

Wild-eyed and helpless, in the wood, alone.


18. Hail, ascetics and brahmins, sages too,

Deserted, I for refuge fly to you.


19. All hail, you lions and you tigers fell,

And other beasts that in the woodland dwell.


20. All hail, you grasses, herbs and plants that creep,

All hail, you forests green and mountains steep.


21. All hail to night, bedecked with stars on high,

Dark as blue lotus of the deepest dye.
 {5.93}


22. All hail to Ganges: mother of rivers she,

Known amongst men as famed BhÄgÄ«rathÄ«.


23. Hail, Himavat, of all the mountains king,

Huge rocky pile, oâertopping everything.â

24. âIllustrious lady, why so late today?

What favoured lover led to this delay?â

25. âSeized by my foe, I, full of woe, these words to him did say:

âNo grief to me that I should be a hateful Yakkhaâs prey,

But that the love of my dear lord from me should fall away.â â

26. âYou jades are ever by far too clever,

Truth among such is a great rarity,

Ways of the sex are enough to perplex,

Eâen as the course of a fish in the sea.â

27. âMay truth for aye my shelter be,

As I love no man more than thee,

And by this Truth Assertion, I pray,

May your disease be healed today.â

28. âSeven hundred elephants by night and day

Are guarding you, all ready for the fray,

Hundreds of archers shielding you from harm;

Whence come the foes to fill you with alarm?â 
{5.96}

29. âFair as a lotus are the maids he loves,

Their swan-like voice his deepest passion moves,

And as he listens to their measured strain,

In his affections I no longer reign. 
[5.53]


30. In human shape like AccharÄ divine,

Adorned with ornaments of gold they shine,

Of perfect form the noble maidens lie

In graceful pose, to charm the royal eye.


31. If I once more might wander in the wood,

To glean a portion for his daily food,

Once more I should a husbandâs love regain,

And quit the court in forest realms to reign.


32. A woman may in softest robes be dressed,

And be with food in rich abundance blessed,

Fair though she be, yet if an unloved wife,

Best fix a rope and put an end to life.


33. Yea the poor wretch on bed of straw 
Reading 
kaá¹­adutiyÄ
.
 that lies,

If she find favour in her husbandâs eyes,

Enjoys a happiness unknown to one,

Rich in all else, but poor in love alone.â
 {5.97}

34. âA loving wife is ever hard to find,

As is a man that to his wife is kind:

Your wife was virtuous and loving too;

Do you, O king, to SambulÄ be true.â 
{5.98}

35. âShould you, with wealth in great abundance blessed,

Still pine away, by jealousy oppressed,

I and these maidens, creatures of your hand,

Will be obedient to your command.â

The Teacher here ended his lesson and saying: âNot only now, but formerly too, MallikÄ was a devoted wife,â he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time SambulÄ was MallikÄ, Sotthisena was the king of Kosala, and the ascetic father was myself.â

## Full Story
âZeal is the way.â
 
[5.54]
 This story the Teacher, dwelling at Jetavana, told concerning the admonition of a king. This admonition of a king has already been related in full. 
[We are referred for the story at Ja 334 to the story which comes after this one, Ja 521 
Tesakuá¹ajÄtaka
. I include it here.]

Now this king came to hear the preaching of the Dhamma and the Teacher addressed him in the following terms, âA king, sire, ought to rule his kingdom righteously, for whenever kings are unrighteous, then also are his officers unrighteous.â And admonishing him in the right way ... he pointed out the suffering and the blessing involved in following or abstaining from evil courses, and expounded in detail the misery resulting from sensual pleasures, comparing them to dreams and the like, saying: âIn the case of these men,

No bribe can move relentless death, no kindness mollify,

No one in fight can vanquish death. For all are doomed to die.

And when they depart to another world, except their own virtuous action they have no other sure refuge, so that they must inevitably forsake low associations, and for their reputationâs sake they must not be careless, but be earnest and exercise rule in righteousness, even as kings of old, before Buddha arose, abiding in the admonition of the wise, ruled righteously and departing attained to the heavenly city,â and at the request of the king he told a story of the past.

1. âZeal is the way to NibbÄna, but sloth leads to death, it is said;

While vigilant souls never die, the careless are even as dead. 
[This first verse = Dhp 21.]


2. From pride as its root cometh sloth: from sloth cometh loss and decay:

Decay is the parent of wrong. All sloth, O great king, put away.


3. Brave souls by their sloth many times of wealth and of realm have been shorn,

And so village lords may become like the waif, without home, all forlorn.
 {5.100}


4. When a prince in his rule groweth slack, untrue to his name and his fame,

Should his wealth all at once disappear, of that prince it is counted as shame.


5. You are slack out of season, O king, from the right you have wandered away,

Your realm that so flourished of old to robbers does now fall a prey.


6. No son shall inherit your realm, with its treasures of gold and of corn,

Your realm to the spoiler a prey and you of your wealth liest shorn.


7. The prince that is stripped of his realm, with its stores and its wealth manifold,

His friends and his kith and his kin esteem him no more as of old.


8. His guards and his charioteers, his horse and his footmen so bold,

As they see him of all dispossessed, regard him no more as of old.


9. The fool of disorderly life is by evil advice led astray,

Soon stripped is the fool of his fame, as the snake its old skin casts away.


10. But the man who arising betimes unwearied and orderly is,

His oxen and kine thrive apace, and riches increasing are his.


11. Great king, ever open thine ears, and list to what people may say,

That seeing and hearing the truth, you may win to good fortune your way.â
 {5.101}

12. âStruck by an arrow in the fray,

So may PaÃ±cÄla mourn,

As I have cause to grieve today,

Thus wounded by a thorn.â

13. âYou are old, my good sir, and your sight is too dim

To discern things aright, Iâll be sworn;

As for king Brahmadatta, what is it to him,

That your foot has been pierced by a thorn.â

14. â âTis due to Brahmadatta, sure, that I am racked with pain,

Just as defenceless folk are oft by their oppressors slain.


15. By night to thieves a prey are we, to the tax men by day,

Lewd folks abound within the realm, when evil kings bear sway.


16. Distressed by such a fear as this, men to the forest flee,

And round their dwellings scatter thorns, for their security.â
 {5.103}

17. âOh! When will Brahmadatta die, for long as he shall reign,

Our daughters live unwedded and for husbands sigh in vain?â

18. âEvil and profitless withal these words of thine, O jade,

Whence shall the king find in his realm a husband for each maid?â 
{5.104}

19. âNot evil are these words of mine, nor spoken all in vain,

So long as your defenceless folk are by oppressors slain.


20. By night to thieves a prey are we, to the tax men by day,

Lewd folks abound within the realm, when evil kings bear sway,

When times are bad, poor maids are sad, for husbands none have they.â

21. âSo may PaÃ±cÄla fall to earth by spear-thrust of his foe,

As SÄliya by ploughshare hurt, poor wretch, here lieth low.â

22. âWith Brahmadatta you are wroth, though no good cause is shown,

And while you do revile the king, the guilt is all thine own.â 
[5.57]

23. âWith Brahmadatta I am wroth, and rightly I maintain;

Defenceless folk are ever thus by their oppressor slain.


24. By night to thieves a prey are we, to the tax men by day,

Lewd folks abound within the realm, when evil kings bear sway,

When times are bad, poor maids are sad, for husbands none have they.
 {5.105}


25. The slave had twice

 to cook the food and brought it late to me;

While all agape for her, my ox was wounded fatally.â

26. âBy stroke of sword PaÃ±cÄlaâs lord shall fall amidst the fray,

As Iâm laid low by kick of cow, milk-pail and all, today.â

27. âA cow, say, kicks against the pricks, or pail of milk upsets â

Whatâs this to Brahmadatta that all this abuse he gets?â

28. âPaÃ±cÄlaâs king, O brahmin, is to blame, for in his reign

Defenceless folk are seen to be by their oppressors slain.


29. By night to thieves a prey are we, to the tax men by day,

Lewd folks abound within the realm, when evil kings bear sway,

When times are bad, poor maids are sad, for husbands none have they.


30. A wild and savage cow that we had never milked before

We milked today: demands for milk grow ever more and more.â
 {5.106}

31. âSo let PaÃ±cÄla pine away and childless weep in vain,

As this poor cow distracted seeks the calf that men have slain.â

32. âWhen from its herd some beast escapes, and roars to ease its pain,

Herein what cause have you of Brahmadatta to complain?â

33. âKing Brahmadattaâs wrong in this, brahmin, to me is plain,

Defenceless folk are ever thus by their oppressors slain.


34. By night to thieves a prey are we, to the tax men by day,

Lewd folks abound within the realm, when evil kings bear sway.

Why should a tender calf be killed, just for a sheath, I pray?â

35. âSo may PaÃ±cÄla killed in fight be eaten, sons and all,

As woodland frog to village crows a prey this day I fall.â

36. âKings cannot, frog, as you must know,

Guard every creature here below,

In this no wicked king is he,

That crows eat living things like you.â

37. âThe priest with words too flattering

Thus wickedly deceives the king;

The king, though people are oppressed,

Deems the priestâs policy the best.


38. If blessed with all prosperity

This realm should glad and peaceful be,

Crows richest offerings 
A crow was called 
balipuá¹­á¹­ho,
 ânourished by oblations.â
 might enjoy,

Nor need aught living to destroy.â
 {5.108}

The Teacher here ended his discourse to the king of Kosala in these words, âA king, sire, must forsake evil courses, and rule his kingdom righteously,â and he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the divinity of the ebony tree was myself.â

## Full Story
â âTis this I ask.â
 
[5.59] {5.109}
 This story the Teacher, while dwelling at Jetavana, told by way of admonition to the king of Kosala. Now this king came to hear the preaching of the Dhamma and the Teacher addressed him in the following terms, âA king, sire, ought to rule his kingdom righteously, for whenever kings are unrighteous, then also are his officers unrighteous.â And admonishing him in the right way as related in the CatukkanipÄta (4th Book) [Ja 334] he pointed out the suffering and the blessing involved in following or abstaining from evil courses, and expounded in detail the misery resulting from sensual pleasures, comparing them to dreams and the like, saying: âIn the case of these men,

No bribe can move relentless death, no kindness mollify,

No one in fight can vanquish death. For all are doomed to die.

And when they depart to another world, except their own virtuous action they have no other sure refuge, so that they must inevitably forsake low associations, and for their reputationâs sake they must not be careless, but be earnest and exercise rule in righteousness, even as kings of old, before Buddha arose, abiding in the admonition of the wise, ruled righteously and departing attained to the heavenly city,â and at the request of the king he told a story of the past.

1. â âTis this I ask Vessantara â dear bird, may you be blessed

To one thatâs fain oâer men to reign, what course of life is best?â

2. âKaá¹sa my sire, of KÄsi lord, so careless long ago,

Urged me his son, though full of zeal, still greater zeal to show.â

3. âFirst of all should a king put away all falsehood and anger and scorn;

Let him do what a king has to do, or else to his vow be forsworn.


4. By passion and wrong led astray, should he err in the past, it is plain

He will live to repent of the deed, and will learn not to do it again.


5. When a prince in his rule groweth slack, untrue to his name and his fame,

Should his wealth all at once disappear, of that prince it is counted as shame.


6. âTwas thus that Good Fortune and Luck, when I asked, made reply unto me,

In a man energetic and bold we delight, if from jealousy free.
 {5.113}


7. Ill Luck, ever wrecking good fortune, delighteth in men of ill deeds,

The hard-hearted creatures in whom a spirit of jealousy breeds.


8. To all, O great king, be a friend, so that all may your safety insure,

Ill Luck put away, but to Luck that is good be a dwelling secure.


9. The man that is lucky and bold, O you that oâer KÄsi do reign,

His foes will destroy root and branch, and to greatness will surely attain.


10. Great Sakka all courage in man ever watches with vigilant eyes,

For courage as virtue he holds and in it true goodness espies.


11. Gandhabbas, Petas, Devas, one and all, emulate such a king,

They all appearing stand by, of his zeal and his vigour to sing.


12. Be zealous to do what is right, nor, however reviled, yield to wrong,

Be earnest in efforts for good â no sluggard can bliss ever win.


13. Herein is the text of your duty, to teach you the way you should go:

âTis enough to win bliss for a friend or to work grievous ill for a foe.â
 {5.115}

14. âKuá¹á¸alinÄ«, of royal birth, could you resolve my quest,

To one thatâs fain oâer men to reign, what course of life is best?â

15. âThe matter, my friend, is set forth in a couple of maxims quite plain:

To keep whatsoever one has, and whatever one has not to gain.


16. Take as counsellors men that are wise, your interests clearly to see,

Not given to riot and waste, from gambling and drunkenness free.


17. Such a one as can guard you aright and your treasure with all proper zeal,

As a charioteer guides his car, he with skill steers the realmâs common weal.


18. Keep ever your folk well in hand; and duly take stock of your pelf,

Neâer trust to another a loan or deposit, but act for thyself.


19. What is done or undone to your profit and loss it is well you should know,

Ever blame the blameworthy and favour on them that deserve it bestow.
 {5.117}


20. You thyself, O great king, should instruct your people in every good way,

Lest your realm and your substance should fall to unrighteous officials a prey.


21. See that nothing is done by thyself or by others with overmuch speed,

For the fool that so acts without doubt will live to repent of the deed.


22. To wrath one should never give way, for should it due bounds overflow,

It will lead to the ruin of kings and the proudest of houses lay low.


23. Be sure that you never as king your people mislead to their cost,

Lest all men and women alike in an ocean of trouble be lost.


24. When a king from all fear is set free, and the pleasures of sense are his aim,

Should his riches and all disappear, to that king it is counted as shame.


25. Herein is a text of your duty, to teach you the way you should go,

Be an adept in every good work, to excess and to riot a foe,

Study virtue, for vice ever leads to a state full of suffering and woe.â
 {5.120}

26. âWeâve questioned both your brother prince, and also fair Kuá¹á¸alinÄ«;

Now, Jambuka, do you in turn the highest power declare to me.â

27. âAmidst the great ones of the earth a fivefold power we see;

Of these the power of limbs is, sure, the last in its degree,

And power of wealth, O mighty lord, the next is said to be.


28-29. The power of counsel third in rank of these, O king, I name;

The power of caste without a doubt is reckoned fourth in fame,

And all of these a man thatâs wise most certainly will claim.
 {5.121}


30. Of all these powers that one is best, as power of learning known,

By strength of this a man is wise and makes success his own.


31. Should richest realm fall to the lot of some poor stupid wight,

Another will by violence seize it in his despite.


32. However noble be the prince, whose lot it is to rule,

He is hard put to live at all, if he should prove a fool.


33. âTis wisdom tests reports of deeds and makes menâs fame to grow,

Who is with wisdom gifted still finds pleasure eâen in woe.


34. None that are heedless in their ways to wisdom can attain,

But must consult the wise and just, or ignorant remain.


35. Who early rising shall betimes unweariedly give heed

To dutyâs varied calls, in life is certain to succeed.


36. No one thatâs bent on hurtful things or acts in listless mood

In aught that he may undertake will come to any good.


37. But one that will unweariedly a rightful course pursue,

Is sure to reach perfection in whatever he may do.


38. To safeguard oneâs store is to gain more and more,

And these are the things I would have you to mind;

For the fool by ill deeds, like a house built of reeds,

Collapses and leaves rack and ruin behind.â
 {5.123}

39. âTo wives and to children, warrior king, do righteously; and so,

By living according to Dhamma to heaven the king shall go.

Follow wisdom and ever be happy, the truth in its fulness to know.â

The Teacher by means of his admonition of the king taught this lesson and identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the king was Änanda, Kuá¹á¸alinÄ« was Uppalavaá¹á¹Ä, Vessantara was SÄriputta, the bird Jambu was myself.â

âBeringed and gallantly.â
 This was a story the Teacher, while dwelling in the Bamboo Grove, told concerning the death of the elder, the Great MoggallÄna. 
For the death of MoggallÄna, see Dhp-a X.7.
 The elder SÄriputta, 
For SÄriputtaâs death, see Ja 95 
MahÄsudassanajÄtaka
.
 after gaining the consent of the TathÄgata 
[5.65]
 when he was living at Jetavana, went and died in the village of NÄla, in the very room where he was born. The Teacher, on hearing of his death, went to RÄjagaha and took up his abode in the Bamboo Grove. An elder dwelt there on the slopes of Isigili (Mount of Saints) at the Black Rock. This man, by attaining perfection in Supernormal Powers, was able to make his way into heaven and hell. In the Deva world he beheld one of the disciples of Buddha enjoying great power, and in the world of men he saw one of the disciples of the heretics suffering great agony, and on returning to the world of men he told them how in a certain Deva world such and such a lay brother or sister was reborn and enjoying great honour, and amongst the followers of the heretics such and such a man or woman was reborn in hell 
{5.126}
 or other states of suffering. People gladly accepted his dispensation and rejected that of the outsiders. Great honour was paid to the disciples of Buddha, while that paid to the schismatics fell away.


They conceived a grudge against the elder, and said: âAs long as this fellow is alive, there are divisions amongst our followers, and the honour paid to us falls away: we will put him to death,â and they gave a thousand pieces of money to a brigand who guarded the ascetics to put the elder to death. He resolved to kill the elder, and came with a great following to Black Rock. The elder, when he saw him coming, by his Supernormal Powers flew up into the air and disappeared. The brigand, not finding the elder that day, returned home and came back day after day for six successive days. But the elder, by his Supernormal Powers, always disappeared in the same way. On the seventh day an act committed of old by the elder, carrying with it consequences to be recognised on some future occasion, got its chance for mischief.


The story goes that once upon a time, hearkening to what his wife said, he wanted to put his father and mother to death; and, taking them in a carriage to a forest, he pretended that they were attacked by robbers, and struck and beat his parents. Through feebleness of sight being unable to see objects clearly, they did not recognise their son, and thinking they were robbers said: âDear son, some robbers are killing us: make your escape,â and lamented for him only. He thought: âThough they are being beaten by me, it is only on my account they make lamentation. I am acting shamefully.â So he reassured them and, pretending that the robbers had been put to flight, he stroked their hands and feet, saying: âDear father and mother, do not be afraid, the robbers have fled,â and brought them again to their own house. This action for ever so long not finding its opportunity but ever biding its time, like a core of flame hidden under ashes, caught up and seized upon the man when he was reborn for the last time, and the elder, in consequence of his action, was unable to fly up into the air. His Supernormal Powers that once could quell Nanda and Upananda 
Nanda and Upananda were two kings of the NÄgas, Vejayanta was the palace of Indra. 
JÄtaka
 Index, vol. vii. p. 66, gives corrected reading 
Nandopanandadamana.
 and cause Vejayanta to tremble, as the result of his action became mere feebleness.


The brigand crushed all his bones, subjecting him to the âstraw and mealâ torture, 
But cf. 
Aá¹guttaranikÄya,
 Pt. i. p. 114, ed. by R. Morris, 1883, 
MilindapaÃ±hÄ 
i. 277. Translation with note by R. Davids.
 and, thinking he was dead, went off with his followers. But the elder, on recovering consciousness, clothed himself with meditation as with a garment, and flying up by Supernormal Powers into the presence of the Teacher, saluted him and said: âVenerable sir, my sum of life is exhausted: I would die,â and having gained the Teacherâs consent, he died then and there.


At that instant the six Deva worlds were in a general state of commotion. âOur Teacher,â they cried, âis dead.â And they came, bringing incense and perfume and wreaths breathing divine odours, and all kinds of wood, 
{5.127}
 and the funeral pile was made of sandalwood and ninety-nine precious things.


The Teacher, standing near the elder, ordered his remains to be deposited, and for the space of a league all round about the spot where the body was burned flowers rained down upon it, and men and gods stood mingled together, and for seven days held a sacred festival. The Teacher had the relics of the elder gathered together, and erected a shrine in a gabled chamber in the Bamboo Grove.


At that time they raised the topic in the Dhamma Hall, saying: âSirs, SÄriputta, because 
[5.66]
 he did not die in the presence of the TathÄgata, has not received great honour at the hands of the Buddha, but the great elder MoggallÄna, because he died near the Teacher, has had great honour paid to him.â The Teacher came up, and asking the monks what they were sitting in a meeting to discuss, on hearing what it was, said: âNot only now, monks, but formerly also MoggallÄna received great honour at my hands,â and, so saying, he related a story of the past.

1. âBeringed and gallantly arrayed,

All girt with jewel-hilted blade,

Halt you, great chiefs, and straight declare

What name âmidst world of men you bear?â 
{5.137}

2. âBhÄ«maratha, Kaliá¹ga famed,

And Aá¹­á¹­haka â thus are we named â

To look on saints of life austere

And question them, are we come here.â

3. âYou 
The third person with nominative 
bhavaá¹
 understood seems to be used here for the second person. 
 in mid-heaven are fixed on high

Like full-orbed moon that gilds the sky,

I ask you, mighty spirit, say

How are you known on Earth, I pray.â 
[5.74]

4. âSujampati in heaven proclaimed

As MaghavÄ on Earth is named;

This king of gods today comes here

To see these saints of life austere.â 
{5.138}

5. âWide known to fame this saintly band,

With mighty powers at their command:

I gladly bid you hail: in worth

You far surpass the best on earth.â

6. âThe person of an aged saint

Is rank, the very air to taint.

Great Sakka, beat a quick retreat

From saintly odours, none too sweet.â 
{5.139}

7. âThough aged saints offend the nose

And taint the sweetest air that blows:

The floweretsâ fragrant wreath above

This odour of the saints we love;

In gods it may no loathing move.â

8. âFamed MaghavÄ, Sujampati

â Almsgiver, lord of Devas is he â

Queller of Asuras, heavenly king,

Craves leave to put his questioning.


9. Who of the sages that are here

Will make their subtle questions clear

For three who over men hold sway,

And Sakka whom the gods obey?â 
{5.140}

10. â âTis Sarabhaá¹ga, sage and saint,

So chaste and free from lustful taint,

The teacherâs son, well disciplined,

Solution of their doubts will find.â

11. âThe holy men, KondaÃ±Ã±a, 
This, the commentator explains, is the family name of Sarabhaá¹ga.
 pray

That you would clear their doubts away;

This burden lies, as mortals hold,

On men in years and wisdom old.â

12. âI give you leave to ask whateâer

You most at heart are fain to hear;

I know both this world and the next;

No question leaves my mind perplexed.â 
{5.141}

13. âSakka, to cities bountiful, that sees the truth of things,

To learn what he was fain to know, began his questionings.â

14. âWhat is it one may slay outright and never more repent;

What is it one may throw away, with all good menâs consent;

From whom should one put up with speech, however harsh it be?

This is the thing that I would have KondaÃ±Ã±a tell to me.â

15. âAnger is what a man may slay and never more repent;

Hypocrisy he throws away with all good menâs consent;

From all he should put up with speech, however harsh it be,

This form of patience, wise men say, is highest in degree.â


16. âRude speech from two one might with patience hear,

From oneâs superior, or from a peer,

But how to bear from meaner folk rude speech

Is what I fain would have KondaÃ±Ã±a teach.â


17. âRude speech from betters one may take through fear

Or, to avoid a quarrel, from a peer, 
{5.142}

But from the mean to put up with rude speech

Is perfect patience, as the sages teach.â

18. âHow hard it is to judge a man thatâs polished in exterior

Be he oneâs better, equal or, it may be, oneâs inferior.

The best of men pass through the world oft times in meanest form disguised;

So then bear with rough speech from all, if you, my friend, be well advised.â

19. âNo royal force, however vast its might,

Can win so great advantage in a fight 
{5.143}

As the good man by patience may secure:

Strong patience is of fiercest feuds the cure.â

20. âYour words are grateful to mine ear,

But one thing more I fain would hear;

Tell us the fate of Daá¹á¸aki

And of his fellow-sinners three,

Destined to suffer what rebirth

For harassing the saints on earth.â

21. âUprooted, realm and all, erewhile

Who Kisavaccha did defile,

Oâerwhelmed with fiery embers, see,

In Kukkula lies Daá¹á¸aki.


22. Who made him sport of priest and saint

And preacher, free from sinful taint,

This NÄá¸·ikÄ«ra trembling fell

Into the jaws of dogs in hell.


23. So Ajjuna, who slew outright

That holy, chaste, long-suffering wight, 
{5.144}

Aá¹gÄ«rasa, was headlong hurled

To tortures in a suffering world.
 [5.77]


24. Who once a sinless saint did maim

â Preacher of patience was his name â

KalÄbu now does scorch in hell,

âMidst anguish sore and terrible.


25. The man of wisdom that hears tell

Of tales like these or worse of hell,

Neâer âgainst monk or brahmin does wrong

And heaven by his right action wins.â
 {5.146}

26. âYour words are grateful to mine ear,

But one thing more I fain would hear:

Whom does the world as moral name,

And whom does it as wise proclaim?

Whom does the world for pious take,

And whom does fortune neâer forsake?â

27. âWhoso in act and word shows self-restraint,

And eâen in thought is free from sinful taint,

Nor lies to serve his own base ends â the same

All men as moral evermore proclaim.


28. He who revolves deep questions in his mind

Yet perpetrates nought cruel or unkind,

Prompt with good word in season to advise,

That man by all is rightly counted wise.


29. Who grateful is for kindness once received,

And sorrowâs need has carefully relieved,

Has proved himself a good and steadfast friend â

Him all men as a pious soul commend.


30. The man with every gift at his command,

True, tender, free and bountiful of hand,

Heart-winning, gracious, smooth of tongue withal â

Fortune from such a one will never fall.â
 {5.148}

31. âYour kindly words fall grateful on mine ear,

But one thing further I am fain to hear:

Virtue, fair fortune, goodness, wisdom â say

Which of all these do men call best, I pray.â


32. âWisdom good men declare is best by far,

Eâen as the moon eclipses every star

Virtue, fair fortune, goodness, it is plain,

All duly follow in the wise manâs train.â


33. âYour kindly words fall grateful on mine ear,

But one thing further I am fain to hear:

To gain this wisdom what is one to do,

What line of action or what course pursue?

Tell us what way the path of wisdom lies

And by what acts a mortal groweth wise.â
 [5.78]


34. âWith clever, old, and learned men consort,

Wisdom from them by questioning extort:

Their goodly counsels one should hear and prize,

For thus it is a mortal man grows wise.


35. The sage regards the lust of things of sense

In view of sickness, pain, impermanence;

âMidst sorrows, lust, and terrors that appal,

Calm and unmoved the sage ignores them all.


36. Thus would he conquer wrong, from passion free,

And cultivate a boundless generosity;

To every living creature mercy show,

And, blameless soul, to world of Brahma go.â
 {5.149}

37. âBhÄ«maratha by power of magic came

With you, O Aá¹­á¹­haka, and one to fame

As king Kaliá¹ga known, and now all three,

Once slaves to sensuality, are free.â 
{5.150}

38. â âTis so, you reader of menâs thoughts: all three

Of us from sensuality are free,

Grant us the boon for which we are right fain,

That to your happy state we may attain.â

39. âI grant 
Reading 
karomi
 for 
karohi.
 the boon that you would have of me,

The more that you from sensual vice are free:

So may you thrill with boundless joy to gain

That happy state to which you would attain.â

40. âWe will do everything at your behest,

Whateâer you in your wisdom deem the best;

So will we thrill with boundless joy to gain

That happy state to which we would attain.â

In Absorption delighting calmly rest;

This joy of holiness is far the best.â 
{5.151}

Set forth by holy sage in goodly speech,

The glorious beings to their heavenly home

Once more with joy and gratitude did come.


43. The holy sageâs strains strike on the ear

Pregnant with meaning and in accents clear;

 will surely find

The path to every stage of distinction,

And from the range of tyrant Death is free.â

Thus did the Teacher bring his teaching to a climax in Arahatship and saying: âNot only now, but formerly also, there was a rain of flowers at the burning of the body of MogallÄna,â he revealed the Truths and identified the JÄtaka,

âSÄlissara was SÄriputta, Meá¹á¸issara was Kassapa, 

Pabbata was Anuruddha, Devala was KaccÄyana, 

Anusissa was Änanda, Kisavaccha was Kolita, 

Sarabhaá¹ga the Bodhisatta: thus are you to understand the JÄtaka.â

## Full Story
âThen mighty Sakka.â
 {5.152}
 This story the Teacher, while residing at Jetavana, told about the temptation of a monk by the wife of his unregenerate days. The subject-matter of the tale is related in full in the IndriyajÄtaka [Ja 423].

The story is that a young man of good family at SÄvatthi heard the Teacherâs preaching, and thinking it impossible to lead a holy life, perfectly complete and pure, as a householder, he determined to become an ascetic in the dispensation which leads to safety and so make an end of misery. So he gave up his house and property to his wife and children, and asked the Teacher to ordain him. The Teacher did so. As he was the junior in his going about for alms with his teachers and instructors, and as the monks were many, he got no chair either in laymenâs houses or in the refectory, but only a stool or a bench at the end of the novices, his food was tossed him hastily on a ladle, he got gruel made of broken lumps of rice, solid food stale or decaying, or sprouts dried and burnt; and this was not enough to keep him alive. He took what he had got to the wife he had left: she took his bowl, saluted him, emptied it and gave him instead well-cooked gruel and rice with sauce and curry.


The monk was captivated by the love of such flavours and could not leave his wife. She thought she would test his affection. One day she had a countryman cleansed with white clay and set down in her house with some others of his people whom she had sent for, and she gave them something to eat and drink. They sat eating and enjoying it. At the house-door she had some bullocks bound to wheels and a cart set ready. She herself sat in a back room cooking cakes. Her husband came and stood at the door. Seeing him, one old servant told his mistress that there was an elder at the door. âSalute him and bid him pass on.â


But though he did so repeatedly, he saw the monk remaining there and told his mistress. She came, and lifting up the curtain to see, she cried, âThis is the father of my sons.â She came out and saluted him: taking his bowl and making him enter she gave him food: when he had eaten she saluted again and said: âSir, you are a saint now: we have been staying in this house all this time; but there can be no proper householderâs life without a master, so we will take another house and go far into the country: be zealous in your good works, and forgive me if I am doing wrong.â For a time her husband was as if his heart would break. Then he said: âI cannot leave you, do not go, I will come back to my worldly life; send a laymanâs garment to such and such a place, I will give up my bowl and robes and come back to you.â She agreed. The monk went to his monastery, and giving up his bowl and robes to his teachers and instructors he explained, in answer to their questions, that he could not leave his wife and was going back to worldly life.

Now the Teacher asked the monk, âIs it true, monk, that you were rendered discontented?â âIt is true, venerable sir.â âBy whom?â âBy my wife of former days.â âMonk,â he said, âthis woman wrought mischief for you: it was owing to her that you fell away from Absorption, and lay for three years in a lost and distracted condition, and on the recovery of your senses you uttered a great lamentation,â and so saying he told him a story of the past.

1. âThen mighty Sakka, lord of lords, the god that Vatra slew,

To his hall the DevakaÃ±Ã±Ä called, for well her wiles he knew.


2. And Fair AlambusÄ, he cried, the Deva host above

To the rishi bid you go, to tempt him with your love.â

3. âGo, Temptress, ever dog his steps, for holy sage is he,

And, seeking ever highest bliss, still triumphs over me.â

4. âWhy, king of gods, of all AccharÄ regard me alone,

And bid me to tempt the rishi that menaces your throne?


5. In griefless grove of Nandana is many a nymph divine,

To one of them â it is their turn â the hateful task assign.â
 {5.154}

6. âYou speakest truth; in griefless grove of Nandana, I ween,

May many a nymph, to rival you in loveliness, be seen.


7. But none like you, O peerless maid, with all a womanâs wile

This holy man in follyâs ways so practised to beguile.


8. Then queen of women as you are, go, lovely nymph, your way

And by the power of beauty force the saint to own your sway.â
 [5.81]

9. âI will not fail, O Deva-king, to go at your behest,

But still with fear this sage austere I venture to molest.


10. For many a one, poor fool, has gone (I shudder at the thought)

In hell to rue the suffering due to wrongs on saints he wrought.â

11. âThis said, AlambusÄ, AccharÄ, departed with speed,

Famed Isisiá¹ga to entice to some unholy deed. 
{5.155}


12. Into the grove for half a league with berries red so bright,

The grove where Isisiá¹ga dwelt, she vanished out of sight.


13. At break of day, ere yet the sun was scarce astir on high,

To Isisiá¹ga, sweeping out his cell, the nymph drew nigh.â

14. âWho are you, like to lightning flash, or bright as morning star,

With ears and hands bedecked with gems that sparkle from afar?


15. Fragrant as golden sandalwood, in brightness like the sun,

A slim and winsome maid are you, right fair to look upon.


16. So soft and pure, with slender waist and firmly springing gait,

Your movements are so full of grace, my heart they captivate.


17. Your thighs, like trunk of elephant, are finely tapering found,

Your buttocks soft to touch and like to any dice-board round.


18. With down like lotus filaments your navel marked, I ween,

As though with black collyrium âtwere charged, from far is seen.


19. Twin milky breasts, like pumpkins halved, their swelling globes display,

Firm set, although without a stalk all unsupported they.


20. Your lips are red as is your tongue, and, O auspicious sign,

Your neck long as the antelopeâs is marked with triple line. 
kambugÄ«va:
 three folds on the neck, like shell-spirals, were a token of luck, 
JÄtaka
 iv. 130.
 {5.156}


21. Your teeth brushed with a piece of wood, kept ever clean and bright,

Gleam in your top and lower jaw with flash of purest white.


22. Your eyes are long and large of shape, a lovely sight to view,

Like guÃ±jÄ berries black, marked out with lines of reddish hue.


23. Your hair is smooth, not over long and bound in neatest coil,

Is tipped with gold and perfumed with the finest sandal oil.


24. Of all that live by merchandise, by herds or by the plough,

Of all the mighty saints that live true to ascetic vow.


25. Amongst them all in this wide world your peer I may not see,

Then what your name and who your sire, we fain would learn from thee.â
 {5.157}

26. âHeaven bless you, Kassapa, 
Kassapa was the family name of Isisiá¹ga.
 my friend, the time is past and gone

For idle questions such as these â for are we not alone?

Come let us in your hermitage embracing haste to prove

The thousand joys well known to all the votaries of love.â 
[5.82]

27. âThis said, AlambusÄ, AccharÄ, departed with speed,

Famed Isisiá¹ga to entice to some unholy deed.â 
{5.158}

28. âTo check her flight, the holy man with motion swift as air

In hot pursuit oâertook the nymph and held her by the hair.


29. Just where he stood the lovely maid embraced him in her arms,

And straight his virtue fell before the magic of her charms.


30. In thought she flew to Sakkaâs throne in Nandana afar;

The god at once divined her wish and sent a golden car,


31. With trappings spread and all adorned with manifold array:

And there the saint lay in her arms for many a long day.


32. Three years passed oâer his head as though it were a momentâs space,

Until at last the holy man woke up from her embrace.


33. Green trees he saw on every side; an altar stood nearby,

And verdant groves re-echoing to the loud cuckoo cry.


34. He looked around and weeping sore he shed a bitter tear;

âI make no offering, raise no hymn; no sacrifice is here.


35. Dwelling within this forest lone, who can my tempter be?

Who by foul practice has oâercome all sense of right in me,

Eâen as a ship with precious freight is swallowed in the sea?â â
 {5.159}

36. âSent by king Sakka, here I stand

A willing slave at your command;

Though far too careless to know this,

âTwas thought of me that marred your bliss.â

37. âThus would kind Kassapa, my sire,

With prudence heedless youth inspire:

âWomen are fair as lotus flower,

Beware, good youth, their subtle power. 
[5.83]


38. Of womanâs budding charms beware,

Beware the danger that lurks there.â

âTwas thus my sire, by pity moved,

Would fain have warned the son he loved. 
{5.160}


39. My wise old fatherâs words, alas,

Unheeded I allowed to pass,

And so alone, in sore distress

I haunt today this wilderness.


40. Accursed be the life of old,

Henceforth Iâll do as I am told.

Far better death itself to face,

Than be again in such a case.â

41. âAlambusÄ no sooner knew

His steadfast power and courage true

Than bending low, the sage to greet,

The nymph straightway embraced his feet.


42. âO saint, all anger lay aside,

A mighty work I wrought,â she cried,

âWhen heaven itself and gods of fame

Trembled with fear to hear your name.â â

43. âMy blessing on the Thirty-Three

And VÄsava, their lord, and thee:

Depart, fair maid, for you are free.â

44. âEmbracing then the sageâs feet and circling to the right,

With hands in suppliant attitude, she vanished from his sight,


45. And mounting on the golden car, with trappings rich oâerspread,

All splendidly caparisoned, to heavenly heights she sped.


46. Like blazing torch or lightning flash, she passed across the sky,

And Sakka, glad at heart, exclaimed, âNo boon can I deny.â â
 [5.84]

47. âIf Sakka, King of the Devas, you would my heartâs desire allow,

Let me neâer tempt a saint again to violate his vow.â

The Teacher here ended his lesson to that monk and revealed the Truths and identified the JÄtaka. At the conclusion of the Truths that monk was established in the Fruit of the First Path. âAt that time AlambusÄ was the wife of his unregenerate days, Isisiá¹ga was the discontented monk, and the great saint his father was myself.â

In the present some lay people keep the Uposatha precepts. The Buddha tells a story of a king who was reborn as king of the NÄgas, but wearying of the life, wished to be reborn amongst men. In pursuit of that he kept the Uposatha precepts, even when badly treated by others. His rescuer followed his example.

## Full Story
âOf comely presence.â
 This was a story told by the Teacher, while dwelling at Jetavana, with regard to the duties of the Uposatha days. Now on this occasion the Teacher, expressing approval of certain lay folk who kept the Uposatha days, said: âWise men of old, giving up the great glory of the NÄga world, observed the Uposatha days,â and at their request he related a story of the past.

1. âOf comely presence and of gracious mien,

A scion you of noble rank, I ween;

Why then renounce earthâs joys and worldly gear

To adopt the asceticâs robe and rule severe?â

2. âO lord of men, I well remembering

The abode of that almighty NÄga king,

Saw the rich fruit that springs from holiness,

And straight believing donned monastic dress.â


3. âNor fear nor lust nor hate itself may make

A holy man the words of truth forsake:

Tell me the thing that I am fain to know,

And faith and peace within my heart will grow.â


4. âO king, on trading venture was I bound.

When these lewd wretches in my path were found,

A full-grown snake in captive chains was led,

And home in triumph joyously they sped.


5. As I came up with them, O king, I cried,

â Amazed I was and greatly terrified â

âWhere are you dragging, sirs, this monster grim,

And what, lewd fellows, will you do with him?â
 {5.166}


6. âThis full-grown snake that you see fettered thus

With its huge frame will furnish food to us.

Than this, Aá¸·Ära, you could hardly wish

To taste a better or more savoury dish.


7. Hence to our home weâll fly and in a trice

Each with his knife cut off a dainty slice

And gladly eat his flesh, for, as you know,

Snakes ever find in us a deadly foe.â


8. âIf this huge snake, late captured in the wood,

Is being dragged along to serve as food,

To each an ox I offer, one apiece,

Should you this serpent from his chains release.â


9. âBeef has for us a pleasant sound, I vow,

On snakeâs flesh we have fed full oft ere now,

Your bidding, O Aá¸·Ära, we will do;

Henceforth let friendship reign betwixt us two.â


10. Then they released him from the cord that passed

Right through his nose and knotted held him fast,

The NÄga king set free from durance vile

Turned him towards the east, then paused awhile,


11. And facing still the east, prepared to fly,

Looked back upon me with a tearful eye,

While I pursuing him upon his way

Stretched forth clasped hands, as one about to pray.


12. âSpeed you, my friend, like one in haste that goes,

Lest once again you fall amongst your foes,

Of such like ruffians shun the very sight,

Or you may suffer to thine own despite.â


13. Then to a charming limpid pool he sped

â Canes and rose apples both its banks oâerspread â 
{5.167}

Right glad at heart, no further fear he knew,

But plunged in azure depths was lost to view.
 [5.88]


14. No sooner vanished had the snake, than he

Revealed full clearly his divinity,

In kindly acts he played a filial part,

And with his grateful speeches touched my heart.


15. You dearer than my parents did restore

My life, true friend eâen to your inmost core,

Through you my former bliss has been regained,

Then come, Aá¸·Ära, see where once I reigned,

A dwelling stored with food, like Sakkaâs town

MasakkasÄra, place of high renown.â
 {5.168}

16. âWhat charming spots in my domain are seen,

Soft to the tread and clothed in evergreen!

Nor dust nor gravel in our path we find,

And there do happy souls leave grief behind.


17. âMidst level courts that sapphire walls surround

Fair mango groves on every side abound,

Whereon ripe clusters of rich fruit appear

Through all the changing seasons of the year.
 {5.169}


18. Amidst these groves a fabric wrought of gold

And fixed with silver bolts you may behold,

A dwelling bright in splendour, to outvie

The lightning flash that gleams across the sky.


19. Fashioned with gems and gold, divinely fair,

And decked with paintings manifold and rare,

âTis thronged with nymphs magnificently dressed,

All wearing golden chains upon their breast.


20. Then in hot haste did Saá¹khapÄla climb

The terraced height, on which in power sublime

Uplifted on a thousand piers was seen

The palace of his wedded wife and queen.


21. Quickly anon one of that maiden band

Bearing a precious jewel in her hand,

A turquoise rare with magic power replete,

And all unbidden offered me a seat.


22. The snake then grasped my arm and led me where

There stood a noble and right royal chair,

âPray, let your honour sit here by my side,

As parent dear to me are you,â he cried.


23. A second nymph then quick at his command

Came with a bowl of water in her hand,

And bathed my feet, kind service tendering

As did the queen for her dear lord the king.
 {5.170}


24. Then yet another maiden in a trice

Served in a golden dish some curried rice,

Flavoured with many a sauce, that haply might

With dainty cravings tempt the appetite.


25. With strains of music then â for such they knew

Was their lordâs wish â they fain were to subdue

My will, nor did the king himself eâer fail

My soul with heavenly longings to assail.â
 [5.89]

26. âThree hundred wives, Aá¸·Ära, here have I,

Slim-waisted all, in beauty they outvie

The lotus flower. Behold, they only live

To do your will: accept the boon I give.â

27. âOne year with heavenly pleasures was I blessed

When to the king this question I addressed,

âHow, NÄga, is this palace fair your home,

And how to be your portion did it come?


28. Was this fair place by accident attained,

Wrought by thyself, or gift from Devas gained?

I ask you, NÄga king, the truth to tell,

How did you come in this fair place to dwell?â â

29. â âTwas by no chance or natural law attained,

Not wrought by me, no boon from Devas gained;

But to my own good actions, you must know,

And to my merits these fair halls I owe.â


30. âWhat holy vow, what life so chaste and pure

What store of merit could such bliss secure?

Tell me, O NÄga king, for I am fain

To know how this fair mansion you could gain.â


31. âI once was king of Magadha, my name

Duyyodhana, a prince of mighty fame: 
{5.172}

I held my life as vile and insecure,

Without all power in ripeness to mature.


32. I meat and drink religiously supplied,

And alms bestowed on all, both far and wide,

My house was like an inn, where all that came,

Sages and saints, refreshed their weary frame.


33. Bound by such vows, such was the life I passed,

And such the store of merit I amassed,

Whereby this mansion was at length attained,

And food and drink in ample measure gained.â


34. âThis life, however bright for many a day

With dance and song, yet lasted not for aye,

Weak creatures harry you for all your might

And feeble beings put the strong to flight.

Why, armed to the teeth in such unequal fray,

To those vile beggars should you fall a prey?


35. By what oâermastering dread were you undone?

Where had the virus of your poison gone?

Why, armed to the teeth and powerful as you were,

From such poor creatures did you suffer hurt?â


36. âBy no oâermastering dread was I undone,

Nor could my powers be crushed by any one.

The worth of goodness is by all confessed;

Its bounds, like the sea shore, are neâer transgressed.
 [5.90]


37. Two times each moon I kept a holy day;

âTwas then, Aá¸·Ära, that there crossed my way

Twice eight lewd fellows, bearing in their hand

A rope and knotted noose of finest strand. 
{5.173}


38. The ruffians pierced my nose, and through the slit

Passing the cord, dragged me along by it.

Such pain I had to bear â ah! cruel fate â

For holding holy days inviolate.â


39. âSeeing in that lone path, stretched at full length,

A thing of beauty and enormous strength,

Why, wise and glorious one, I cried, do you

Take on thyself this strict ascetic vow?â


40. âNeither for child nor wealth is my desire

Nor yet to length of days do I aspire;

But âmidst the world of men I fain would live,

And to this end heroically strive.â


41. âWith hair and beard well-trimmed, your sturdy frame

Adorned with gorgeous robes, an eye of flame,

Bathed in red sandal oil you seem to shine

Afar, eâen as some minstrel king divine.


42. With heavenly gifts miraculously blessed

And of whateâer your heart may crave possessed,

I ask you, NÄga king, the truth to tell,

Why do you in manâs world prefer to dwell?â


43. âNowhere but in the world of men, I ween,

May purity and self-restraint be seen:

If only once âmidst men I draw my breath,

Iâll put an end to further birth and death.â


44. âEver supplied with bountiful good cheer,

With you, O king, Iâve sojourned for a year,

Now must I say farewell and flee away,

Absent from home no longer can I stay.â


45. âMy wife and children and our menial band

Are ever trained to wait at your command: 
{5.174}

No one, I trust, has offered you a slight

For dear are you, Aá¸·Ära, to my sight.â


46. âKind parentsâ presence fills a home with joy,

Yet more than they some fondly cherished boy:

But greatest bliss of all have I found here,

For you, O king, have ever held me dear.â


47. âI have a jewel rare with blood-red spot,

That brings great wealth to such as have it not.

Take it and go to thine own home, and when

You have grown rich, pray, send it back again.â
 {5.175}

48. âDesires of man are transient, nor can they

The higher law of ripening change obey:

Seeing what woes from sinful passion spring,

Faith led me on to be ordained, O king.


49. Men fall like fruit, to perish straight away,

All bodies, young and old alike, decay:

In holy orders only find I rest,

The true 
apaá¹á¹aka
, cf. vol. i. p. 95, 
Apaá¹á¹akajÄtaka
.
 and universal is the best.â
 {5.177}

50. âThe wise and learned, such as meditate

On mighty themes, we all should cultivate;

Hearkening, Aá¸·Ära, to NÄga and you,

Lo! I perform all deeds of piety.â

51. âThe wise and learned, such as meditate

On mighty themes, we all should cultivate:

Hearkening, O monarch, to NÄga and me,

Do you perform all deeds of piety.â

The Teacher at the end of this discourse identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the father who became an ascetic was Kassapa, the king of Benares was Änanda, Aá¸·Ära was SÄriputta and Saá¹khapÄla was myself.â

## Full Story
âGood friends.â
 This story the Teacher while residing at Jetavana told concerning the perfect exercise of self-abnegation. The introductory story corresponds with that of the MahÄnÄradakassapajÄtaka [Ja 544].

This story was told by the Teacher... in relation to the conversion of UruvelÄ Kassapa. Now the Teacher by whom the glorious reign of law was begun, after converting the ascetics UruvelÄ Kassapa and the rest, came to the pleasure garden of Laá¹­á¹­hivana, surrounded by the thousand bhikkhus who had before been ascetics, in order to persuade the king of Magadha to give his promise; and at that time, when the Magadha king, who had come with an attending company of twelve myriads, had seated himself after saluting the One with Ten Powers, a dispute arose among the brahmins and householders of his train, âHas UruvelÄ Kassapa placed himself under the spiritual guidance of the great ascetic, or has the great ascetic placed himself under the spiritual guidance of UruvelÄ Kassapa?â Then the Fortunate One thought to himself, âI will show them that Kassapa has placed himself under my spiritual guidance,â and he uttered this verse:

âWhat was it that you saw, O inhabitant of UruvelÄ, that you, renowned for your asceticism, abandoned your sacred fire? I ask you, Kassapa, this question â how is it that your fire sacrifice has been deserted?â

Then the elder, who understood the Buddhaâs purport, replied in this verse:

âThe sacrifices only speak of forms and sounds and tastes, and sensual pleasures and women; and knowing that all these things, being found in the elements of material existence, are filth, I took no more delight in sacrifices or offerings.â

And in order to show that he was a disciple, he laid his head upon the TathÄgataâs feet and said: âThe Fortunate One is my teacher, and I am his disciple.â So saying he rose into the air seven times, to the height of a palm tree, two palm trees, and so on to seven palm trees, and then having come down and saluted the TathÄgata, he sat down on one side.


The great multitude when they saw that miracle uttered the glories of the Teacher, saying: âO great is the power of Buddha; though filled with such a firm conviction of his own, and though he believed himself to be a saint, UruvelÄ Kassapa burst the bonds of error and was converted by the TathÄgata.â The Teacher said: âIt is not wonderful that I who have now attained omniscience should have converted him; in olden time when I was the Brahma named NÄrada and still subject to passion, I burst this manâs bonds of error and made him humble,â and so saying he told the following, at the request of the audience.

1. âGood friends and citizens assembled here,

Hearken, my trusty counsellors, to me,

Now that grey hairs upon my head appear,

Henceforth it is my will a monk to be.â

2. âSuch random 
abhumma,
 out of oneâs range or sphere, unfit, improper.
 words as these in uttering

You make an arrow quiver in my heart:

Remember your seven hundred wives, O king;

What will become of them, should you depart?â

3. âTheir sorrows soon another will console,

For they are young in years and fair to see,

But I am bent upon a heavenly goal

And so right fain am I a monk to be.â

4. âIll-fated was the day, alas, that I

Was hailed as mother to a son like thee,

For heedless of my tears and bitter cry,

You are resolved, O king, a monk to be.


5. Accursed was the day, alas, that I,

O Sutasoma dear, gave birth to thee,

For heedless of my tears and bitter cry,

You are resolved, O king, a monk to be.â

6. âWhat Dhamma is this that makes you become

Eager to quit your kingdom and your home?

With your old parents left behind to dwell

Here all alone, seek you an asceticâs cell?â

7. âBut you have many a child, I ween,

And all of tender years,

When you no longer may be seen,

What sorrow will be theirs!â

8. âYes, I have many a child, I ween,

Of tender years are they,

With them full long though I have been,

I now must part for aye.â

9. âYour heart in sorrow, sure, must break

Or pity is to you unknown,

That you can holy orders take,

And leave us here to weep alone.â

10. âMy heart in sorrow may not break,

Though I feel pity for your pain, 
[5.181]

But holy orders I must take,

That I may heavenly bliss attain.â

11. âIll-fated was the day, alas, that I

O Sutasoma dear, espousÃ©d thee,

For heedless of my tears and bitter cry

You are resolved, O king, a monk to be.


12. Accursed was the day, alas, that I

O Sutasoma dear, espousÃ©d thee,

For you would leave me in my throes to die,

Determined as you are a monk to be.


13. The hour of my delivery is nigh,

And I would fain my lord should stay with me

Until my child is born, before that I

See the sad day that I am reft of you.â

14. âThe hour of your delivery is nigh,

Until the babe is born, Iâll stay with thee, 
{5.182}

Then will I leave the royal imp and fly

Far from the world a holy monk to be.â

15. âMy queen, with eye like ebon flower,

Dear CandÄ, weep not you for me,

But climb once more your palace tower:

I go without one care for thee.â

16. âWho has annoyed you, mother dear,

Why do you weep and stare at me?

Whom of my kin that I see here

Must I, all impious, slay for thee?â

17. âNo harm, dear son, may touch his head,

Who lives to work such woe for me: 
{5.183}

For know it was your sire who said,

I go without one care for thee.â

18. âI who once ranged the park to see

Wild elephants engage in fight,

If my dear sire a monk should be,

What should I do, poor luckless wight?â

19. âMy mother, lo! is weeping and

My brother fain would keep you still,

I too will hold you by the hand

Nor let you go against our will.â

20. âUp nurse and let the little boy

Disport him in some other place,

Lest haply he should mar my joy

And hinder my heavenward race.â

21. âWhat now if I reject outright

â I need it not â this jewel bright?

For should my lord an ascetic be,

What use would jewels be to me?â

22. âYour coffers filled with treasure vast,

Great wealth have you, O king, amassed:

The world is all subdued by thee,

Take you your ease; no ascetic be.â

23. âMy coffers filled with treasures vast,

Great wealth has been by me amassed:

The whole world is subdued by me;

I leave it all a monk to be.â 
{5.185}

24. âGreat wealth have I, O king, amassed,

Beyond all power of reckoning vast:

Behold I give it all to thee,

Take you your ease; no ascetic be.â 
[5.96]

25. âO Kulavaddhana, I know,

Your wealth on me you would bestow,

But I a heavenly goal would win,

So I renounce this world of sin.â

26. âO Somadatta, sure I feel

Strange loathing oâer my senses steal

At the thought of my defilements:

Today my ascetic life begins.â

27. âDear Sutasoma, go and dwell

As pleaseth you in ascetic cell;

I too an ascetic fain would be,

For life were nought apart from thee.â

28a. âYou may not go, or through the land

Home life would all come to a stand.â 
Lit. âThere is no cooking,â or as the commentary explains, âno one kindles a fire in the oven.â
 
{5.186}

28b. âShould Sutasoma go away,

What would become of us, we pray?â

29. âLike water through a sieve, 
caá¹gavÄra.
 The word is rendered by Rhys Davids in 
MilindapaÃ±hÄ
 ii. p. 278 (S.B.E.) as âdyersâ straining-cloth.â cf. MN i. 144, and Neumannâs translation i. p. 239, where he renders it

So brief, alas, fast slips away:

With life thus circumscribed, I ween,

No room for carelessness is seen.


30. Like water through a sieve, our day

So brief, alas, fast slips away:

With life thus circumscribed all round,

Only the fool is careless found.


31. Bound fast by sensual desires, wherein they fell,

Such men enlarge the bounds of hell,

Crowd the brute world and realm of ghosts,

And multiply Asura hosts.â
 [5.97] {5.187}

32. âThat cloud of dust see how it towers

Hard by the royal House of Flowers;

Famed king of right, I think, our lord

Has shorn his locks off with a sword.â

33-34. âHere 
It seems unnecessary to translate all the sixteen verses in the text, differing, as they do, from one another for the most part by a single word, usually the name of a tree or flower.
 are his golden palace-towers

All hung with wreaths of scented flowers,

Where girt with many a lady fair

Our king would oftentimes repair.


35-36. Here wreathed with flowers and wrought of gold

His gabled-hall one may behold,

Where, all his kinsfolk by his side,

Our king would range in all his pride.
 [5.98]


39-40. This is his garden bright with flowers

Through all the seasonâs changing hours,

Where girt with many a lady fair

Our king would oftentimes repair.


47-48. His lake oâerspread with lotus blue,

Haunt of wild birds, here comes in view,

Where, all his kinsfolk by his side,

Our king would range in all his pride.â
 {5.190}

49. âKing Sutasoma, sad to tell,

Has left his throne for ascetic cell,

And, clad in yellow, goes his way

Like some lone elephant astray.â

50. âCall not to mind loveâs sports of yore

While still a smiling face you wore,

Lest that fair city of delight

Should waken lust and slay you quite.


51. Indulge without or stint or stay

Good will to men by night and day,

So shall you win the angel home

Where all that do good deeds shall come.â
 [5.99] {5.192}

The Teacher having concluded this discourse said: âNot only now, monks, but formerly also the TathÄgata made the Great Renunciation,â and he identified the JÄtaka. âAt that time the father and mother were members of the great kingâs Court, CandÄ was the mother of RÄhula, the elder son was SÄriputta, the younger son was RÄhula, the nurse was KhujjuttarÄ, Kulavaddhana, the rich merchant, was Kassapa, the commander-in-chief was MoggallÄna, prince Somadatta was Änanda, king Sutasoma was myself.â

In the present one monk thinks to return to the lay life because of his attraction to his former wife. The Buddha tells a story of how Sakka feared one holy ascetic would displace him, and so sent a drought on the country and then told the king to send his daughter to break the asceticâs virtue, which she did. When his father returned and admonished him he regained his Super Knowledges.


The Bodhisatta = the (ascetic) father (pitÄ),

## Full Story
âThe country is dried up.â 
{5.193}
 Now while the Teacher was living in Jetaâs Wood he told this about the seductions of a former wife. And in regard to this story, he asked the monk what was the cause of his dissatisfaction, and he said: âIt is because of my former wife.â


âMonk, this one has been unbeneficial to you in the past also, and having lost the absorptions because of her, you came to a great calamity,â and after saying that he told a story about the past.

1. âThe country is dried up, and the kingdom will be destroyed,

Come, Naá¸·inikÄ, do you go and bring the brahmin for me.â 
Both the King and the daughter are seen to be acting in good faith in order to save the Kingdom, so this is by no means a simple seduction story.

2. âI cannot bear suffering, king, and I have no skill in roads,

How will I go through a wood inhabited by elephants?â

3. âYou can go through this prosperous country with an elephant and a chariot,

And with a wooden raft - you can go like this, Naá¸·inikÄ. 
{5.195}


4. Go and take with you elephants, horses, soldiers and nobles,

By your beauteous form you will bring him under your control.â

5. âMarked by the sign of the plantain, surrounded by the HimÄlayan birch, 
The 
bhÅ«rja
 or 
bhojpatr
, which is also known in English as the Himalayan birch or Jacquemon tree, 
Betula utilis D.Don
.

Here is seen Isisiá¹gaâs delightful hermitage.


6. Here is seen the smoke of a fire,

I think it is emitted from the very powerful Isisiá¹gaâs sacred fire.

7. âHaving seen her coming, adorned with jewelled earrings,

Isisiá¹ga fearfully entered the leaf-covered hermitage.


8. She amused herself with her yo-yo at the door of the hermitage,

Revealing her limbs, she displayed her secret parts.


9. After seeing the yogini amusing herself with the yo-yo at the leaf-hut, 

And coming forth from the hermitage, he spoke these words:


10. âHey! What is the name of the tree such a fruit comes from?

Having thrown it afar it returns, it doesnât go away from you.â â

11. âMy hermitage, holy sir, is close to GandhamÄdana, 
The name of a mountain in the HimÄlayas, the exact location of which is unclear; the name means 
intoxicating with its fragrance
.

There are trees on the mountain that such a fruit comes from,

Having thrown it afar it returns, it doesnât go away from me.â 
{5.197}

12. âCome, good sir, eat in this hermitage,

Receive what I can give of foot-oil and food,

Please sit, good sir, here in this hermitage,

Eat, good Sir, the roots and fruits.â

13. âWhat is this in between your thighs

It appears so dark and slippery,

Declare to me that which I ask about,

Why is it your genitals enter into a cavity?â

14. âWhile I was roaming in the woods is search of roots and fruits,

I came across a bear, very fierce in appearance, 
{5.198}

He ran up and fell upon me with violence,

He pushed me down and pulled off my penis.


15. This wound is therefore itching and irritating,

I do not receive any comfort at any time,

You are able, good sir, to remove this itch,

When asked, dear sir, please do this good thing for a brahmin.

16. âYour wound appears to be deep and red,

It is big, fresh and smells like itâs decaying,

I will make you some remedial decoction,

Like that, good sir, you will be at perfect ease.â

17. âNot through a charm-remedy, or a remedial decoction,

Nor through medicine, holy one, will the itch go away, 

Please remove the itch gently with your penis,

Like that I will come to be at perfect ease.â 
{5.199}

18. âFrom here, good sir, where is your hermitage?

Do you, good sir, take delight in the wilds?

Do you have abundant roots and fruits?

Do you, good sir, not risk injury from predators?

19. âFrom here straight in the northerly direction.

The river KhemÄ moves through the HimÄlayas ,

On the bank of that river is my delightful hermitage,

If you like, good sir, you can come and see my hermitage.


20. Mango, sal, plum, and jambolan trees,

The cassia, and the blossoming trumpet-flower tree, 

All around the bird-men sing,

If you like, good sir, you can come and see my hermitage.


21. There are palmyra and roots and fruits for me,

Well-endowed with beauty and good scent, 
{5.200}

That portion of the land is indeed well-endowed,

If you like, good sir, you can come and see my hermitage.


22. Abundant roots and fruits are there,

Endowed with beauty, scent and taste,

But when hunters come to that district I say:

Do not take from here my roots and fruits.â

23. âMy father has gone searching for roots and fruits,

He will return here at evening time,

We both can go to your hermitage then,

After father has come back from collecting roots and fruits.â

24. âThere are many other well-disposed sages,

Royal sages, living along the road, 

Please ask them about my hermitage,

They will guide you to my neighbourhood.â

25. âYou have not broken firewood, you have not brought the water,

You have not attended to the fire, what are you thinking of, lazy one?


26. Broken firewood and the sacrificial fire,

You, an ascetic, peacefully living the holy life,

Preparing my stool and setting up water -

Previously you delighted in excellence.


27. But now you have not broken firewood, you have not brought the water,

You have neglected the fire, and the food is not ready,

And today you do not converse with me,

Why are you wasting away and suffering? 
{5.202}

28. âThere came here a yogi, a holy one,

Very beautiful, slender, he leads,

Neither too tall nor too short,

That venerable one had very black hair.


29. Being beardless and youthful,

On his neck was something shaped like our support bowl,

With two bumps on his blessed chest,

Like resplendent golden globules.


30. His face was very beautiful,

Having ears hanging down with curled tips,

Which glittered when that youth walked around,

As did the well-fastened bun of locks on his head.


31. Also he had four fastenings,

Blue, yellow, red and white,

Which flew about when that youth walked around,

Like a flock of parrots in the rainy season.


32. He does not wear a girdle made of grass,

It is no normal covering for the ascetic, 
{5.203}

It glitters, while clinging between his buttocks, 

Like flashes of lightning in the firmament.


33. Without thistles and without stalks, 
Both of these words are obscure and therefore the meaning is unclear. PED (s.v. 
vaá¹á¹­a
): 
avaá¹á¹­a
 (of 
thana
, the breast of a woman) not on a stalk (i. e. well-formed, plump).

Beneath the navel, around his waist,

Without striking them they always play,

Dear Father, the fruit of what tree are these?


34. His locks are very beautiful,

Having many sweet-smelling curls on top,

The two sides of his head were divided in a lovely fashion,

Oh, that my locks might be like that!


35. But when his locks fall down,

They are endowed with a beautiful scent,

Like a blue lotus pervading the wind,

So this hermitage is perfumed by his hair.


36. Even the dust of his body is very beautiful,

The dust on my body is not of such a kind,

He emits a perfume bestirred by the wind,

Like a blossoming wood at the height of the hot season.


37. He throws the fruit of a tree upon the earth,

Having a good form, pleasant and beautiful,

Thrown it comes back to his hand,

Dear Father, what sort of fruit is that?


38. His teeth are very beautiful,

Pure, even and like noble pearls,

They gladden the mind when uncovered,

Does he not eat vegetables with them?


39. Smooth, flowing, swift and soft,

Straight, not haughty or fickle was his speech, 
{5.204}

His cry was pleasant like the sweet sound of the cuckoo,

Stirring the heart, it surely delights my mind.


40. A full sound, not speaking too much,

Surely not applied to study of the texts,

I desire to see him again and again,

That young man, whom I called my friend.


41. He had a wound that was very smooth of all sides,

Broad, well-made, looking like a wet leaf,

With that the youth, having covered me over,

Pressed down his open thighs with his buttocks.


42. Shining, bedazzling and illuminating,

Like flashes of lightning in the firmament.

His soft arms had glossy down,

His beautiful round fingers were resplendent.


43. Having smooth limbs, and short bodily hair,

His long fingernails were red at the tips,

Embracing me with his soft arms,

Beautiful, delighting, he attended to me.


44. Like the cotton of trees, resplendent,

Having very golden palms, round and beautiful skin,

Having been touched by those soft hands,

Though he has gone from here, Father, they still torment me.


45. He surely did not carry a pole and basket, 

He surely did not break his firewood,

He surely did not cut down a tree with an axe,

There were no callouses on his hands.


46. A bear had caused his wound,

He said to me: please make me happy, 
{5.205}

What I did for him was my pleasure,

And he said: I am happy, pious one.


47. This rug made with creeper leaves

Is scattered all about by me and by him.

Then weary, after delighting in the water,

We ran back again to the leaf-hut.


48. Father, today we did not recite the mantras,

Nor offer the fire-sacrifice, nor the extended sacrifice, 
SED: 
yajÃ±Ã¡-tantra
, n. extension of a sacrifice
.

Nor can I eat those roots and fruits,

Until I see that Holy One again.


49. For sure you will know, Father,

In what place that holy one lives,

Let me go quickly to that place, Father,

Do not let me die in your hermitage!


50. The wood has beautiful blossoms, I have heard,

Resounding with birds, inhabited by flocks of birds,

Let me go quickly to that wood, father,

Before I forsake my life in this hermitage.

51. âIn this resplendent wood,

Inhabited by heavenly musicians, gods and angels, 
{5.208}

Where the sages are always dwelling,

You must not become discontent.


52. Some are friends, and then some are not,

They have love for your relatives and friends,

But this one is contemptible: he who does not know, 

For whom there should be devotion, or from whence he came. 
I.e. one who does not know his lineage, which was the way to establish his status in ancient India.


53. Through living together friends are connected again and again,

That friend who is not met with, through non-association is destroyed.


54. If you will see this holy one again,

If you will talk with this holy one again,

Just as a successful harvest by the great waters,

So this ascetic virtue will be quickly taken away.


55. If you will see this holy one again,

If you will talk with this holy one again,

Just as a successful harvest by the great waters,

So this power will be quickly taken away.


56. There are beings, dear, living in this

World of men having different forms,

A wise man does not associate with them,

Through contact with them the holy life is destroyed.â

After giving this Dhamma teaching, and showing the Truths, he made the connection and at the conclusion of the Truths that dissatisfied monk was established in the fruition of Stream-Entry.


The Buddha said: at that time Naá¸·inikÄ was his former wife, Isisiá¹ga was the dissatisfied monk, and I was the Father.

âWhose house is this.â
 
[5.107]
 This story the Teacher, while residing at Jetavana, told about a discontented monk. The story tells that one day, as he was going his rounds in SÄvatthi for alms, he saw a woman of surpassing beauty, magnificently attired, and fell in love with her, and on returning home to his monastery he was unable to divert his thoughts from her. From that time, as it were, pierced with loveâs shafts and sick with desire he became as lean as a wild deer, with his veins standing out on his body, and as sallow as sallow could be. He no longer took delight in any one of the four postures, or found pleasure in his own thoughts, but giving up all the services due to a teacher he abandoned the use of instruction, inquiry and meditation.


His fellow-monks said: âSir, once you were calm in mind and serene of countenance, but now it is not so. 
{5.210}
 What can be the cause?â they asked. âSirs,â he answered, âI have no pleasure in anything.â Then they bade him be happy, saying: âTo be born in the time of a Buddha is a hard matter: so also is the hearing of the True Dhamma, and the attaining to birth as a human being. But you have attained to this, and, yearning to put an end to sorrow, you left your weeping kinsfolk and becoming a believer adopted the ascetic life.


Why then do you now fall under the sway of passion? These evil passions are common to all ignorant creatures, from live worms upwards, and such of these passions as are material in their origin, they too are insipid. Desires are full of sorrow and despair: misery in this case ever increases more and more. Desire is like a skeleton or a piece of meat. Desire is like a torch made of a wisp of hay or a light from embers. Desire vanishes like a dream or a loan, or the fruit of a tree. Desire is as biting as a sharp-pointed spear, or as a serpentâs head. But you, verily, after embracing such a Buddhaâs dispensation as this and becoming an ascetic, have now fallen under the sway of such harmful passions.â


When by their admonitions they failed to make him grasp their teaching, they brought him before the Teacher in the Dhamma Hall. And when he said: âWhy, monks, have you brought this monk here against his will?â they answered, âThey tell us, he is discontent.â The Teacher asked if it were true, and on his confessing that it was so, the Teacher said: âMonk, sages of old, though ruling a kingdom, whenever lust sprang up in their hearts, passed under its sway for a time, but checked their roving thoughts and were guilty of no improper conduct.â And with these words he related a story of the past.

1. âWhose house is this, Sunanda, tell me true,

All girt about with wall of golden hue?

What vision fair is this, like meteor bright,

Or sunbeam striking on some mountain height?


2. A daughter of the house perchance is she,

Herself its mistress, or sonâs wife maybe?

Your answer quickly in a single word â

Is she unwed, 
avÄvaá¹­a,
 i.e. 
avyÄvá¹ita,
 not chosen in marriage.
 or owns she still a lord?â
 {5.214}

3. âAll that your highness asks I know full well,

And of her parents on both sides can tell:

As to her husband, night and day, O king,

He serves your cause with zeal in everything.


4. A powerful minister of thine is he,

Vast wealth he owns and great prosperity;

Sheâs wife of AhipÄraka the famed,

And at her birth was UmmadantÄ« named.â

5. âAlas, how ominous a name is here

Given to this maiden by her parents dear;

Since UmmadantÄ« fixed her gaze on me,

Lo! A mad haunted man I grew to be.â

6. âA lily maid, with eyes soft as a doeâs,

In the full moonâs clear light before me rose,

Beholding her in robe of dove-like hue,

I thought two moons at once came into view.


7. Darting one glance from her bright, lovely eyes,

The temptress took me captive by surprise,

Like Kimpurisa upon some mountain height,

Her graceful motion won my heart at sight.
 [5.111]


8. So dark and tall and fair the maid, with jewels in her ears,

Clad in a single garment, like a timid doe, appears.


9. With long-tressed hair and nails all stainÃ©d red,

Oâer her soft arms rich sandal essence shed,

With tapering fingers and a gracious air,

When will she smile on me, my charmer fair?


10. When will TirÄ«á¹­iâs slender-waisted maid,

A gold adornment on her breast displayed,

With her soft arms embracing cling to me,

Eâen as a creeper to some forest tree?


11. When will she stained with dye of lac so bright,

With swelling bosom, maiden lily-white,

Exchange a kiss with me, as oft a glass

Will from one drunkard to another pass?


12. Soon as I saw her standing thus, so fair to outward view,

No longer master of myself, reason away I threw.


13. When UmmadantÄ« I beheld, with jewelled earrings bright,

Like one punished right heavily, I slept not day nor night.
 {5.216}


14. Should Sakka grant a boon to me, my choice were quickly taâen,

I would be AhipÄraka one night or haply twain,

And UmmadantÄ« thus enjoyed, he might oâer Sivi reign.â

15. âWhile kneeling at a sacred shrine, O king,

A Yakkha came and told me a strange thing,

How UmmadantÄ« had enslaved your will:

Take her and so your heartâs desire fulfil.â

16. âFallen from grace no godhead shall I win,

And all the world will hear of my great wrong:

Think too how great your grief of mind would be,

Should you no more your UmmadantÄ« see.â

17. âExcept thyself and me, O king, no one

In the whole world will know the deed thatâs done:

Lo! UmmadantÄ« is my gift to you,

Your passion sated, send her back to me.â


18. âThe sinner thinks, âNo mortal man has been

A witness of my guilty deed,â I ween, 
{5.219}

Yet all he does will fall within the ken

Of ghostly beings and of holy men.â


19. Who in this world, supposing you should say,

I loved her not, would any credence pay?

Think too how great your grief of mind would be,

Should you no more your UmmadantÄ« see.â


20. âShe was, great king, as dear to me as life,

In very truth a well-belovÃ©d wife;

Yet, sire, to UmmadantÄ« straight repair,

Eâen as a lion to his rocky lair.â


21. âThe sage howeâer oppressed by his own woe,

Will scarce an act that wins him bliss forego,

Eâen the dull fool intoxicate with bliss

Would neâer be guilty of a wrong like this.â
 [5.113]


22. âA fostering parent, king, I own in you,

Husband and lord, yes god are you to me,

Your slaves my wife and child, and I your thrall,

O Sivi, do your pleasure with us all.â


23. âWhoso shall wrong his neighbour nor repent,

Saying, âSee here a lord omnipotent,â

Will neâer be found to live out half his days,

And gods will view his conduct with dispraise.â


24. âShould righteous men accept as gift a thing

Freely bestowed by others, then, O king,

They who receive and they who grant have done

A deed whereby the fruit of bliss is won.â


25. âWho in this world, supposing you should say,

I love her not, would any credence pay? 
{5.220}

Think too how great your grief of mind would be,

Should you no more your UmmadantÄ« see.â


26. âShe was, great king, as dear to me as life,

In very truth a well-belovÃ©d wife;

Lo! UmmadantÄ« is my gift to you,

Your passion sated, send her back to me.â


27. âWho rids himself of pain at othersâ cost,

Rejoicing still though othersâ joy be lost,

Not he, but one that feels anotherâs woe

As âtwere his own, true righteousness can know.â


28. Who in this world, supposing you should say,

I loved her not, would any credence pay?

Think too how great your grief of mind would be,

Should you no more your UmmadantÄ« see.â


29. âShe was, great king, as dear to me as life,

In very truth a well-belovÃ©d wife,

I give what most I prize, nor give in vain,

They that thus give receive as much again.â


30. âI might destroy myself for fleshly appetite,

Yet would I never dare by wrong destroy the right.â


31. âShould you, O noble prince, your love foreswear

Because she is my wife, lo! I declare

Henceforth she is divorced and free to all,

Your slave to summon at your beck and call.â


32. âIf you, my minister, 
KattÄ, a kingâs minister or officer. cf. JÄtaka vi. 259, 24, 268, 6, and 313, 22. The commentary explains the word as âa doer of such things as ought to be done.â Compare the use of Îµá½ÎµÏÎ³á½³ÏÎ·Ï [benefactor] as a title of honour, Hdt. viii. 85.
 to your detriment,

Should put away your wife, though innocent,

You would, I think, have heavy blame to bear

And neâer a single soul to speak you fair.â


33. âWith all such blame, my king, I could away,

With censure, praise, or be it what it may,

Let it fall on me, Sivi, as it will,

Only do you your pleasure first fulfil.â
 {5.221}




34. âHe who esteem or blame regardeth not,

For praise or censure careth not a jot â

From him will glory and good fortune fly,

As floods subside, leaving land high and dry.â


35. âWhateâer of bliss or pain from hence may spring,

Oâerstepping right, or fit oneâs heart to wring,

Iâll welcome, if it joyous be or sad,

As Earth puts up with all, both good and bad.â
 [5.114]




36. âI would not have another suffering

From wrongful act that may his bosom wring,

Iâll bear the burden of my griefs alone,

Steadfast in right, vexing the peace of none.â


37. âA meritorious act to heaven will lead,

Be that no obstacle to such a deed;

I UmmadantÄ« a free offering send,

As kings on brahmin priests much treasure spend.â


38. âTruly to me great kindness have you shown,

Your wife and you are both my friends, I own,

Brahmins and gods alike would blame me sore,

And curses rest on me for evermore.â


39. âTownsmen and countryfolk in this, I trust,

Will neâer, O Sivi king, call you unjust,

Since UmmadantÄ« is my gift to you,

Your passion sated, send her back to me.â


40. âTruly to me great kindness have you shown,

You and your wife are both my friends, I own,

Good menâs right acts are famed both far and wide,

Hard to oâerstep is right, like oceanâs tide.â


41. âWorshipful master, waiting to bestow

Whateâer I crave, kind benefactor, thou 
{5.222}

Repayest sevenfold all I offer thee;

Take UmmadantÄ«; my free gift is she.â


42. âMinister AhipÄraka, in truth,

Right have you followed, even from your youth;

Who else of living men, I pray you, would

Early and late have striven to do me good?â


43. âO noble prince, you are of peerless fame,

Wise, knowing right and walking in the same,

Shielded by right, may you, O king, live long,

And, lord of right, teach me to shun the wrong.â


44. âCome, hearken, AhipÄraka, to these my words and then

Iâll teach you ways of righteousness as practised by good men:


45. A king delighting in Dhamma is blessed,

And of all men a learned one is best,

Neâer to betray a friend is good, I wis,

But evil to eschew is perfect bliss.


46. âNeath the mild sway of righteous king,

Like shade from sun-stroke sheltering,

His subjects all may dwell in peace,

Rejoicing in their wealthâs increase.


47. No evil deed shall my approval win,

However heedless it remains a wrong:

But that wrong against knowledge I detest;

List to my parable; mark it and digest.


48. The bull 
[See Ja 334 RÄjovÄdajÄtaka.]
 through floods a devious course will take,

The herd of kine all straggling in his wake.


49. So if a leader tortuous paths pursue,

To base ends will he guide the vulgar crew,

And the whole realm an age of license rue.
 [5.115]




50. But if the bull a course direct shall steer,

The herd of kine straight follow in his rear.


51. So should their chief to righteous ways be true,

The common folk injustice will eschew,

And through the realm shall holy peace ensue. 
{5.223}




52. I would not by an unjust act eâen heaven itself attain,

No, not if, AhipÄraka, the whole world I should gain.


53. Whatever things of price âmongst men esteemÃ©d good,

Oxen and slaves and gold, garments and sandalwood,


54. Brood mares, rich treasure, jewels bright

And all that sun and moon watch over day and night,

Not for all this would I injustice do,

I amongst Sivis born, a leader true.


55. Father and chief and guardian of our land,

As champion of its rights I take my stand,

So will I reign on righteousness intent,

To mine own will no more subservient.â


56. âAuspicious is your rule, great king, may you continue long

To guide the state with happy fate and in your wisdom strong.


57. Great joy is ours, O king, that you such zeal for right have shown,

Princes of might, neglecting right, ere now have lost a crown.


58. To parents 
[See Ja 501 RohantamigajÄtaka.]
 dear, O warrior king, do righteously; and so

By following a righteous line to heaven you, sire, shall go.


59. To wife and children, warrior king, do righteously; and so

By following a righteous line to heaven you, sire, shall go.


60. To friends and courtiers, warrior king, do righteously; and so

By following a righteous line to heaven you, sire, shall go.


61. In war and travel, warrior king, do righteously; and so

By following a righteous line to heaven you, sire, shall go.


62. In town and village, warrior king, do righteously; and so

By following a righteous line to heaven you, sire, shall go.


63. In every land and realm, O king, do righteously; and so

By following a righteous line to heaven you, sire, shall go.


64. To brahmins and ascetics all, do righteously; and so

By following a righteous line to heaven you, sire, shall go.


65. To beasts and birds, O warrior king, do righteously; and so

By following a righteous line to heaven you, sire, shall go.


66. Do righteously, O warrior king; from this all blessings flow;

By following a righteous course to heaven you, sire, shall go.


67. With watchful vigilance, O king, on paths of goodness go:

The brahmins, Sakka, and the gods have won their godhead so.â
 {5.227}

The Teacher, having ended his lesson, revealed the Truths, and identified the JÄtaka. At the end of the Truths the monk was established in the First Path. At that time Änanda was the charioteer Sunanda, SÄriputta was AhipÄraka, Uppalavaá¹á¹Ä was UmmadantÄ«, the followers of Buddha were the rest of the courtiers, and I myself was king Sivi.

## Full Story
âWhat mean, these things.â
 
[5.116]
 This story the Teacher, while residing at Jetavana, told concerning the Perfection of Wisdom. The incident will be found related in the MahÄ-ummagga [Ja 546].

One day the monks sat in the Dhamma Hall and described the TathÄgataâs Perfection of Wisdom, âMonks, the TathÄgata is greatly wise, his wisdom is vast, ready, swift, sharp, crushing heretical doctrines, after having converted, by the power of his own knowledge, the brahmins KÅ«á¹­adanta and the rest, the ascetics Sabhiya and the rest, the thieves Aá¹gulimÄla and the rest, the Yakkhas Äá¸·avaka and the rest, the Devas Sakka and the rest, and the Brahmas Baka and the rest, made them humble, and ordained a vast multitude as ascetics and established them in the fruition of the paths of sanctification.â

Now on this occasion the Teacher said: âNot only now, but formerly also, the TathÄgata was wise and crushed all disputants,â and with these words he told a story of the past.

1. âWhat mean these things, umbrella, shoes, skin-robe and staff in hand?

What of this cloak and bowl and hook? I fain would understand

Why in hot haste you would depart and to what far-off land.â

2. âThese twelve long years Iâve dwelt, O king, within your royal park;

And never once before today this hound was known to bark.


3. Today he shows his teeth so white, defiant now and proud,

And hearing what you told the queen, to warn me, bays aloud.â 
[5.120]

4. âThe wrong was mine: you, venerable sir, my purpose was to slay;

But now I favour you once more, and fain would have you stay.â

5. âMy food of old was pure and white, next motley âtwas in hue,

Now it is brown as brown can be â âtis time that I withdrew.


6. First on the dais, then upstairs and last below I dine;

Before Iâm thrust out on my neck, my place I will resign.


7. Affect you not a faithless friend: like a dry well is he

However deep one digs it out, the stream will muddy be.


8. A faithful friend sure cultivate, a faithless one eschew,

As one athirst hastes to a pool, a faithful friend pursue.


9. Cling to the friend that clings to you, his love with love requite;

One who forsakes a faithful friend is deemed a sorry wight.


10. Who cleaves not to a steadfast friend, nor love requites with love,

Vilest of men is he, nor ranks the monkey tribe above.


11. To meet too often is as bad as not to meet at all;

To ask a boon a whit too soon â this too makes love to pall.


12. Visit a friend but not too oft, nor yet prolong your stay;

At the right moment favours beg: so love will neâer decay.


13. Who stay too long find oftentimes that friend is changed to foe;

So ere I lose your friendship I will take my leave and go.â
 {5.234}

14. âThough I with folded hands beseech, you will not lend an ear,

You have no word for us to whom your service would be dear,

I crave one favour: come again and pay a visit here.â

15. âIf nothing comes to snap our life, O king, if you and I

Still live, O fosterer of your realm, perhaps Iâll hither fly,

And we may see each other yet, as days and nights go by.â 
{5.235}

16. âIf this your creed, âAll acts of men, or good or base,

From natural causes spring,â I hold, in every case,

Where in involuntary acts can wrong find place?


17. If such the creed you hold and this be Dhamma true,

Then was my action right when I that monkey slew.


18. Could you but only see how sinful is your creed,

You would no longer then with reason blame my deed.â
 {5.238}

19. âIf there exists some Lord all powerful to fulfil

In every creature bliss or woe, and action good or ill,

That Lord is stained with wrong. Man does but work his will.


20. If such the creed you hold and this be Dhamma true,

Then was my action right when I that monkey slew.
 [5.123]


21. Could you but only see how sinful is your creed,

You would no longer then with reason blame my deed.â

22. âFrom former action still both bliss and woe begin;

This monkey pays his debt, to wit, his former wrong:

Each actâs a debt discharged. Where then does guilt come in? 
{5.239}


23. If such the creed you hold and this be Dhamma true,

Then was my action right when I that monkey slew.


24. Could you but only see how sinful is your creed,

You would no longer then with reason blame my deed.â

25. âEach living creatureâs form four elements compose;

To these component parts dissolved each body goes.


26. The dead exist no more, the living still live on;

Should this world be destroyed, both wise and fools are gone:

Amidst a ruined world guilt-stain defileth none.


27. If such the creed you hold and this be Dhamma true,

Then was my action right when I that monkey slew.


28. Could you but only see how sinful is your creed,

You would no longer then with reason blame my deed.â
 {5.240}

29. âThe Khattiyas say, poor simple fools that think themselves so wise,

A man may kill his parents, if occasion justifies,

Or elder brother, children, wife, should need of it arise.â

30. âFrom off a tree beneath whose shade a man would sit and rest,

âTwere treachery to lop a branch. False friends we both detest. 
[5.124]


31. But if occasion should arise, then extirpate that tree.

That monkey then, to serve my needs, was rightly slain by me.


32. If such the creed you hold and this be Dhamma true,

Then was my action right when I that monkey slew.


33. Could you but only see how sinful is your creed,

You would no longer then with reason blame my deed.â
 {5.241}

34. âThis man avers, âThere is no causeâ. Another, âOne is Lord of allâ.

Some hold, âEach deed was done of oldâ. Others, âAll worlds to ruin fallâ.


35. These and the Khattiya heretics are fools who think that they are wise,

Bad men are they who do wrong themselves and others wickedly advise,

Evil communications aye result in pains and penalties.â

36. âA wolf disguised as ram of old

Drew unsuspected nigh the fold.

The panic-stricken 
Reading 
vittÄsayitvÄ
 for 
citrÄsayitvÄ
.
 flock it slew,

Then scampered off to pastures new.


37. Thus monks and brahmins often use

A cloak, the credulous to abuse.

Some on bare ground all dirty lie,

Some fast, some squat in agony.
 {5.242}

Some may not drink, some eat by rule,

As saint each poses, wicked fool.


38. An evil race of men are they, and fools who think that they are wise,

All such not only wrong themselves, but others wickedly advise,

Evil communications aye result in pains and penalties.


39. Who say, âNo force exists in anything,â

Deny the cause of all, disparaging

Their own and othersâ acts as vanity, O king,


40. An evil race of men are they, and fools who think that they are wise,

All such not only wrong themselves, but others wickedly advise,

Evil communications aye result in pains and penalties.


41. If force exists not anywhere nor acts be good or ill,

Why should a king keep artisans, to profit by their skill?


42. It is because force does exist and actions good or ill,

That kings keep ever artisans and profit by their skill.
 [5.125]


43. If for a hundred years or more no rain or snow should fall,

Our race, amidst a ruined world, would perish one and all.


44. But as rains fall and snow withal, the changing year ensures,

That harvest ripens and our land for ages long endures.


45. The bull 
[See Ja 334 
RÄjovÄdajÄtaka
 verses 48-51.]
 through floods a devious course will take,

The herd of cows all straggling in his wake:


46. So if a leader tortuous paths pursue,

To base ends will he guide the vulgar crew,

And the whole realm an age of license rue.


47. But if the bull a course direct should steer,

The herd of cows straight follow in his rear.


48. So should their chief to righteous ways be true,

The common folk injustice will eschew,

And through the realm shall holy peace ensue.


49. Who plucketh fruit before it has well ripened on the tree,

Destroys its seed and never knows how sweet the fruit may be.
 {5.243}


50. So he that by unrighteous rule his country has destroyed,

The sweets that spring from righteousness has never once enjoyed.


51. But he that lets the fruit he plucks first ripen on the tree,

Preserves its seed and knows full well how sweet the fruit may be.


52. So he too by his righteous rule that has preserved the land,

How sweet the fruits of justice are can fully understand.


53. The warrior king that oâer the land unrighteous sway shall wield

Will suffer loss in plant and herb, whateâer the ground shall yield.


54. So should he spoil his citizens so apt by trade to gain,

A failing source of revenue will his exchequer drain.


55. And should he vex his soldiers bold, so skilled to rule the fight,

His army will fall off from him and shear him of his might.


56. So should he wrong or sage or saint, he meets his due reward,

And through his wrong, howeâer high born, from heaven will be debarred.


57. And should a wife by wicked king, though innocent, be slain,

He suffers in his children and in hell is racked with pain.


58. Be just to town and country folk and treat your soldiers well,

Be kind to wife and children and let saints in safety dwell.


59. A monarch such as this, O sire, if free from passion found,

Like Sakka, lord of Asuras, strikes terror all around.â
 {5.245}

The Teacher here ended his lesson and saying: âNot only now, monks, but formerly also, the TathÄgata was wise and crushed all disputants,â he thus identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the five heretics

In the present the monks are talking about the Bodhisattaâs renunciation. The Buddha tells a story of two childhood friends, one of whom became a king, and the other a Paccekabuddha. Years later the Paccekabuddha returned and taught the king, who renounced the world and gave over his kingdom to his son.


The Bodhisatta = king Arindama (ArindamarÄjÄ),

the young RÄhula = (his) son (putta),

the Buddhaâs disciples = the rest of the cast (sesaparisÄ).

## Full Story
âA thousand crowns.â
 
[5.127] {5.247}
 This is a story told by the Teacher, while dwelling at Jetavana, concerning the Perfection of Renunciation. On this occasion the Bodhisatta sitting in the Dhamma Hall in the midst of the monks, as they were singing the praises of the Perfection of Renunciation, said: âMonks, not only now, but of old also the TathÄgata verily left the world and made the Great Renunciation,â and so saying he related a story of the past.

1. âA thousand crowns for one that sees my friend and playmate dear.

A hundred lo! I give if one of Sonaka should hear.â 
[5.129]

2. âA thousand crowns for one that sees my friend and playmate dear,

A hundred lo! I give if one of Sonaka should hear.â 
[5.130]

3. âThen up and spake that little boy â five tangled locks he wore â

The thousand give to me who saw, who heard a hundred more:

Iâll tell you news of Sonaka, your playfellow of yore.â

4. âPray in what country, realm, or town have you wandering been,

And where was Sonaka, my friend, I pray you tell me, seen?â


5. âWithin this realm, in thine own park is many a big SÄl tree

With leaves dark green and stems so straight, a pleasant sight to see;


6. Their branches densely interlaced, cloud-like, to heaven they rise,

And at their foot lo! Sonaka in meditation lies,

Filled with the Arahatâs holy calm, when human passion dies.â


7. The king then started in full force and levelling the road

He made his way straight to the place of Sonakaâs abode.


8. There wandering midst an ample grove within his pleasure ground,

All passionless, in saintly bliss, his friend at rest he found.

9. âHis parents dead, with shaven head, clad in monkâs robe I see

A wretched monk in a trance, stretched here beneath this tree.â


10. On hearing this Sonaka said: âHe is no wretched wight

Who in his every action, sire, has aye attained to right.
 {5.252}


11. Nay rather wretched those who right neglect and practise ill,

For evil doer evil doom is destined to fulfil.â

12. âAs king of KÄsi I am known, Arindama my name,

Since coming here, sir, have you met with aught deserving blame?â

13. â âMongst blessings of poor homeless monk I ever count it one,

In jar or box or granary he stores has hoarded none,

But only craves what others leave and lives content thereon.


14. The next of all his blessings this is one deserving praise,

He free from blame enjoys his food and no one him gainsays.


15. Third blessing of the monk I hold is this, that all his days

He eats his food in happiness and no one him gainsays.


16. The fourth of all his blessings is that wheresoeâer he goes,

He wanders free throughout the realm and no attachment knows.


17. Fifth blessing this that should the town, wherever he may be,

Perish in flames, he suffers not, for nought to burn has he.
 [5.131] {5.253}


18. The sixth of all the blessings he may reckon to his lot

That if the realm should be despoiled, he suffers not a jot.


19. The seventh of the blessings that to poverty he owes,

Though robbers should his path beset, and many dangerous foes,

With bowl and robe the holy man ever in safety goes.


20. Last blessing this that wheresoeâer our wanderer may fare,

Homeless and poor, he journeys on without regret or care.â
 {5.254}

21. âYour many blessings you may praise but what am I to do

Who worldly pleasures, Sonaka, so greedily pursue?


22. Dear are all human joys to me and heavenly joys as well,

But how to gain both worlds at once, to me, I pray you, tell.â

23. âWho greedily on pleasure bent their worldly sensual desires would sate,

Work wickedness awhile, to be reborn in woeful state.


24. But they who leave desire behind through life all fearless go,

And reaching concentration 
ekodibhÄva,
 concentration of mind, see R. Morris, 
JPTS
 1885, p. 32 and 
Academy,
 March 27, 1886.
 pure are neâer reborn to woe.


25. Here tell I you a parable; Arindama, give heed,

Some that are wise through parable my meaning best may read.


26. See! Borne along on Gangesâ flooded tide a carcase vast,

A foolish crow thought to himself as it was floating past,


27. Oh what a carriage I have found and goodly store of food,

Here will I stay both night and day, enjoying blissful mood.


28. So eats he flesh of elephant and drinks from Gangesâ stream,

And budging not sees grove and shrine pass by him in a dream.


29. Thus heedless and on carrion vile so all intent was he,

The Ganges swept him headlong to the perils of the sea.


30. But when with food exhausted he, poor bird, attempted a flight,

Nor east nor west nor south nor north was any land in sight.


31. Far out at sea, so weak was he, long ere he reached the shore,

âMidst countless perils of the deep he fell to rise no more.


32. For crocodiles and monster fish, where our poor flutterer lay,

Came ravening all around and quick devoured their quivering prey.


33. So you and all that greedily pleasures of sense pursue

Are deemed as wise as was this crow, till you all sensual desires eschew.


34. My parable proclaims the Dhamma. To it, O king, give heed,

Your fame for good or ill will grow according to your deed.â
 {5.257}

35. âIn pity once, nay even twice, utter the warning word,

But keep not on repeating it, like slave before his lord.â 
[5.132]


36. âThus in his wisdom infinite did Sonaka the seer

Instruct the king, and then in space straightway did disappear.â

37. âWhere are my charioteers, dispatched a worthy king to find?

I would no longer reign; henceforth my crown I have resigned.


38. Tomorrow one may die, who knows? Iâll be ordained today;

Lest, like the foolish crow, I fall âneath passionâs baneful sway.â

39. âYou have a son, DÄ«ghÄvu named, a goodly prince is he,

By sprinkling raise him to the throne, for he our king shall be.â

40. âThen quickly bring DÄ«ghÄvu here, a goodly prince is he,

By sprinkling raise him to the throne, for he your king shall be.â


41. When they had brought DÄ«ghÄvu there, their nursing king to be,

His sire addressed his darling boy â an only son was he.


42. âFull sixty thousand villages I once did claim as mine,

Take them, my son, to you henceforth my kingdom I resign.


43. Tomorrow one may die, who knows? Iâll be ordained today;

Lest, like the foolish crow, I fall âneath passionâs baneful sway.


44. Lo! Sixty thousand elephants with splendour all bedight,

With girths of gold, caparisoned with trappings golden-bright,


45. Each ridden by his own mahout, with spikÃ¨d hook in hand,

Take them, my son, I give them you as ruler of the land.
 {5.259}


46. Tomorrow one may die, who knows? Iâll be ordained today;

Lest, like the foolish crow, I fall âneath passionâs baneful sway.


47. Lo! Sixty thousand horses here, bedecked in bright array

â Sindh horses, all of noble breed and fleet of foot are they â


48. Each ridden by a henchman bold, with sword and bow in hand,

Take them, my son, I give them you as ruler of the land.


49. Tomorrow one may die, who knows? Iâll be ordained today;

Lest, like the foolish crow, I fall âneath passionâs baneful sway.


50. Lo! Sixty thousand cars all yoked, with banners flying free,

With tiger skin and panther hide, a gorgeous sight to see,
 [5.133]


51. Each driven by mailÃ©d charioteers, all armed with bow in hand,

Take them, my son, I give them you, as ruler of the land.


52. Tomorrow one may die, who knows? Iâll be ordained today;

Lest, like the foolish crow, I fall âneath passionâs baneful sway.


53. Lo! Sixty thousand kine so red, with bulls on every hand,

Take them, my son, I give them you as ruler of the land.


54. Tomorrow one may die, who knows? Iâll be ordained today;

Lest, like the foolish crow, I fall âneath passionâs baneful sway.


55. Here twice eight thousand maidens fair in goodly vesture stand,

With many a jewelled bracelet decked and rings upon each hand,

Take them, my son, I give them you, as ruler of the land.


56. Tomorrow one may die, who knows? Iâll be ordained today;

Lest, like the foolish crow, I fall âneath passionâs baneful sway.â


57. âThey say 
This and the two following verses are spoken by the young prince.
 to me, âYour mother dear, alas, poor boy, is dead,â

I cannot live without you too. All joy from life is fled.


58. As close behind old elephant a young one oft is found

Moving through mountain-pass or wood, oâer rough or level ground,


59. So bowl in hand Iâll follow you, wherever you may lead,

Nor shall you find me burdensome or difficult to feed.â


60. âAs oft 
This and the two following verses are spoken by king Arindama.
 some ship of merchants seeking gain at any cost

Is swallowed by a whirlpool 
The commentary explains 
vohÄra
 as a âmonster fishâ or âwhirlpool.â
 and both ship and crew are lost,


61. So lest I find a stumbling-block in this accursÃ¨d boy,

Instal him in my palace there all pleasures to enjoy â 
{5.260}


62. With maids whose hands caressing him with gleaming gold are bright,

Like Sakka midst his AccharÄ, heâll ever take delight.â


63. Then brought they prince DÄ«ghÄvu to the palace, home of joy,

And seeing him these maidens fair addressed the royal boy.


64. âWho are you? Deva, Gandhabba, or Sakka known to fame,

Dispensing alms in every town? We fain would learn your name.â


65. âNo Deva I nor Gandhabba nor Sakka known to fame,

But heir to king of KÄsi, prince DÄ«ghÄvu is my name.

So cherish me and happy be: each one as wife I claim.â


66. Then thus unto DÄ«ghÄvu, their liege lord, these maidens said;

âWhere has the king a refuge gained, and whither is he fled?â


67. âThe king escaped from miry ways is safe upon dry ground,

From thorns and jungle free at last the high road he has found.


68. But I am set upon a path that leads to woeful state,

Through thorns and jungle on I press to reach an awful fate.â


69. âWelcome to us, as lion is to cubs in mountain lair,

Bear sway henceforth, our sovereign lord, the true and rightful heir.â
 {5.261}

The Teacher here ended his lesson and said: âNot only now, monks, but also of old the TathÄgata verily made the Great Renunciation,â and he identified the JÄtaka, saying: âAt that time the Paccekabuddha obtained NibbÄna, the son was the young RÄhula, and king Arindama was I myself.â

In the present AjÄtasattu murders his father, the good king BimbisÄra. Later, regretting it, he seeks out the Buddha and is consoled. The Buddha tells a story of a prince, who, impatient for the throne slew his father. His friend, who had become an ascetic returns and teaches him about the results of deeds, and the king mended his ways.


The Bodhisatta = the wise Saá¹kicca (Saá¹kiccapaá¹á¸ita),

the Buddhaâs disciples = the group of seers (isigaá¹a).

## Full Story
âAt sight of Brahmadatta.â
 This story the Teacher, while dwelling in the mango grove of JÄ«vaka, told concerning the murder of his own father by AjÄtasattu. For owing to Devadatta 
{5.262}
 and at his instigation he had his father put to death. But when sickness arose in the schismatic Saá¹gha following upon the division in the Saá¹gha, Devadatta resolved to go and ask pardon of the TathÄgata, and, as he was journeying in a litter to SÄvatthi he was swallowed up by the earth at the gate of Jetavana. On hearing this AjÄtasattu thought: âBecause Devadatta was an enemy of the supreme Buddha, he has disappeared into the earth and is destined to the AvÄ«ci hell. It was owing to him that I murdered my holy father, that king of Dhamma. I too shall surely be swallowed up by the earth.â And he was so terrified that he found no enjoyment in his royal splendour, and thinking he would rest awhile, he had no sooner fallen asleep than he seemed to be dropped into a world of iron nine leagues thick, and beaten as it were with iron spikes and devoured by dogs continually snapping at him, and with a terrible cry he rose up.


So one day at full moon 
KomudÄ«,
 the full moon day in the month 
KattikÄ
 [October-November].
 during the seasonal festival, when surrounded by a great retinue of courtiers he reflected on his own glory, he bethought him that his fatherâs glory was far greater than this, and that owing to Devadatta he had slain so excellent a king of Dhamma, and while he thought on this a fever sprang up in his limbs and his whole body was bathed in sweat. And considering who could drive away this fear from him he concluded that except the One with Ten Powers there was no one, and thinking: âI have done wrong greatly against the TathÄgata: who verily will take me into his presence?â and concluding there was no one but JÄ«vaka, he considered some way of getting him to go with him, and uttering an exalted utterance, âO sir, what a lovely clear night it is,â he said, âwhat if today we were to pay our respects to some monks or brahmins?â And when the virtues of PurÄna 
Instead of

PurÄá¹a,
 i.e. PurÄna Kassapa. cf. 
DÄ«ghanikÄya,
 ii. 2, where the name appears as PÅ«rÄá¹a.
 and other teachers had been sung by their respective disciples, without attending to what they said he cross-questioned JÄ«vaka, and on his telling of the virtues of the TathÄgata and crying, âLet his Majesty pay his respects to the Fortunate One,â he ordered elephant cars to be got ready and went to the mango grove of JÄ«vaka.


Approaching the TathÄgata with an obeisance and being kindly greeted by him, he inquired of the reward of asceticism in this present life, and after listening to a sweet discourse on this topic from the TathÄgata, at the end of the sermon he announced his discipleship, and having been reconciled to the TathÄgata he went his ways. Thenceforth distributing alms and keeping the moral law he associated with the TathÄgata, and listening 
[5.135]
 to his sweet discourse on the Dhamma and consorting with a virtuous friend, his fears abated and his feeling of horror disappeared, and he recovered his peace of mind and lived happily in the four postures.


Then one day they started a discussion in the Dhamma Hall, saying: âSirs, AjÄtasattu after slaying his father was terror-stricken and finding no enjoyment in his regal splendour he experienced pain in every posture. Then he went to the TathÄgata and by associating with a virtuous friend he lost his fears and enjoyed the happiness of lordship.â The Teacher came and asked, saying: âWhat topic, monks, are you now engaged in discussing in a meeting?â 
{5.263}
 and on their telling him what it was, he said: âNot only now, but of old too, this man, after murdering his father, through me recovered his peace of mind,â and he told a story of the past.

1. âAt sight of Brahmadatta thus enthroned in royal state,

He said, âO king, the friend for whom you are compassionate,


2. Saá¹kicca, lo! is here â of saints the chief in fame is he

Set out in haste and tarry not this holy sage to seeâ.


3. So quickly mounting on the car prepared at his behest,

The king begirt with courtier friends set forth upon his quest.


4. The emblems five of royal pomp straight doffed the KÄsi lord,

Umbrella, turban, yak-tail fan, with shoes, also his sword.


5. Then stepping from his car the king, stripped of his bright array,

To DÄyapassa park, where sat Saá¹kicca, took his way.


6. The king drew nigh and greeting him with words of courtly phrase,

Recalled the converse they had held together in old days.


7. And as he sat beside him, when occasion fit arose,

A question as to sinful deeds he hastened to propose.


8. âSaá¹kicca, lord of saintly band, great sage, whom here I see

Sitting in DÄyapassa park, I fain would question thee.
 {5.265}


9. How fare transgressors after death? Born to what state are they?

I too have erred from righteousness. Your answer quick, I pray.â â

10. âSaá¹kicca thus addressed the king who ruled oâer KÄsi land,

Sitting in DÄyapassa glades: âMark, sire, and understand:


11. Should you point out the road to one gone hopelessly astray,

And he should follow your advice, no thorns beset his way.


12. But he that walks in evil ways, should you direct aright,

And he should follow your advice, escapes from woeful plight.â â
 {5.266}

13. âRight is like the high road,

Wrong is but a bye-road.

Right to heaven aye wins its way,

Wrong to hell leads men astray.


14. Men that transgress Dhamma, O sire, and live unrighteously,

What fate they suffer after death in hell, now hear from me.


15. SaÃ±jÄ«va, KÄá¸·asutta and Roruva, great and small,

Saá¹ghÄta, Great AvÄ«ci, are names that may well appal,

With Tapana and PatÄpana, eight major hells in all.

Twice eight times more in number, a kind of minor hell â


17. Dread flames here torture sinful men, all cruel deeds abound,

Horror, amazement, anguish, woe and terror reign around.


18. Four square with fourfold doors is each, in due proportion spaced,

With dome of iron âtwas oâerarched, by iron wall embraced,


19. Its base of iron wrought is such no raging flame may melt,

Though eâen a hundred leagues around its mighty power is felt.


20. All that have outrage done to saints or injured holy men

Fall headlong into hellâs abyss, no more to rise again.


21. In evil plight their mangled frames, piece-meal like fish on toast,

For their misdeeds through countless years in hell are doomed to roast.


22. Their limbs consumed with burning heat, to torture dread a prey,

Though eager to escape from hell they never find a way.


23. Seeking an outlet to and fro to east or west they fly,

Or baffled hurry north or south, a hopeless quest to ply,

For gods are there to bar the way, whichever door they try.
 {5.267}


24. Poor souls, for many thousand years they dwell in hellâs domain,

With arms outstretched they sore lament their overwhelming pain.


25. Like deadly poison-snake whose wrath âtwere fatal to arouse,

Shun to attack the saints that live bound by ascetic vows.


26. Ajjuna, 
[See Ja 522 
Sarabhaá¹gajÄtaka

 lord of KekakÄs, great archer, who annoyed

Gotama, was despite his bulk and thousand arms destroyed.


27. So Daá¹á¸aki

 defiling Kisavaccha, sinless one,

Like palm tree from the roots cut down, was utterly undone.

 the men of Viá¹£á¹u race

With Andhakas

 sought Yamaâs realm, each slain by otherâs mace.


30. Cursed by a sage, Cecca 
[See Ja 422 
CetiyajÄtaka
.]
 who once could tread the air, they say,

Was lost and swallowed by the earth on his appointed day.


31. The wilful fool can never gain the approval of the wise,

But guileless souls, equipped with truth, are slow to utter lies.


32. Whoso would lie in wait to catch some wise and holy man,

Hurled down to hell will quickly learn to rue his wicked plan.


33. But who with treacherous cruelty shall aged saints assail,

Shall like a dying palm tree stump, childless and heirless, fail.


34. Whoso some mighty sage, a monk of life austere, shall slay,

In KÄá¸·asutta hell shall suffer torture many a day.


35. And if a wicked Maga king his realm should overthrow,

He shall when dead in Tapana like sufferings undergo.


36. A hundred thousand years, as gods count years, heâs doomed to dwell,

Clad in a robe of living flame, âmidst agonies of hell.
 {5.268}


37. Bright jets of fire on every side shoot from his tortured frame,

His very limbs, hair, nails and all, serve but to feed the flame.


38. And as his body burns apace, racked through and through with pain,

Like a goad-stricken elephant, poor wretch, he roars amain.


39. Whoso from greed or hatred shall, vile creature, slay his sire,

In KÄá¸·asutta hell long time shall agonize in fire.


40. In iron cauldron boiled till he shall peel,

The parricide is pierced with shafts of steel,

Then blinded and on filth condemned to feed

Heâs plunged in brine, to expiate his deed.


41. Then Yakkhas âtwixt his jaws, lest they should close,

Hot iron ball or ploughshare interpose,

These fixed with cords his mouth so firmly prop,

They into it a stream of filth can drop.


42. Vultures, both black and brown, and ravens too,

And birds with iron beaks, a motley crew,

Rending his tongue to many a fragment small,

Devour the quivering morsel, blood and all.


43. The Rakkhasas flitting to and fro

Assail the wretch with many a blow,

On his charred breast or broken limb

With cruel glee they buffet him.

The joy is theirs, but woes abide

With all that in such hell reside

For earthly crime of parricide.


44. The son that slays his mother straight to Yamaâs realm is sent,

In retribution for his deed to reap due punishment.
 [5.139]


45. There powerful Beings seize on one guilty of matricide,

And plough with iron shares his back in furrows deep and wide. 
{5.269}


46. The blood like molten copper from his wounds that flows they take,

And give it to the guilty wretch, his burning thirst to slake.


47. He stands plunged in a crimson lake as âtwere of clotted blood,

Breathing foul stench of carrion vile or evil smelling mud.


48. Enormous worms with iron mouths, piercing their victimâs skin,

Devour his flesh right greedily and suck the blood within.


49. In hell one hundred fathoms deep behold the victim sinks,

While for a hundred leagues around dead carcase like he stinks.


50. By reason of the stench, O king, such is his sorry plight,

Though once possessed of vision keen he suffers loss of sight.


51. Past out from KhuradhÄra hell, grim prison house hard to flee,

Abortion-mongers âscape not your dread stream, Vetaraá¹Ä«. 
A river in Hell.


52. Silk-cotton trees with thorns foot long of iron wrought, âtis said,

On either bank, VetaranÄ«, oâerhang your gloomy bed.


53. All clothed in flame, one mass of fire, they stand against the sky,

And all ablaze with brilliant light tower a full league on high.


54. Here fixed upon sharp thorns red-hot in hell appear to view

Unfaithful husbands, guilty wives, the whole adulterous crew.


55. Beaten with stripes headlong they fall, revolving in their flight,

And there with mangled limbs they lie awake the livelong night.


56. At dawn they hide themselves in Iron Cauldron, 
JÄtaka,
 iii p. 29 (English version).
 known to fame,

Big as a mountain âtis and full of water like to flame.


57. So clad in folly like a robe these sinners night and day,

For their ill deeds wrought long ago, fit retribution pay.


58. Whoso as wife bought with his gold her husband shall despise,

Or shall regard his kith and kin with ever scornful eyes,

Her tongue, wrenched out with hook and line, shall suffer agonies.
 {5.270}


59. She sees her tongue drawn out all full of worms, nor may complain,

Silent perforce, in Tapana enduring awful pain.


60. Slayers of sheep and swine and cows, and followers of the chase,

Fishermen, robbers, cruel all, explain as fair things base,


61. Assailed with swords and iron clubs, headlong, these men of blood,

Pursued with spears and arrows fall into a briny flood.


62. The forger, harried night and day with club of iron forged,

Feeds only on the filthy mess by some poor rogue disgorged.


63. Crows, ravens, vultures, jackals too, all armed with iron jaw,

Entomb the struggling wretch alive in their insatiate maw.


64. Who shall with beast 
This would refer to hunting the deer with dogs or the cheetah, or to the sport of hawking.
 hunt beast to death, or bird with bird shall slay,

Oâerwhelmed with wrong shall sink to hell, to rue the accursÃ©d day.â
 {5.276}

65. âThrough virtue stored on earth of old the good to heaven attain,

Here Brahmas, Devas, Sakka, lo! ripe fruit of virtue gain.


66. This then I say, bear righteous sway throughout your realm, my king,

For justice done is merit won, nor eâer regret will bring.â
 {5.277}

The Teacher here ended his story and said: âNot only now, but of old also was he consoled by me,â and he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time AjÄtasattu was the king, the followers of Buddha formed the company of the ascetic, and I myself was the sage Saá¹kicca.â

## Analysis
In the present one monk on seeing a woman is overcome with lust and wishes to leave the monastic life. The Buddha tells a story of an ugly king who fashioned a golden image of the woman he wished to marry. When she was found, she could not bear to be with him and returned to her home. The king followed her and did many menial jobs to attract her attention, and eventually won her over by defeating seven kings in battle.

âThis realm.â
 
[5.141] {5.278}
 This was a tale the Teacher, while dwelling at Jetavana, told about a discontented monk. The story tells that he was of noble birth and lived at SÄvatthi, and on his heartily embracing the dispensation he adopted the ascetic life. Now one day as he was going his rounds for alms in SÄvatthi, he met a fair lady and fell in love with her at first sight. Overcome by his passion he lived an unhappy life, and letting his nails and hair grow long and wearing soiled robes, he pined away and became quite sallow, with all his veins standing out on his body. And just as in the Deva world, the Devaputtas who are destined to fall from their heavenly existence manifest five well-known signs, that is to say, their garlands wither, their robes soil, their bodies grow ill-favoured, perspiration pours from their armpits, and they no longer find pleasure in their Deva home, so too in the case of worldly monks, who fall from the Dhamma, the same five signs are to be seen: the flowers of faith wither, the robes of righteousness soil, through discontent and the effects of an evil name their persons grow ill-favoured, the sweat of corruption streams from them and they no longer delight in a life of solitude at the foot of forest trees â all these signs were to be found in him. So they brought him into the presence of the Teacher, saying: âVenerable sir, this fellow is discontented.â The Teacher asked if it were true, and on his confessing that it was, he said: âMonk, be not the slave of wrongdoing. This is a wicked woman; overcome your passion for her, take pleasure in the dispensation. Verily through falling in love with a woman, sages of old, mighty though they were, lost their power and came to misery and destruction.â And so saying he told a story of the past.

1. âThis realm with joy and bliss untold,

Trappings of state and wealth of gold,

This realm, I say, rule you for me:

I go to seek PabhÄvatÄ«.â

2. âKusa, for you by day and night

To bear this burden is not right.

Haste back, pray, to KusÄvatÄ«;

Your ugly form Iâm loth to see.â 
{5.294}

3. âBound by your beautyâs spell, PabhÄvatÄ«,

My native land has little charm for me;

Maddaâs fair realm is ever my delight,

My crown resigned, to live in your dear sight.


4. O soft-eyed maiden, fair PabhÄvatÄ«,

What is this madness that oâermasters me?

Knowing full well the land that gave me birth,

I wander half distraught oâer all the earth.


5. Clad in bright-coloured bark and girt with golden zone,

Your love, fair maid, I crave, and not an earthly throne.â

Success alone is what we praise, to lose is misery.â

9. âHard hearted as a stone are you, so soft to outward view,

No word of welcome though Iâve come from far your love to sue. 
{5.296}


10. When you do frown regarding me, proud dame, with sullen look,

Then I in royal Maddaâs halls am nothing but a cook.


11. But if, O queen, in pity you should deign to smile on me,

No longer cook, once more am I lord of KusÄvatÄ«.â

12. âIf fortune tellers spoke true words, âtwas this in truth they said,

May you in pieces seven be hewn, ere you king Kusa wed.â

Save me king Kusa, you shall have none other as your lord.â

On coming to KusÄvatÄ«,

Should only deign to speak to me.

On coming to KusÄvatÄ«,

If slender-limbed PabhÄvatÄ«

Should laugh with joy at sight of me.


18. Necklace of gold Iâll give to you,

On coming to KusÄvatÄ«,

If slender-limbed PabhÄvatÄ«

Should lay a loving hand on me.â
 {5.298}

19. âThis royal dame no pleasure feels Kusa once more to see,

Though, wanting nought, he serves as cook for simple hirelingâs fee.â

20. âThis humpbacked slave without a doubt,

For speaking such a word,

Deserves to have her tongue cut out

With keenest sharpened sword.â

21. âEsteem him not, PabhÄvatÄ«, by outward form or height,

Great glory his, so do whateâer is pleasing in his sight.


22. Esteem him not, PabhÄvatÄ«, by outward form or height,

Great wealth is his, so do whateâer is pleasing in his sight.


23. Esteem him not, PabhÄvatÄ«, by outward form or height,

Great power is his, so do whateâer is pleasing in his sight.

Wide rule is his, so do whateâer is pleasing in his sight.


25. Esteem him not, PabhÄvatÄ«, by outward form or height,

Great king is he, so do whateâer is pleasing in his sight.


26. Esteem him not, PabhÄvatÄ«, by outward form or height,

Lion-voiced is he, so do whateâer is pleasing in his sight.


27. Esteem him not, PabhÄvatÄ«, by outward form or height,

Clear-voiced is he, so do whateâer is pleasing in his sight.


28. Esteem him not, PabhÄvatÄ«, by outward form or height,

Deep-voiced is he, so do whateâer is pleasing in his sight.

Sweet-voiced is he, so do whateâer is pleasing in his sight.
 [5.157]

Honey-voiced is he, so do whateâer is pleasing in his sight.

A hundred arts are his, so do whatâs pleasing in his sight.

Ere yet they trample down our walls, send off in haste the maid.â

35. âIn pieces seven PabhÄvatÄ« to hack, it is my will,

One piece for each of these seven kings, who came her sire to kill.â

36. âComely though swart of hue uprose the queen and moved before

Her train of handmaids, clad in silk attire and weeping sore.â

37. âThis face with powder beautified, here mirrored in a glass

To ivory handle deftly fixed, so winsome now, alas,

With innocence and purity in every line expressed,

By warrior princes spurned in some lone forest soon will rest.


38. These locks of hair so black of hue, bound up in stately coil,

Soft to the touch and fragrant with the finest sandal oil,

In charnel ground though covered up the vultures soon will find

And with their talons rend and tear and scatter to the wind.


39. These arms whose finger tips are dyed, like copper, crimson red,

In richest sandal oil oft bathed and with soft down oâerspread,

Cut off and by proud kings in some lone forest flung aside,

A wolf will seize and carry off whereâer heâs fain to hide.


40. My teats are like the dates that on the palms with ripeness swell,

Fragrant with scent of sandalwood that men of KÄsi fell:

Hanging thereon a jackal soon at them, I think, will tug,

Just as a little baby boy his motherâs breast may hug.


41. These hips of mine, well-knit and broad, cast in an ample mould,

Encircled with golden girdle, wrought of the purest gold,

Cut off and by proud kings in some lone forest flung aside,

A wolf will seize and carry off whereâer heâs fain to hide.


42. Dogs, wolves, jackals and whatsoeâer are known as beasts of prey,

If once they eat PabhÄvatÄ«, can suffer no decay.


43. Should warrior kings that come from far your daughterâs body flay,

Begging my bones, burn them with fire in some sequestered way.


44. Then make a garden near and plant a kaá¹ikÄra tree,

And when at winterâs close it blooms, mother, recalling me,

Point to the flower and say, âJust such was dear PabhÄvatÄ«.â â
 [5.159] {5.303}

45. âSeeing the sword and block set out within the fatal ring,

All Deva-like the royal dame rose up and sought the king.â 
{5.304}

46. âWith this sword will the Madda king his graceful daughter slay,

And piecemeal send her mangled limbs to rival chiefs a prey.â

47. âYou did not hearken to my voice, when counselling your good,

Today you sink to Yamaâs realm, your body stained with blood.


48. Such fate does every man incur, or even a worse end,

Who deaf to good advice neglects the warnings of a friend.


49. If you today a gallant prince for your good lord should wed,

Bedight with zone of gold and gems, in land of Kusa bred,

You would not, served with hosts of friends, to Yamaâs realms have sped.


50. When drums are beat and elephantsâ loud trumpetings resound,

In royal halls, where in this world can greater bliss be found?


51. When horses neigh 
Reading

 and minstrels play to kings some plaintive air,

With bliss like this in royal halls, what is there to compare?


52. When too courts with the peacockâs and the heronâs cries resound,

And cuckooâs call, where else, I pray, can bliss like this be found?â
 {5.305}

53. âWhereâs he that crushes hostile realms and vanquishes his foes?

Kusa, the noble and the wise, would free us from our woes.â 
[5.160]

54. âThe conqueror who crushes all his foes, lo! here is he;

Kusa, so noble and so wise, all foes will slay for me.â

55. âAre you gone mad, or like a fool do speak at random thus?

If Kusa has returned, why, pray, did you not tell it us?â 
{5.306}

56. âGood mother, look at yonder cook, with loins girt up right well,

He stoops to wash his pots and pans, where royal maidens dwell.â

57. âAre you base-born or would you deign, a maid of royal race,

To take a slave for your true love, to Maddaâs deep disgrace?â

58. âNo low caste I, nor would I shame my royal name, I swear,

Good luck to you, no slave is he but king OkkÄkaâs heir.â

59. âHe twenty thousand brahmins ever feeds, no slave, I swear,

It is OkkÄkaâs royal son whom you see is standing there. 
{5.307}


60. He twenty thousand elephants aye yokes, no slave, I swear,

It is OkkÄkaâs royal son whom you see is standing there.


61. He twenty thousand horses ever yokes, no slave, I swear,

It is OkkÄkaâs royal son whom you see is standing there.


62. He twenty thousand chariots ever yokes, no slave, I swear,

It is OkkÄkaâs royal son whom you see is standing there.

64. He twenty thousand royal kine aye milks, no slave, I swear,

 [5.161]

65. âLike elephant as frog disguised,

When this almighty prince came here,

âTwas wrong of you and ill-advised

To hide it from your parents dear.â

66. âIn that we failed to recognise

Your majesty in this disguise,

If, sire, to you offence we gave,

We would forgiveness humbly crave.â

67. âFor me to play the scullionâs part was very wrong I own,

Be comforted, it was no fault of yours I was unknown.â

68. âGo, silly girl, your pardon from the great king Kusa crave,

His wrath appeased he may be pleased perhaps your life to save.â

With lowly head she clasped the feet of Kusa, mighty lord.â

73. âIâll do your bidding, lady fair, as far as lies in me;

No anger feel I in my heart. Fear not, PabhÄvatÄ«.

74. Hearken, O royal maid, to me, I too make promise true;

Never again will I offend in aught that I may do.

76. âGo, quickly yoke my well-trained steeds to many a painted car,

And watch me boldly sally forth, to scatter foes afar.â

78. âMounted on back of elephant, the queen behind her lord,

81. Sakka right glad at heart looked on in forefront of the fight,

And to king Kusa gave a gem, Verocana âtwas hight.


82. The battle won, king Kusa took the magic gem and then

Mounted on back of elephant sought Maddaâs town again.


83. The kings he takes alive and bound in chains with them he goes,

And to his royal father cries, âBehold, my lord, your foes.

At your good pleasure slay them all or set them free once more.â â

One maid to each of princes seven, fair maids to warriors brave.

90. Taking his magic jewel bright, back to KusÄvatÄ«,

Neither outshone the other, for they both alike were fair.


92. Mother came forth to meet her son. Husband henceforth and wife

The Teacher, ending his lesson, revealed the Truths and identified the JÄtaka. At the end of the Truths the discontented monk was established in the fruition of the First Path. âAt that time the father and mother were members of the royal household, the younger brother was Änanda, the humpback was KhujjuttarÄ, PabhÄvatÄ« was the mother of RÄhula, the retinue were Buddhaâs followers, king Kusa was I myself.â

âAngel or minstrel-god.â
 This was a story told by the Teacher, while living at Jetavana, about a monk who supported his mother. The circumstance which led up to it was the same as that related in the SÄmajÄtaka [Ja 540].

They say that there was a wealthy merchant at SÄvatthi, who was worth eighteen crores; and he had a son who was very dear and winning to his father and mother. One day the youth went upon the terrace of the house, and opened a window and looked down on the street; and when he saw the great crowd going to Jetavana with perfumes and garlands in their hands to hear the Dhamma preached, he exclaimed that he would go too.


So having ordered perfumes and garlands to be brought, he went to the monastery, and having distributed robes, medicines, drinks, etc. to the assembly and honoured the Fortunate One with perfumes and garlands, he sat down on one side. After hearing the Dhamma, and perceiving the evil consequences of desire and the blessings arising from adopting the ascetic life, when the assembly broke up he asked the Fortunate One for ordination, but he was told that the TathÄgatas do not ordain anyone who has not obtained the permission of his parents; so he went away, and lived a week without food, and having at last obtained his parentsâ consent, he returned and begged for ordination. The Teacher sent a monk who ordained him; and after he was ordained he obtained great honour and gain; he won the favour of his teachers and preceptors, and having received full orders he mastered the Dhamma in five years.


Then he thought to himself, âI live here distracted â it is not suitable for me,â and he became anxious to reach the goal of spiritual insight; so having obtained instruction in meditation from his teacher, he departed to a frontier village and dwelt in the forest, and there having entered a course of insight, however much he laboured and strove for twelve years, he failed to attain any special insight.


His parents also, as time went on, became poor, for those who hired their land or carried on merchandise for them, finding out that there was no son or brother in the family to enforce the payment, seized what they could lay their hands upon and ran away as they pleased, and the servants and labourers in the house seized the gold and coin and made off therewith, so that at the end the two were reduced to an evil plight and had not even a jug for pouring water; and at last they sold their dwelling, and finding themselves homeless, and in extreme misery, they wandered begging for alms, clothed in rags and carrying potsherds in their hands.


Now at that time a monk came from Jetavana to the sonâs place of abode; he performed the duties of hospitality and, as he sat quietly, he first asked whence he was come; and learning that he was come from Jetavana he asked after the health of the Teacher and the principal disciples and then asked for news of his parents, âTell me, sir, about the welfare of such and such a merchantâs family in SÄvatthi.â âO friend, donât ask for news of that family.â âWhy not, sir?â âThey say that there was one son in that family, but he has become an ascetic in this dispensation, and since he left the world that family has gone to ruin; and at the present time the two old people are reduced to a most lamentable state and beg for alms.â


When he heard the otherâs words he could not remain unmoved, but began to weep with his eyes full of tears, and when the other asked him why he wept, âO sir,â he replied, âthey are my own father and mother, I am their son.â âO friend, your father and mother have come to ruin through you â do you go and take care of them.â âFor twelve years,â he thought to himself, âI have laboured and striven but never been able to attain the Path or the Fruit: I must be incompetent; what have I to do with the ascetic life? I will become a householder and will support my parents and give away my wealth, and will thus eventually become destined for heaven.â


So having determined he gave up his abode in the forest to the elder, and the next day departed and by successive stages reached the monastery at the back of Jetavana which is not far from SÄvatthi. There he found two roads, one leading to Jetavana, the other to SÄvatthi. As he stood there, he thought: âShall I see my parents first or the One with Ten Powers?â Then he said to himself, âIn old days I saw my parents for a long time, from henceforth I shall rarely have the chance of seeing the Buddha; I will see the Fully Awakened One today and hear the Dhamma, and then tomorrow morning I will see my parents.â So he left the road to SÄvatthi and in the evening arrived at Jetavana.


Now that very day at daybreak, the Teacher, as he looked upon the world, had seen the potentialities of this young man, and when he came to visit him he praised the virtues of parents in the MÄtiposakasutta [SN 7.19]. As he stood at the end of the assembly of elders and listened, he thought: âIf I become a householder I can support my parents; but the Teacher also says, âA son who has become an ascetic can be helpful,â I went away before without seeing the Teacher, and I failed in such an imperfect ordination; I will now support my parents while still remaining an ascetic without becoming a householder.â So he took his ticket and his ticket-food and gruel, and felt as if he had committed a wrong deserving expulsion after a solitary abode of twelve years in the forest. In the morning he went to SÄvatthi and he thought to himself, âShall I first get the gruel or see my parents?â He reflected that it would not be right to visit them in their poverty empty-handed; so he first got the gruel and then went to the door of their old house.


When he saw them sitting by the opposite wall after having gone their round for the alms given in broth, he stood not far from them in a sudden burst of sorrow with his eyes full of tears. They saw him but knew him not; then his mother, thinking that it was someone standing for alms, said to him, âWe have nothing fit to be given to you, be pleased to pass on.â When he heard her, he repressed the grief which filled his heart and remained still standing as before with his eyes full of tears, and when he was addressed a second and a third time he still continued standing.


At last the father said to the mother, âGo to him; can this be your son?â She rose and went to him and, recognising him, fell at his feet and lamented, and the father also joined his lamentations, and there was a loud outburst of sorrow. To see his parents he could not control himself, but burst into tears; then, after yielding to his feelings, he said: âDo not grieve, I will support you,â so having comforted them and made them drink some gruel, and sit down on one side, he went again and begged for some food and gave it to them, and then went and asked for alms for himself, and having finished his meal, took up his abode at a short distance off.


From that day forward he watched over his parents in this manner; he gave them all the alms he received for himself, even those at the fortnightly distributions, and he went on separate expeditions for his own alms, and ate them; and whatever food he received as provision for the rainy season he gave to them, while he took their worn-out garments and dyed them with the doors fast closed and used them himself; but the days were few when he gained alms and there were many when he failed to win anything, and his inner and outer clothing became very rough.


As he watched over his parents he gradually grew very pale and thin and his friends and intimates said to him, âYour complexion used to be bright, but now you have become very pale â has some illness come upon you?â He replied, âNo illness has come upon me, but a hindrance has befallen me,â and he told them the history. âSir,â they replied, âthe Teacher does not allow us to waste the offerings of the faithful, you do an unlawful act in giving to laymen the offerings of the faithful.â When he heard this he shrank away ashamed.


But not satisfied with this they went and told it to the Teacher, saying: âSo and so, sir, has wasted the offerings of the faithful and used them to feed laymen.â

But on this occasion the Teacher said: âMonks, do not take offence at this monk. Sages of old, though they were offered rule over all JambudÄ«pa, refused to accept it and supported their parents,â and so saying he told a story of the past.

1. âA DevatÄ or Gandhabba are you, or do we see

Sakka, to cities bountiful, or mortal-born may be,

With magic powers endued? Your name we fain would learn from you.â

2. âNo DevatÄ, no Gandhabba, nor Sakka do you see:

A mortal I with magic powers. The truth I tell to you.â 
[5.168]

3. âGreat service you have wrought for us, beyond all words to tell,

âMidst floods of rain no single drop upon us ever fell.


4. Cool shade you did create for us, when parching winds arose,

From deadly shaft 
Reading

.
 you did us shield, amidst our countless foes.


5. Next many a happy realm you made own me as sovereign lord,

Over a hundred kings became obedient to our word.


6. What from our treasures you shall choose, we cheerfully resign,

Cars yoked to steeds or elephants, or nymphs attired so fine,

Or if a lovely palace be your choice, it shall be thine.


7. In Aá¹ga realms or Magadha if you are fain to live,

Would rule Avanti, Assaka â this too we gladly give.


8. Yea eâen half of all our realm we cheerfully resign,

Say but the word, what you would have, at once it shall be thine.â
 {5.318}

9. âNo kingdom do I crave, nor any town or land,

Nor do I seek to win great riches at your hand.â

10. Beneath your sovereign sway my aged parents dwell,

Enjoying holy calm in some lone woodland cell.


11. With these old sages Iâm allowed no merit to acquire,

If you and thine would plead my cause, Sona would cease his ire.â

12. âGladly in this will I perform, O brahmin, your behest,

But who are they that I should take to further your request?â 
{5.319}

13. âMore than a hundred householders, rich brahmins too I name,

And all these mighty warrior chiefs of noble birth and fame,

With king Manoja, are enough to satisfy my claim.â

14. âGo, harness steeds and elephants and yoke them to the car,

Go, fling my banners to the wind, from carriage-pole and bar,

I go to seek where Kosiya, 
The family name of Sona and his father.
 the ascetic, dwells afar.â


15. âEquipped then with his fourfold host the king marched out to seek

Where he did dwell in charming cell, an ascetic mild and meek.â

16. âWho goes to fetch him water through the air at such a pace,

With wooden pole not touching him by quite four inches space?â

17. âIâm Sona; from ascetic rule I never go astray

My parents I unweariedly support by night and day.


18. Berries and roots as food for them I gather in the wood,

Ever recalling to my mind how they once wrought me good.â

19. âWe fain would reach the hermitage where Kosiya does dwell,

Show us the road, good Sona, which will lead us to his cell.â

20. âThis is the path: mark well, O king, that clump of sombre green;

There âmidst a grove of ebon trees the hermitage is seen.â


21. Thus did the mighty sage instruct these warrior kings, and then

Once more he travelled through the air and hurried home again.


22. Next, having swept the hermitage, he sought his sireâs retreat,

And waking up the aged saint he offered him a seat.


23. âCome forth, he cried, O holy sage, be seated here, I pray,

For high-born kings of mighty fame will pass along this way.â


24. The old man having heard his son his presence thus implore,

Came forth in haste from out his hut and sat him by the door.â

25. âOn seeing him all in a blaze of glory standing near,

Surrounded by a band of kings, thus spoke the aged seer:


26. âWho marches here with tabour, conch, and beat of sounding drums,

Music to cheer the heart of kings? Who here in triumph comes?


27. Who in this blaze of glory comes, with turban-cloth of gold,

As lightning bright, and quiver-armed, a hero young and bold?


28. Who comes all bright and glorious, with face of golden sheen,

Like embers of acacia wood, aglow in furnace seen?


29. Who comes with his umbrella held aloft in such a way,

That it with ribs so clearly marked wards off the sunâs fierce ray?


30. Who is it, with a yak-tail fan stretched forth to guard his side,

Is seen, like some wise sage, on back of elephant to ride?


31. Who comes in pomp and majesty of parachutes all white,

And mail-clad steeds of noble strain, encircling left and right?


32. Who hither comes, surrounded by a hundred kings or more,

An escort of right noble kings, behind him and before?


33. With elephants, with chariots and with horse and foot brigade,

Who comes with all the pomp of war, in fourfold 
Elephants, cavalry, chariots and infantry.
 host arrayed?


34. Who comes with all the legions vast that follow in his train,

Unbroken, limitless as are the billows of the main?â


35. âIt is Manoja, king of kings, with Nanda here has come,

As though âtwere Sakka, lord of heaven, to this our ascetic home.


36. His is the mighty host that comes, obedient in his train,

Unbroken, limitless as are the billows of the main.â â
 {5.323}

37. âIn robe of finest silk arrayed, with sandal oil bedewed,

These kings approach the saintly men in suppliant attitude.â

38. âO holy men, we trust that you are prosperous and well,

With grain to glean and roots and fruit abundant where you dwell.


39. Have you been much by flies and gnats and creeping things annoyed,

Or from wild beasts of prey have you immunity enjoyed?â
 [5.171]

40. âWe thank you, king, and answer thus: âWe prosper and are well,

With grain to glean and roots and fruit abundant where we dwell.


41. From flies and gnats and creeping things we suffer not annoy,

And from wild beasts of prey we here immunity enjoy.


42. Areca nuts for such as live as ascetics here abound,

No harmful sickness that I know has ever here been found.


43. Welcome, 
These lines occur in No. 503,

 O king, a happy chance directed you this way,

Mighty you are and glorious: what errand brings you, pray?
 {5.324}


44. The tindook and the piyal leaves, and kÄsumÄrÄ« sweet,

And fruits like honey, take the best we have, O king, and eat.


45. And this cool water from a cave high hidden on a hill,

O mighty monarch, take of it, drink if it be your will.â


46. âAccepted is your offering by me and all, but pray

Give ear to what wise Nanda here, our friend, has got to say.


47. For all of us in Nandaâs train as suppliants come to you,

To beg a gracious hearing for poor Nandaâs humble plea.â â

48. âLet country folk, a hundred odd, and brahmins of great fame,

And all these noble warrior chiefs, illustrious in name,

With king Manoja, our great lord, all sanction this my claim.

 to what I say give ear.


50. My homage paid to these, I next this holy sage address:

âIn me a brother you did erst as your right hand possess.


51. To serve my aged parents is the boon from you I ask:

Cease, mighty saint, to hinder me in this my holy task.
 {5.325}


52. Kind service to our parents has long time been paid by you;

The good approve such deeds â why not yield it in turn to me?

And to the merit I thus win the way to heaven is free.


53. Others there are that know in this the path of duty lies,

It is the way to heaven, as you, O sage, do recognise.


54. And yet a holy man bars me from merit such as this,

When I by service fain would bring my parents perfect bliss.â â
 {5.326}

55. âAll you that swell my brotherâs train, my words now hear in turn;

Whoso shall ancient precedent of his forefathers spurn,

Doing wrong âgainst his elders, he, reborn in hell, shall burn.


56. But they who are skilled in holy lore the Dhamma may know,

Keeping the moral law, shall neâer to world of suffering go.


57. Brother and sister, parents, all by kindred tie allied,

A charge upon the eldest son will evermore abide.
 [5.172]


58. As eldest son this heavy charge I gladly undertake,

And as a pilot guards his ship, whatâs right Iâll neâer forsake.â

59. âWe have found knowledge like a flame that shines at dead of night,

Eâen so has holy Kosiya revealed to us whatâs right.


60. Just as the sun-god by his rays illumines all the sea,

Showing the form of living things, as good or bad they be,

So holy Kosiya reveals whatâs right to me and thee.â
 {5.327}

61. âSince you my suppliant attitude heed not, nor outstretched hand,

Your humble bond-slave will I be, to wait at your command.â

62. âNanda, you know the true faith well, as saints have taught it thee,

âTis only noble to be good â you greatly pleasest me.


63. My worthy parents I salute: listen to what I say,

The charge of you as burden was neâer felt in any way.


64. My parents I have tended long, their happiness to earn,

Now Nanda comes and humbly begs to serve you in his turn.
 {5.328}


65. Whicheâer of you two saintly ones would Nandaâs service own,

Speak but the word and he shall come to wait on you alone.â

66. âSona, dear son, on whom we lean, if you allowest this,

Embracing him once more I will the holy Nanda kiss.â

67. âJust as the tender Bodhi tree shoot is shaken by the blast,

So throbs my heart with joy at sight of Nanda come at last.


68. Nanda, I think, as in a dream returned I seem to see,

Half mad and jubilant I cry, Nanda comes back to me.


69. But if on waking I should find my Nanda gone away,

To greater sorrow than before my soul would be a prey.
 {5.329}


70. Back to his parents dear today Nanda at last has come,

Dear to my lord and me alike, with us he makes his home.


71. Though Nanda to his sire is dear, let him stay where he will,

â You to your fatherâs wants attend â Nanda shall mine fulfil.â

72. âKind, pitiful, our refuge she that fed us at her breast,

A mother is the way to heaven, and you she loveth best.


73. She nursed and fostered us with care; graced with good gifts is she,

A mother is the way to heaven, and best she loveth thee.â

74. âCraving a child in prayer she kneels each holy shrine before,

The changing seasons closely scans and studies astral lore.


75. Pregnant in course of time she feels her tender longings grow,

And soon the unconscious babe begins a loving friend to know.


76. Her treasure for a year or less she guards with utmost care,

Then brings it forth and from that day a motherâs name will bear.


77. With milky breast and lullaby she soothes the fretting child,

Wrapped in his comforterâs warm arms his woes are soon beguiled.


78. Watching oâer him, poor innocent, lest wind or heat annoy,

His fostering nurse she may be called, to cherish thus her boy.


79. What gear his sire and mother have she hoards for him, âMay be,â

She thinks, âsome day, my dearest child, it all may come to youâ.
 [5.174]


80. âDo this or that, my darling boy,â the worried mother cries,

And when heâs grown to manâs estate, she still laments and sighs.


81. He goes in reckless mood to see a neighbourâs wife at night,

She fumes and frets, âWhy will he not return while it is lightâ?

If one thus reared with anxious pains his mother should neglect,

Playing her false, what doom, I pray, but hell can he expect?


82. If one thus reared with anxious pains his father should neglect,

Playing him false, what doom, I pray, but hell can he expect?


83. Those that love wealth oâermuch, âtis said, their wealth will soon have lost,

One that neglects a mother soon will rue it to his cost.


84. Those that love wealth oâermuch, âtis said, their wealth will soon have lost,

One that neglects a father soon will rue it to his cost.


85. Joy, careless ease, laughter and sport, are the sure heritage

Of him that studiously shall tend a mother in old age.


86. Joy, careless ease, laughter and sport, are the sure heritage

Of him that studiously shall tend a father in old age.


87. Gifts, 
Childers gives the four 
Saá¹gahavatthu
, appertaining to kings, as: largesse, affability, beneficent rule, and impartiality.
 loving speech, kind offices, together with the grace

Of calm indifference of mind shown in due time and place â


88. These virtues to the world are as linch-pin to chariot wheel,

These lacking, still a motherâs name to children would appeal.
 {5.331}


89. A mother like the sire should be with reverent honour crowned,

Sages approve the man in whom these virtues may be found.


90. Thus parents, worthy of all praise, a high position own,

By ancient sages Brahma called â so great was their renown.


91. Kind parents from their children should receive all reverence due,

He that is wise will honour them with service good and true.


92. He should provide them food and drink, bedding and raiment meet,

Should bathe and anoint with oil and duly wash their feet.


93. For filial services like these sages his praises sound

Here in this world, and after death in heaven his joys abound.â
 {5.332}

The Teacher here ended his lesson and revealing the Truths identified the JÄtaka. At the end of the Truths the monk who cherished his mother was established in the fruition of the First Path. âAt that time the parents were members of the great kingâs court, the sage Nanda was Änanda, king Manoja was SÄriputta, the hundred and one kings were eighty chief elders and certain others, the twenty-four complete armies were Buddhaâs disciples, but the sage Sona was I myself.â

This was a story told by the Teacher, while dwelling in the Bamboo Grove, as to how the venerable Änanda renounced his life. For when archers were instigated to slay the TathÄgata, and the first one that was sent by Devadatta 
For the story of Devadatta, cf. 
Cullavagga,
 vii.
 on this errand returned and said: âVenerable sir, I cannot deprive the Fortunate One of life: he is possessed of great Supernormal Powers,â Devadatta replied, âWell, sir, you need not slay the ascetic Gotama. I myself will deprive him of life.â And as the TathÄgata was walking in the shadow cast westward 
In the corresponding passage in 
Cullavagga,
 vii. 3. 8,

 by the Vultureâs Peak, Devadatta climbed to the top of the mountain and hurled a mighty stone as if shot from a catapult, thinking: âWith this stone will I slay the ascetic Gotama,â but two mountain peaks meeting together intercepted the stone, and a splinter from it flew up and struck the Fortunate One on the foot and drew blood, and severe pains set in. JÄ«vaka, cutting open the TathÄgataâs foot with a knife, let out the bad blood and removed the proud flesh, and anointing the wound with medicine, healed it.


The Teacher moved about just as he did before, surrounded by his attendants, with all the great charm of a Buddha. So on seeing him Devadatta thought: âVerily no mortal beholding the excellent beauty of Gotamaâs person dare approach him, but the kingâs elephant NÄá¸·Ägiri is a fierce and 
{5.334}
 savage animal and knows nothing of the virtues of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saá¹gha. He will bring about the destruction of the ascetic.â So he went and told the matter to the king. The king readily fell in with the suggestion, and, summoning his elephant-keeper, thus addressed him, âSir, tomorrow you are to make NÄá¸·Ägiri mad with drink, and at break of day to let him loose in the street where the ascetic Gotama walks.â And Devadatta asked the keeper how much arrack the elephant was wont to drink on ordinary days, and when he answered, âEight pots,â he said: âTomorrow give him sixteen pots to drink, and send him in the direction of the street frequented by the ascetic Gotama.â âVery good,â said the keeper. The king had a drum beaten throughout the city and proclaimed, âTomorrow NÄá¸·Ägiri will be maddened with strong drink and let loose in the city. The men of the city are to do all that they have to do in the early morning and after that no one is to venture out into the street.â


And Devadatta came down 
[5.176]
 from the palace and went to the elephant stall and, addressing the keepers, said: âWe are able, I tell you, from a high position to degrade a man to a lowly one and to raise a man from a low position to a high one. If you are eager for honour, early tomorrow morning give NÄá¸·Ägiri sixteen pots of fiery liquor, and at the time when the ascetic Gotama comes that way, wound the elephant with spiked goads, and when in his fury he has broken down his stall, drive him in the direction of the street where Gotama is wont to walk, and so bring about the destruction of the ascetic.â They readily agreed to do so.


This rumour was noised abroad throughout the whole city. The lay disciples attached to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saá¹gha, on hearing it, drew near to the Teacher and said: âVenerable sir, Devadatta has conspired with the king and tomorrow he will have NÄá¸·Ägiri let loose in the street where you walk. Do not go into the city tomorrow for alms but remain here. We will provide food in the monastery for the monastics, with Buddha at their head.â The Teacher without directly saying: âI will not enter the city tomorrow for alms,â answered and said: âTomorrow I will work a miracle and tame NÄá¸·Ägiri and crush the heretics. And without going around for alms in RÄjagaha I will leave the city, attended by a company of the monks, and go straight to the Bamboo Grove, and the people of RÄjagaha shall repair there with many a bowl of food and tomorrow there shall be a meal provided in the refectory of the monastery.â In this way did the Teacher grant their request.


And on learning that the TathÄgata had acceded to their wishes, they set out from the city, carrying bowls of food, and saying: âWe will distribute our gifts in the monastery itself.â And the Teacher in the first watch taught the Dhamma, in the middle watch he solved hard questions, in the first part of the last watch he lay down lion-like on his right side, and the second part 
{5.335}
 he spent in the Attainment of Fruition, in the third part, entering into a trance of deep pity for the sufferings of humanity, he contemplated all his kinsfolk that were ripe for conversion

 and seeing that as the result of his conquest of NÄá¸·Ägiri eighty-four thousand beings would be brought to a clear understanding of the Dhamma, at daybreak, after attending to his bodily necessities, he addressed Änanda and said: âÄnanda, today bid all the monks that are in the eighteen monasteries that are round about RÄjagaha to accompany me into the city.â The elder did so, and all the monks assembled at the Bamboo Grove.


The Teacher attended by a great company of monks entered RÄjagaha and the elephant-keepers proceeded according to their instructions and there was a great gathering of people. The believers thought: âToday there will be a mighty battle between the Buddha NÄga and this elephant NÄga of the brute world. We shall witness the defeat of NÄá¸·Ägiri by the incomparable skill of the Buddha,â and they climbed up and stood upon the upper storeys and roofs and house-tops. But the unbelieving heretics thought: âNÄá¸·Ägiri is a fierce, savage creature, and knows nothing of the merits of Buddhas and the like. Today he will crush the glorious form of the ascetic Gotama and bring about his death. Today we shall look upon the back of our enemy.â And they took their stand on upper storeys and other high places.


And the elephant, on seeing the Fortunate One approach him, terrified the people by demolishing the houses and raising his trunk he crushed the wagons into powder, and, with his ears and tail erect with excitement, he ran like some towering mountain in the direction of the Fortunate One. On seeing him the monks thus addressed the Fortunate One, âThis NÄá¸·Ägiri, venerable sir, a fierce and savage creature, and a slayer of men, is coming along this road.

 i. 346. 18.
 Of a truth he knows nothing of the merit of Buddhas and the like. Let the Fortunate One, the Auspicious One, withdraw.â âFear not, monks,â he said: âI am able to overcome NÄá¸·Ägiri.â Then the venerable SÄriputta prayed the Teacher, saying: âVenerable sir, when any service has to be rendered to a father, it is a burden laid on his eldest son. I will vanquish this creature.â Then the Teacher said: âSÄriputta, the power of a Buddha is one thing, that of his disciples is another,â and he rejected his offer, 
[5.177]
 saying: âYou are to remain here.â This too was the prayer of the eighty chief elders for the most part, but he refused them all.


Then the venerable Änanda by reason of his strong affection for the Teacher was unable to acquiesce in this and cried, âLet this elephant kill me first,â and he stood before the Teacher, ready to sacrifice his life for the TathÄgata. So the Teacher said to him, âGo away, Änanda, do not stand in front of me.â The elder said: âVenerable sir, this elephant 
{5.336}
 is fierce and savage, a slayer of men, like the flame at the beginning of a cycle. Let him first slay me and afterwards let him approach you.â And though he was spoken to for the third time, the elder remained in the same spot and did not retire. Then the Fortunate One by the exercise of his Supernormal Powers made him fall back and placed him in the midst of the monks.


At this moment a certain woman, catching sight of NÄá¸·Ägiri, was terrified with the fear of death, and as she fled she dropped her child, which she was carrying on her hip, between the TathÄgata and the elephant and made her escape. The elephant, pursuing the woman, came up to the child, who uttered a loud cry. The Teacher, having spread his special loving-kindness, 
odissakamettÄ.
 cf. 
JÄtaka
 ii. 61. 9, ii. 146. 13.
 and uttering the honeyed accents of a voice like that of Brahma, called to NÄá¸·Ägiri, saying: âHo! NÄá¸·Ägiri, those that maddened you with sixteen pots of arrack did not do this that you might attack someone else, but acted thus thinking you would attack me. Do not tire out your strength by rushing about aimlessly but come here.â


On hearing the voice of the Teacher he opened his eyes and beheld the glorious form of the Fortunate One, and he became greatly agitated and by the power of Buddha the intoxicating effects of the strong drink passed off. Dropping his trunk and shaking his ears he came and fell down at the feet of the TathÄgata. Then the Teacher addressing him said: âNÄá¸·Ägiri, you are a brute elephant, I am the Buddha elephant. Henceforth be not fierce and savage, nor a slayer of men, but cultivate thoughts of generosity.â So saying he stretched forth his right hand and coaxed the elephantâs forehead and taught the Dhamma to him in these words:

âThis elephant 
These verses occur in 
Cullavagga,
 vii. 3. 12.
 should you presume to assail,

An awful doom you would erelong bewail.


To strike this elephant would destine you

To state of suffering in worlds to be.


From mad and foolish recklessness abstain,

The reckless fool to heaven will neâer attain.


If in the next world you would win heavenâs bliss,

See that you do what is right in this.â

The whole body of the elephant constantly thrilled with joy, and had he not been a mere animal, he would have entered on the fruition of the First Path. The people, on beholding this miracle, shouted and snapped their fingers. In their joy they cast upon him all manner of ornaments and covered therewith all the body of the elephant. 
{5.337}
 Thenceforth NÄá¸·Ägiri was known as DhanapÄlaka (keeper of treasure).


Now on the occasion of this encounter with DhanapÄlaka eighty-four thousand beings drank the nectar of immortality. And the Teacher established DhanapÄlaka in the Five Precepts. With his trunk taking up dust from the feet of the Fortunate One the elephant sprinkled it on his head, and retiring with bent body he stood bowing to the One with Ten Powers as long as he was in sight, and then he turned and entered the elephant stall. Thenceforth he was quite tame and harmed no man.


The Teacher, now that his desire was fulfilled, decided that the treasure should remain the property of those by whom it had been thrown upon the elephant and thinking: âToday I have wrought a great miracle. It is not seemly that I should go my rounds for alms in this city,â and after crushing the heretics, surrounded by a band of the monks, he sallied forth from the city like a victorious warrior chief and made 
[5.178]
 straight for the Bamboo Grove. The citizens, taking with them a quantity of boiled rice, drink, and some solid food, went to the monastery and gave an almsgiving on a grand scale.


That day at eventide, as they sat filling the Dhamma Hall, the monks started a topic, saying: âThe venerable Änanda achieved a marvellous thing in being ready to sacrifice his life for the sake of the TathÄgata. On seeing NÄá¸·Ägiri, though he was thrice forbidden by the Teacher to remain, he refused to go away. O sirs, of a truth the elder was the doer of a marvellous deed.â The Teacher, thinking: âThe conversation turns on the merits of Änanda, I must be present at it,â went forth from his Perfumed Chamber and came and asked them, saying: âOn what subject are you discoursing, monks, as you sit here?â And when they answered, âOn such and such a topic,â he said: âNot only now, but formerly too, Änanda, even when he was born in an animal form, renounced his life for my sake,â and so saying he told a story of the past.

1. âAll other birds, heedless of me, have fled in haste away;

What friendship can a captive know? Be off, make no delay.â

2. âWhether I go or stay with you, I still some day must die:

Iâve courted you in weal, in woe from you I may not fly.â


3. âI either then must die with you, or live a life forlorn,

Far better âtwere to die at once than live your loss to mourn.â


4. âIt is not right to leave you, sire, in such a sorry state;

Nay, I am well content to share whateâer may be your fate.â


5. âWhat fate for one caught in a snare except the cruel spit?

How in your senses and still free could you to this submit?â


6. âWhat good for you or me, O bird, herein do you descry,

Or for the kin surviving us, if both of us should die?


7. Wrapped, golden-wingÃ¨d one, in night will be your deed of worth;

What moral would such sacrifice, if brought to light, show forth?â


8. âThat blessings follow Dhamma, O king of birds, do you not see?

Right duly honoured shows to men what their true good may be.
 {5.340}


9. Seeing Dhamma and all the good that still from Dhamma spring,

For love of you I cheerfully my life away would fling.


10. If mindful of Dhamma one neâer forsakes a suffering friend,

Not eâen to save oneâs life, such as Dhamma the wise commend.â


11. âYour duty nobly done, the while I recognise your love,

Depart at once, if you would do the thing I most approve.â


12. âPerhaps in time the ties that bound my kin beneath my sway,

With fuller knowledge and control may pass to you some day.â


13. As thus these noble birds exchanged high thoughts, to them, behold,

Like death to some bedridden wretch appeared this fowler bold.


14. The friends in him discerning well the enemy they fear,

Long silent sat and motionless, as he to them drew near.


15. Seeing the geese rise here and there and vanish into space,

Their foe, where sat these noble birds, in haste approached the place.


16. And as he ran with utmost speed and reached the fated spot,

The fowler, trembling at the thought, cried, âAre they caught or not?â


17. The one he saw caught in the snare, the other bird he found

Watching his captive friend, himself unfettered and unbound.
 [5.180]


18. Perplexed and doubting in his mind he viewed the noble pair,

â Full grown were they, two comely birds â and thus he spake them fair.


19. âGranted that one caught in a snare may never fly away, 
kurute disaá¹,

 as required by the metre.

Why, mighty bird, do you, still free, resolve with him to stay?


20. What is this fowl to you, that when the rest are fled and gone,

Though free, beside the captive bird you sittest here alone?â


21. âO foe of birds, 
This couplet occurs in iv. p. 265, English version.
 my friend and king, dear as my life is he;

Forsake him â no, I never will, until death calls for me.â
 {5.341}


22. âHow was it that this bird neâer spied the fowlerâs secret snare?

Of mighty chiefs the function is of danger to be ware.â


23. âWhen ruin comes 
This couplet occurs three times before. See note on vol. iv. p. 265, English version.
 upon a man and deathâs hour draweth nigh,

Though you may close upon it come, nor trap nor snare you spy.


24. Snares of all kinds, O holy ones, are ofttimes set in vain:

In fatal hour at last oneâs caught in hidden snare and slain.â

And will you, pray you, spare our lives and let us both go free?â

26. âNo prisoner of mine are you; begone, quick, hence away;

I would not shed your blood; unscathed, live on for many a day.â

27. âI should not care to live myself, if this my friend were dead,

Content with one, let him go free, and eat my flesh instead.


28. We two are much the same in age, in length and breadth of limb;

No loss for you, if you should take me in exchange for him.


29. Regard it in this light and glut your appetite on me;

First bind me in the snare, then let this king of birds go free.


30. Thus you would gain your wish and I my heartâs desire secure,

And peace would be âtwixt geese and you, long as life should endure.â

31. âBe witness all your sages, friends, servants, and kith and kin,

Through you alone this king of birds his liberty did win.


32. To few âtis given to own a friend like you prepared to share

A common fate, as when your king was caught in deadly snare.


33. So I release your friend the king, to follow you afar,

Quick, hence away, amidst your kin to shine fair as a star.â
 [5.181] {5.344}

34. âThe goose glad at the kingâs release, in honour of his lord,

Thus charmed his benefactorâs ear with this most pleasant word:


35. âFowler, with all your kith and kin, right happy may you be,

As I am happy to behold the king of birds set free.â â

36. âCome, I will teach you how you may win for thyself great gain,

Seeing the honour of this goose brooks not the slightest stain.


37. Quick, take us to the royal court, in body sound and whole,

Standing, unbound, at either end of this your carrying-pole.


38. And say, âO sire, lo! here to you two ruddy geese we bring,

The one is captain of the host, the other is their king.â


39. This lord of men beholding then this royal goose will be

So glad and overjoyed, he will great wealth bestow on thee.â
 [5.182]

40. âOn hearing this he wrought the thing they craved in heart and soul,

And quickly took the geese to court, in body sound and whole,

Standing, unbound, one at each end of his long carrying-pole.


41. âLo! Here,â he said, âtwo ruddy geese, O sire, to you we bring,

One is the captain of the host, the other is their king.â


42. âHow did these wingÃ¨d mighty ones, fowler, become your prey,

How did you creep close up to them, nor frighten them away?â


43. âO lord of men, in every pool behold a trap or net,

 haunt of birds, I think, a deadly snare was set.


44. âTwas in some hidden trap like this I caught the king of geese,

His friend, still free, sat by his side and sought his lordâs release.


45. This bird attempted a task beyond what vulgar souls achieve,

Resolved his every nerve to strain, his master to relieve.


46. There sat he, worthy to survive, content his life to give,

If but his lord, whose praise he sang, might be allowed to live.


47. Hearing his words I all at once attained to state of grace,

Gladly set free the captive bird and bade them leave the place.


48. The goose, rejoiced at his release, in honour of his lord,

Thus charmed his benefactorâs ear with this most pleasant word:


49. âFowler, with all your kith and kin, right happy may you be,

As I am happy to behold the king of birds set free.


50. Come, I will teach you how you may win for thyself great gain,

Seeing the honour of this goose brooks not the slightest stain.


51. Quick, take us to the royal court, in body sound and whole,

Standing, unbound, at either end of this your carrying-pole.


52. And say, âO sire, lo! here to you two ruddy geese we bring,

The one is captain of the host, the other is their king.


53. This lord of men, beholding then this royal goose will be

So glad and overjoyed, he will great wealth bestow on you.â
 [5.183] {5.347}


54. Thus at his bidding hither led by me the pair have come,

Although for me they both were free to seek their mountain home.


55. Such was the fate of this poor bird, though very righteous he,

So much that he with pity moved a fowler fierce like me.


56. This goose, O lord of men, to you an offering bring I here,

Amidst the haunts of fowling men one scarce could find his peer.â â â
 {5.348}

57. âSeeing the king now seated on a lovely golden chair,

The goose in tones to charm the ear thus did bespeak him fair:


58. âDo you, my lord, enjoy good health and is all well with you?

I trust your realm is flourishing and ruled in equity.â


59. âO king of geese, my health is good and all is well with me;

My realm is very flourishing and ruled in equity.â


60. âHave you true men to counsel you, free from all stain or blame,

Ready to die, if need there be, for your good cause and name?â


61. âI have true men to counsel me, free from all stain or blame,

Ready to die, if need there be, for my good cause and name.â


62. âHave you a wife of equal birth, obedient, kind in word,

With children blessed, good looks, fair name, compliant with her lord?â


63. âI have a wife of equal birth, obedient, kind in word,

With children blessed, good looks, fair name, compliant with her lord.â â
 {5.349}

64. âWhen some mischance delivered you to your most deadly foe,

Did you then at his hands, O bird, great suffering undergo?


65. Did he run up and with his stick belabour you, I pray?

Of such vile creatures, as I hear, this ever is the way.â


66. âI never was in danger, as I gratefully recall,

Nor did he deal with us as foes in any way at all.


67. The fowler, trembling and amazed, to question us was fain,

And Sumukha, wisest of birds, made answer back again.


68. Hearing his words he all at once attained to state of grace,

Gladly released me from the snare, and bade us leave the place.
 [5.184]


69. To come and visit you, O king, was Sumukhaâs desire,

Thinking our friend the fowler thus great riches might acquire.â


70. âYou are right welcome, sirs, be sure, Iâm glad to see you here,

And let your fowler friend receive his fill of earthly gear.â
 {5.350}

71. âThe king with riches manifold the fowler amply blessed,

And then in tones that charmed the ear the ruddy goose addressed.â

72. âWhateâer I lawfully possess, whateâer I duly claim,

Shall pass beneath your sway, if you your heartâs desire will name.


73. Whether for alms or to enjoy and use it for your own,

To you I yield my gear and all, to you resign my throne.â

74. âIf wise and learned Sumukha would speak of his free will

A word or two, my happiness would then be greater still.â

75. âI could not in your presence, with propriety, my lord,

As though I were some NÄga prince, utter a single word.


76. For this the chief of ruddy geese, and you, O mighty king,

On many grounds may rightly claim the homages that I bring.


77. I a mere underling, my lord, may scarcely intervene,

When high debate is being held your majesties between.â
 [5.185]

78. âThe fowler rightly praised this bird as wise beyond its kind:

Such prudence is not found in one undisciplined

80. Your noble form and sweet discourse cast oâer me such a spell,

My only wish is that you both long time with me may dwell.â
 {5.352}

81. âYou have dealt with us as a man deals with his dearest friend:

Such was the kindness, sir, you did to us poor birds extend.


82. Yet a great void the circle of our kin has to deplore,

And many a bird is sorely grieved to see our face no more.


83. To drive away their sorrow you, O king, have set us free,

So humbly taking leave we fly our friends once more to see.


84. Iâm very glad acquaintance with your highness to have made,

Henceforth, I trust, my friends may have less cause to be afraid.â

85. âThus to the lord of mortals spake the Dhataraá¹­á¹­ha king,

Then sought these geese their kith and kin with utmost speed of wing.


86. Seeing their chiefs all safe and sound returned from haunts of men,

The wingÃ¨d flock with noisy cries welcomed them back again.


87. Thus circling round their lord in whom they trust, these ruddy geese

Paid all due honour to their king, rejoiced at his release.â

88. âThus all whose hearts are full of love succeed in what they do,

Eâen as these geese back to their friends once more in safety flew.â 
{5.354}

The Teacher here ended his story, saying: âMonks, not only now, but of old also, Änanda for my sake renounced his life,â and he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time Channa was the fowler, SÄriputta the king, Änanda was Sumukha, the followers of Buddha the ninety thousand geese, and I myself was the goose-king.â

Änanda = (the faithful goose) Sumukha,

SÄriputta = the king (of Benares) (rÄjÄ),

the nun = (queen) KhemÄ,

Channa = the hunter (luddaka),

## Full Story
âThere go the birds.â
 This story the Teacher, while residing in the Bamboo Grove, told concerning the elder Änandaâs renunciation of life. The introductory story is exactly like the one already given. 
[In the story before this one, Ja 533 
Cullahaá¹sajÄtaka
. I include the story here.]

This was a story told by the Teacher, while dwelling in the Bamboo Grove, as to how the venerable Änanda renounced his life. For when archers were instigated to slay the TathÄgata, and the first one that was sent by Devadatta on this errand returned and said: âVenerable sir, I cannot deprive the Fortunate One of life: he is possessed of great Supernormal Powers,â Devadatta replied, âWell, sir, you need not slay the ascetic Gotama. I myself will deprive him of life.â And as the TathÄgata was walking in the shadow cast westward by the Vultureâs Peak, Devadatta climbed to the top of the mountain and hurled a mighty stone as if shot from a catapult, thinking: âWith this stone will I slay the ascetic Gotama,â but two mountain peaks meeting together intercepted the stone, and a splinter from it flew up and struck the Fortunate One on the foot and drew blood, and severe pains set in. JÄ«vaka, cutting open the TathÄgataâs foot with a knife, let out the bad blood and removed the proud flesh, and anointing the wound with medicine, healed it.


The Teacher moved about just as he did before, surrounded by his attendants, with all the great charm of a Buddha. So on seeing him Devadatta thought: âVerily no mortal beholding the excellent beauty of Gotamaâs person dare approach him, but the kingâs elephant NÄá¸·Ägiri is a fierce and savage animal and knows nothing of the virtues of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saá¹gha. He will bring about the destruction of the ascetic.â So he went and told the matter to the king. The king readily fell in with the suggestion, and, summoning his elephant-keeper, thus addressed him, âSir, tomorrow you are to make NÄá¸·Ägiri mad with drink, and at break of day to let him loose in the street where the ascetic Gotama walks.â And Devadatta asked the keeper how much arrack the elephant was wont to drink on ordinary days, and when he answered, âEight pots,â he said: âTomorrow give him sixteen pots to drink, and send him in the direction of the street frequented by the ascetic Gotama.â âVery good,â said the keeper. The king had a drum beaten throughout the city and proclaimed, âTomorrow NÄá¸·Ägiri will be maddened with strong drink and let loose in the city. The men of the city are to do all that they have to do in the early morning and after that no one is to venture out into the street.â


And Devadatta came down from the palace and went to the elephant stall and, addressing the keepers, said: âWe are able, I tell you, from a high position to degrade a man to a lowly one and to raise a man from a low position to a high one. If you are eager for honour, early tomorrow morning give NÄá¸·Ägiri sixteen pots of fiery liquor, and at the time when the ascetic Gotama comes that way, wound the elephant with spiked goads, and when in his fury he has broken down his stall, drive him in the direction of the street where Gotama is wont to walk, and so bring about the destruction of the ascetic.â They readily agreed to do so.


This rumour was noised abroad throughout the whole city. The lay disciples attached to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saá¹gha, on hearing it, drew near to the Teacher and said: âVenerable sir, Devadatta has conspired with the king and tomorrow he will have NÄá¸·Ägiri let loose in the street where you walk. Do not go into the city tomorrow for alms but remain here. We will provide food in the monastery for the monastics, with Buddha at their head.â The Teacher without directly saying: âI will not enter the city tomorrow for alms,â answered and said: âTomorrow I will work a miracle and tame NÄá¸·Ägiri and crush the heretics. And without going around for alms in RÄjagaha I will leave the city, attended by a company of the monks, and go straight to the Bamboo Grove, and the people of RÄjagaha shall repair there with many a bowl of food and tomorrow there shall be a meal provided in the refectory of the monastery.â In this way did the Teacher grant their request.


And on learning that the TathÄgata had acceded to their wishes, they set out from the city, carrying bowls of food, and saying: âWe will distribute our gifts in the monastery itself.â And the Teacher in the first watch taught the Dhamma, in the middle watch he solved hard questions, in the first part of the last watch he lay down lion-like on his right side, and the second part he spent in the Attainment of Fruition, in the third part, entering into a trance of deep pity for the sufferings of humanity, he contemplated all his kinsfolk that were ripe for conversion and seeing that as the result of his conquest of NÄá¸·Ägiri eighty-four thousand beings would be brought to a clear understanding of the Dhamma, at daybreak, after attending to his bodily necessities, he addressed Änanda and said: âÄnanda, today bid all the monks that are in the eighteen monasteries that are round about RÄjagaha to accompany me into the city.â The elder did so, and all the monks assembled at the Bamboo Grove.


The Teacher attended by a great company of monks entered RÄjagaha and the elephant-keepers proceeded according to their instructions and there was a great gathering of people. The believers thought: âToday there will be a mighty battle between the Buddha NÄga and this elephant NÄga of the brute world. We shall witness the defeat of NÄá¸·Ägiri by the incomparable skill of the Buddha,â and they climbed up and stood upon the upper storeys and roofs and house-tops. But the unbelieving heretics thought: âNÄá¸·Ägiri is a fierce, savage creature, and knows nothing of the merits of Buddhas and the like. Today he will crush the glorious form of the ascetic Gotama and bring about his death. Today we shall look upon the back of our enemy.â And they took their stand on upper storeys and other high places.


And the elephant, on seeing the Fortunate One approach him, terrified the people by demolishing the houses and raising his trunk he crushed the wagons into powder, and, with his ears and tail erect with excitement, he ran like some towering mountain in the direction of the Fortunate One. On seeing him the monks thus addressed the Fortunate One, âThis NÄá¸·Ägiri, venerable sir, a fierce and savage creature, and a slayer of men, is coming along this road. Of a truth he knows nothing of the merit of Buddhas and the like. Let the Fortunate One, the Auspicious One, withdraw.â âFear not, monks,â he said: âI am able to overcome NÄá¸·Ägiri.â Then the venerable SÄriputta prayed the Teacher, saying: âVenerable sir, when any service has to be rendered to a father, it is a burden laid on his eldest son. I will vanquish this creature.â Then the Teacher said: âSÄriputta, the power of a Buddha is one thing, that of his disciples is another,â and he rejected his offer, saying: âYou are to remain here.â This too was the prayer of the eighty chief elders for the most part, but he refused them all.


Then the venerable Änanda by reason of his strong affection for the Teacher was unable to acquiesce in this and cried, âLet this elephant kill me first,â and he stood before the Teacher, ready to sacrifice his life for the TathÄgata. So the Teacher said to him, âGo away, Änanda, do not stand in front of me.â The elder said: âVenerable sir, this elephant is fierce and savage, a slayer of men, like the flame at the beginning of a cycle. Let him first slay me and afterwards let him approach you.â And though he was spoken to for the third time, the elder remained in the same spot and did not retire. Then the Fortunate One by the exercise of his Supernormal Powers made him fall back and placed him in the midst of the monks.

But on this occasion the Teacher in telling a story of the past related the following tale.

1. âThere go the birds, the ruddy geese, all overcome with fear,

O golden-yellow Sumukha, depart! What would you here?


2. My kith and kin deserted me, away they all have flown;

Without a thought they fly away. Why are you left alone?


3. Fly, noble bird, with prisoners what fellowship can be?

Sumukha, fly! Nor lose the chance,

Of all your host, O noble king, famed as the leader bold.

Women in this world are born, destined to great power and fame.

Seeds within them germinate, source from whence all lifeâs sustained,

They from whom man draws his breath scarce by man may be disdained.

Did you only, moved by fear, this belated wisdom find?

In a crisis sages all strive to shelter us from harm.

And, standing fast in virtues ten, the next world never dread.â

Peace, mercy, patience, generosity, with morals undefiled â


89. These graces firmly planted in my soul are clear to see,

Whence springs rich harvest of great joy and happiness for me.


90. But Sumukha though knowing nought of evil we had done,

Right heedlessly gave vent to words in harsh and angry tone.


91. Things I knew not were to my charge by this bird wrongly laid,

In language harsh. Herein, I think, scant wisdom was displayed.â â

92. âI did wrong against you, lord of men, and words of rashness spake,

Ivory, yellow sandalwood, deer skins and costly dress,

97. âSince you are fain to honour us, be pleased, O lord of men,

To be our teacher, teaching us those royal virtues ten.


98. And then if your approval and consent we haply win,

We would take formal leave of you, and go to see our kin.â

99. âThe livelong night in deepest thought the king of KÄsi spent,

Then to that noble birdâs request straight yielded his consent.â

101. âSeeing their chiefs all safe and sound returned from haunts of men,

The wingÃ¨d flock with noisy cries welcomed them back again.


102. Thus circling round their lord in whom they trust, these ruddy geese

Paid all due honour to their king, rejoiced at his release.â

103. âThus all whose hearts are full of love succeed in what they do,

Eâen as these geese back to their friends once more in safety flew.â

The Teacher here ended his story and identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the fowler was Channa, queen KhemÄ was the nun KhemÄ, the king was SÄriputta, the kingâs retinue the followers of Buddha, Sumukha was Änanda, and the goose-king was I myself.â

## Full Story
âNo huckster I.â
 This was a story told by the Teacher, while dwelling at Jetavana, concerning a liberal minded monk. He was said to be a man of gentle birth, living at SÄvatthi, who after hearing the Dhamma preached by the Teacher was converted and adopted the ascetic life. Being perfected in the moral virtues and furnished with the ascetic precepts

 iii. 483. 13. [i.e. it indicates he practiced the thirteen 
dhutaá¹gas
, or ascetic practices.] 
 and with a heart full of love for his fellow monastics he thrice every day zealously ministered to the service of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saá¹gha, and showed himself exemplary in conduct 
[5.203]
 and devoted to generosity. Fulfilling the obligations of kindly civility,

 see Senartâs 
MahÄvastu,
 vol. i. p. 599, 
JÄtaka
 vi. 224. 8.
 whatever he received, so long as there were any recipients, he would give away till he was himself without food. And his liberality and charitable disposition were noised abroad in the Saá¹gha of monks.


So one day the topic was started in the Dhamma Hall, how that a certain monk was so liberal minded and devoted to generosity that if he received only sufficient drink to fill the hollow of the hand, free from all greed, he would give it to his fellow monastics â his will being even as that of a Bodhisatta.


The Teacher by his divine sense of hearing caught what they were saying, and issuing forth from his Perfumed Chamber, drew nigh and asked what was the nature of their discussion. And when they answered, âIt was so and so,â he said: âThis monk of old, monks, was far from liberal, nay, so stingy that he would not give so much as a drop of oil on the tip of a blade of grass. So I converted and made him self-denying and by praising the fruits of generosity I firmly established him in almsgiving; so that on receiving water just enough to fill the hollow of the hand he would say, âI will not drink a drop without giving some away,â and he received a boon at my hands, and as a result of his almsgiving he became liberal minded and devoted to generosity,â and with these words he told a story of the past.

1. âNo huckster I to buy or vend,

No stores are mine to give or lend:

This dole of rice âtwas hard to gain,

âTis scarce enough to serve us twain.â

From much give much, of giving nought no question can arise.

Eat not alone, no bliss is his that by himself shall dine,

By generosity you may ascend the noble path divine.â

Should you eat food and grudge to give your guest some little part.

Eat not alone, no bliss is his that by himself shall dine,

By generosity you may ascend the noble path divine.â

Should you not eat your food alone, but give your guest a part.

And MÄtali the heavenly charioteer,

I Sakka am, chief god of Thirty-Three,

15. âWith tabour, drum, and tambourine they rouse him from his sleep,

And as he wakes, glad music makes his heart with joy to leap.â

16. âWhoeâer are miserly niggards born,

Or monks and holy brahmins scorn,

Their earthly frame now laid aside,

In hell, dissolved by death, abide.â

17. âSteadfast in right who heaven would win

Give alms and keep themselves from sin,

And, with their body laid aside

By deathâs decay, in heaven abide.â

18. âYou, though to us in former births akin,

A miser are, a man of wrath and sin;

âTis for your sake we have come down to earth,

To avert from you sinâs doom â in hell rebirth.â

19. âIn that you thus admonish me, you doubtless seek my good,

I too will follow your advice, so far as understood.

These nymphs, great Sakkaâs care, delight;

To them a saint of world-wide fame

23. This bough with flowers so pure and sweet

Is deemed for immortals meet:

No DÄnava, none of mortal birth

Can claim this flower of priceless worth.


24. Then Faith, Hope, Glory, Honour, those

Four maids with skins like gold, arose,

And, peerless âmidst all nymphs confessed,

The brahmin NÄrada addressed,


25. Give us, O sage, this coral flower,

If still to give is in your power,

As Sakkaâs self weâll honour thee,

And you in all things blessed shall be.


26. When NÄrada their prayer had heard,

He straight a mighty quarrel stirred:

I need it not; whom you allow

To be your queen shall claim the bough.â
 {5.394}

27. âO NÄrada, supreme are you,

On whom you will the boon bestow:

Whom you shall with such gift invest,

Amongst us shall be counted best.â

What brahmin strife would dare excite?

29. âWith pride of beauty mad and rage

Excited by the cunning sage, 
[5.211]

To Sakka, lord of gods, they go,

Who âmongst them all is best to know.â 
{5.395}

30. âThese Devas so earnest in their quest

Sakka with due respect addressed,

You all in beauty equal are,

Who thus with strife your peace would mar?â

31. âNÄrada, world-traversing, a sage of might,

Truth-piercing, steadfast ever in the right,

Thus spake to us on GandhamÄdanaâs height;

To Sakka, King of Devas, straightway go,

If who is first or last you fain would know.â

Will not unshared touch any food;

To whom he gives, first place is hers.â

34. âAt Devaâs behest went MÄtali,

On a car with a thousand steeds rode he;

Unseen he soon by the hermitage stood

And offered the sage ambrosial food.â

35. âA flame of sacrifice while I did raise, 
With 
udaggihutta
 compare 
udÄyudha,
 with uplifted weapon.

The sun that drives away all gloom to praise,

Sakka supreme oâer spirit-world that stands â

Who else? Ambrosia placed within my hands. 
[5.212]


36. White like a pearl was it, beyond compare,

Fragrant and pure, and marvellously fair,

Never before seen by these eyes of mine;

What god puts in my hands this food divine?â

37. âI come, O mighty sage, by Sakka sent,

In haste to bring you heavenly nutriment:

This best of food, pray, eat without all fear,

You seest here MÄtali, heavenâs charioteer.


38. By eating this twelve evil things are slain,

Thirst, hunger, discontent, fatigue, and pain,

Cold, heat, rage, enmity, strife, slander, sloth â

This heavenly essence eat you, nothing loth.â

39. â âTwas wrong to eat alone I thought, so took a vow one day

To touch no food, unless I gave some part of it away.

To eat alone is neâer approved by men of noble mind,

Whoso with others does not share no happiness may find.â

40. âAll who commit adultery or womankind do slay,

Who holy men curse and revile or friendly souls betray,

And misers, worst of all â that I may neâer be ranked with such,

Not eâen a drop of water I unshared will ever touch. 
{5.398}


41. On men and women both alike my gifts shall ever flow,

Sages will praise all such as shall their goods in alms bestow;

All that are generous in this world and niggard ways eschew,

Approved by all, will ever be esteemed good men and true.â

42. âFour nymphs with golden forms so bright,

Hope, Glory, Faith, and Honour hight,

At Sakkaâs bidding earthward sent,

To Kosiyaâs cell their footsteps bent.


43. The maids with forms that glowed like flame

To each of earthâs four quarters came;

âFore MÄtali (now god confessed)

The sage oâerjoyed one thus addressed,


44. Who are you, nymph, like morning star,

Illuming Eastern skies afar? 
[5.213]

Your form in robe 
velli,
 which occurs also

 v. 402. 10, and 405. 2, is probably some part of dress. Compare

 of gold arrayed

Tell me your name, O heavenly maid. 
{5.399}


45. I Glory am, manâs honoured friend,

The sinless soul prompt to defend:

To claim this food, lo! here am I;

With this my prayer, great sage, comply.


46. I bliss confer on whom I will

And all his heartâs desire fulfil;

High priest, my name is Glory, know,

On me your heavenly food bestow.â

47. âMen may be skilful, virtuous, wise,

Excel in all their wits devise,

Yet without you they neâer succeed;

In this I blame your evil deed.


48. Another slothful, greedy, see,

Low-born and ugly as may be:

Blessed by your care and rich withal

He makes one nobly born his thrall.


49. You then as false and dull, Glory, I recognise,

Reckless in courting fools and laying low the wise;

No claim have you in truth to seat or waterpot,

Much less ambrosial food. Begone, I like you not.â
 {5.400}

50. âWho are you, maiden fair, with teeth so pure and white,

With rings of burnished gold and spangled bracelets dight,

In robe of watered sheen and wearing on your head

A sprig like ruddy flame by tufts of kusa fed?


51. Like a wild doe all but by hunterâs arrow grazed,

You look dull-eyed around as âtwere some creature dazed,

O softly-glancing maid, what comrade have you here,

That through lone forest glade you stray without a fear?â

52. âNo comrade have I here; from Sakkaâs heavenly home

MasakkasÄra called, DevatÄ-born I come:

To claim ambrosial food Hope now appears to you;

O hearken, noble sage, and grant this boon to me.â 
{5.401}

53. âMerchants through hope seek treasure far and wide,

And taking ship on oceanâs billows ride:

There sometimes do they sink to rise no more,

Or else escaping their lost wealth deplore.


54. In hope their fields the farmers plough and till,

Sow seeds and labour with their utmost skill;

But should some plague, or drought afflict the soil

No harvest will they reap for all their toil.


55. Ease-loving men, led on by hope, take heart

And for their lordâs sake play a manly part,

Oppressed by foes on every side they fall

And fighting for their lord lose life and all.


56. Grain-stores and wealth renouncing for their kin,

Through hope aspiring heavenly bliss to win,

Long time harsh penances they undergo,

And by bad ways attain to state of woe.


57. Deceiver of mankind, your suit is vain,

Your idle craving for this boon restrain,

No claim have you to seat or waterpot:

Much less to heavenly food. Begone, I like you not.â
 {5.402}

58. âFamed nymph in blaze of glory dressed,

Standing towards the ill-omened West,

Your form in robe of gold arrayed,

Tell me your name, illustrious maid.â

59. âMy name is Faith, manâs honoured friend,

The sinless soul prompt to defend:

To claim this food, lo! here am I;

With this my prayer, great sage, comply.â

60. âThrough faith at times men freely alms dispense,

Show self-control, restraint and abstinence: 
{5.403}

At times again through you from grace they fall,

Slander and lie and cheat and steal withal.


61. With wives, chaste, faithful, and of high degree,

A man may circumspect and prudent be,

May curb his passions well in such a case,

Yet in some harlot his whole trust may place.


62. Through you, O Faith, adultery is rife,

Forsaking 
riÃ±cati,
 
JÄtaka
 v. 146. 19.
 good you lead a sinful life.

No claim have you to seat or waterpot:

Much less ambrosial food. Begone, I like you not.â 
[5.215]

63. âLike Dawn that gilds the skirts of hateful Night,

So does your beauty burst upon my sight; 
{5.404}

O AccharÄ in form so passing fair,

Tell me your name and who you are declare.


64. Like to a tender plant 
ipomoea.
 whose roots are fed

On soil oâer which devouring flames

Georgics

 have spread,

Its wealth of scarlet leaves by summer breezes shed,

Why do you look at me with bashful air,

Fain as it were to speak, yet standing silent there?â

65. âHonour am I, manâs cherished friend,

Who aid to righteous mortals lend;

Lo here am I this food to claim,

Yet scarcely dare my wish to frame;

To woman suing counts as shame.â

66. âNo need for you to beg and sue,

Receive what is your right and due:

I grant the boon you did not crave,

Accept the food you fain would have. 
{5.405}


67. Deign, nymph, all golden clad, I pray,

To feast within my cell this day:

First honouring you with dainties rare,

I too this heavenly food would share.â

68. âThus Honour, glorious nymph, at his behest

In Kosiyaâs home was welcomed as a guest:

Fruits and perennial streams therein abound,

And thronging saints are in its precincts found.


69-70. Here flowering shrubs 
Many trees and plants only known by botanical names have been omitted.
 in a dense mass we see,

The mango, piyal, breadfruit, flaming tree;

Here SÄl and bright Jambu plum deck the glade,

There fig and banyan cast their holy shade.


70. Here many a flower with fragrance scents the wind,

Here peas and beans, panic and rice we find:

Bananas everywhere rich clusters show,

And bamboo reeds in thickest tangle grow.


72. On the north side, hemmed in by smooth and level bank,

And fed by purest streams, behold a sacred tank.


73. There happy fish 
The names of many fish, for the most part unknown, are omitted.
 in peace disport themselves at will,

And âmidst abundant food enjoy to take their fill.
 {5.406}


74. There happy birds in peace enjoy abundant fare,

Swans, herons, ospreys too, peacocks with plumage rare,

Cuckoos and pheasants eke with ruddy geese are there. 
[5.216]


75. Hither do lions, tigers, boars resort their thirst to slake.

This bears, hyenas, wolves are wont their drinking-place to make.


76. The buffalo, rhinoceros and gayal too are here,

With antelope, elk, herds of swine, and red and other deer,

And cats with ears like to a hareâs in numbers vast appear.


77. The mountain slopes are gaily pranked with flowers of varied shade

And echo to the song of birds that haunt each forest glade.â

78. âThe fair one leaning on a branch, all clothed with foliage green,

Like lightning front a thunder-cloud straight flashed upon the scene.

For her was set a dainty couch, 
For 
koccha

Vinaya Texts,
 translated by Davids and Oldenberg, i. 34, and iii. 165.
 rich drapings at its head,

All wrought of fragrant kusa grass, with deer-skin overspread.

And thus to Honour, heavenly nymph, the holy ascetic spake:

For your delight the couch is set; be pleased a seat to take.


79. The ascetic then pure water from the spring

In freshly gathered leaves with haste did bring,

And knowing what her inmost soul would crave

The ambrosial food to her he gladly gave.


80. As in her hands the welcome gift she pressed,

The nymph thus overjoyed the saint addressed:

Worship to me and victory you have given,

Lo! Now once more Iâll seek my native heaven.


81. The maid intoxicate with pride of fame,

With Kosiyaâs blessing, back to Sakka came,

And see, she cried, god of the thousand eyes,

The ambrosiaâs here â to me award the prize.


82. Then Sakka and his host of angels paid

Due honour to the peerless heavenly maid,

And as she sat on her new seat enthroned,

Her presence gods and men adoring owned.â
 {5.408}

83. âSo Sakka, lord of the Thirty-Three,

Once more addressing MÄtali,

Said, âGo and bid the saint explain

Why Honour should the ambrosia gain.â â

84. âSo MÄtali then launched a car to voyage through the air,

With fittings all to match itself, in splendour wondrous fair,

Its pole of gold, gold well refined, and all its framework built

With ornament elaborate and overlaid with gilt.


85. Peacocks in gold depicted were in numbers not a few,

Horses and cows and elephants, tigers and panthers too,

Here antelopes and deer are seen as if prepared for fight,

Here wrought in precious stones are jays and other birds in flight.


86. To it they yoked a thousand royal steeds of golden hue,

Each strong as youthful elephant, a splendid sight to view; 
{5.409}

Their breasts in golden network clad, with wreaths begarlanded,

With loosened trace, 
asaá¹gita,
 i.e. 
nissaá¹ga,
 perhaps the Greek ÏÎµÎ¹ÏÎ±Ïá½¹ÏÎ¿Ï [being led by the trace.].
 at a mere word, swift as the wind they sped.


87. As MÄtali this lordly car ascended with a bound

The firmament in all ten points re-echoed to the sound:

And as he journeyed through the air, he made the world to quake,

And sky and sea and earth with all its rocks and woods did shake.


88. Right soon he gained the hermitage and wishing to declare

Due reverence for the holy man he left one shoulder bare,

And speaking to this brahmin sage, a wise and learned man,

Well trained in holy lore, âtwas thus that MÄtali began:


89. âHear now, O Kosiya, the words of Sakka, heavenly king,

As to what he is fain to learn, this message, lo! I bring,

While Hope and Faith and Gloryâs claims you will not recognise,

Pray, why should Honour at your hands alone receive the prize?â â
 {5.410}

90. âGlory to me, O MÄtali, appears a partial jade,

While Faith, you charioteer of gods, proves an inconstant maid,

Hope ever a deceiver loves its promise to betray,

Honour alone is established firm in holy virtueâs way.â

91. âMaidens that still within their homes live, ever guarded well,

Women now past their prime, and such as still with husbands dwell,

In one and all should fleshly lust within their heart arise,

At Honourâs voice they check the thought and sinful passion dies.


92. Where shafts and spears in battleâs van are hurtling fast and free,

And in the rout when comrades fall or turn them round and flee,

At Honourâs voice they check their flight eâen at the cost of life,

And panic-stricken as they were once more renew the strife. 
The commentator would take it thus: âAnd rallying round their rescued lord once more renew the strife.â


93. Just as the shore will stem the rush of billows from the main,

So Honour too will oft the course of wicked folk restrain.

Then, MÄtali, to Sakka quick return and make it clear,

That saints throughout the whole wide world all Honourâs name revere.â 
[5.218] {5.411}

94. âWho was it, Kosiya, that did suggest this view to you,

Was it great Sakka, Brahma, or PajÄpati 
The same three gods occur in 
JÄtaka
 vi. 568. PajÄpati here is clearly distinct from Brahma.
 maybe?

This Honour, mighty sage, be sure, to Sakka owes her birth,

And in the Deva world she ranks foremost of all in worth.â

95. âCome now, O saint, and straightway mount the car so dear to me,

And let me lead you to the heaven where reign the Thirty-Three.

Sakka is longing sore for you, to Sakkaâs self akin,

Today your way to fellowship with Sakka you shall win.â

96. â âTis thus the acts of holy men to happy issue lead,

And evermore abides the fruit of meritorious deed. 
{5.412}

Whoso beheld the ambrosial food to Honour that was given,

Straight passed away to fellowship with Sakka, lord of heaven.â

The Teacher here ended his discourse with these words, âNot only now, monks, but of old also I converted this stingy fellow who was a confirmed miser,â and so saying he identified the JÄtaka thus, âAt that time Uppalavaá¹á¹Ä was the nymph Honour, a monk of lordly generosity was Kosiya, Anuruddha was PaÃ±casikha, Änanda was MÄtali, Kassapa was Suriya, MoggallÄna was Canda, SÄriputta was NÄrada, and I myself was Sakka.

## Analysis
In the present, after settling the war between the SÄkiyas and the Koliyas, they each give 250 young men for ordination. The young men quickly become dissatisfied with their lives, and long for their former wives. The Buddha takes them to the HimÄlayas, and there tells many stories about the wickedness of women, in order to calm their passions.

## Full Story
âThis is the report and the fame thereof.â
 
[5.219]
 This was a story told by the Teacher, while dwelling beside lake Kuá¹Äla, concerning five hundred monks who were overwhelmed with discontent. Here follows the story in due order. The SÄkiya and Koliya tribes had the river RohinÄ« which flows between the cities of Kapilavatthu and Koliya confined by a single dam and by means of it cultivated their crops. In the month Jeá¹­á¹­hamÅ«la [May-June] when the crops began to flag and droop, the labourers from amongst the dwellers of both cities assembled together. Then the people of Koliya said: âShould this water be drawn off on both sides, it will not prove sufficient for both us and you. But our crops will thrive with a single watering; give us then the water.â The people of Kapilavatthu said: âWhen you have filled your garners with corn, we shall hardly have the courage to come with ruddy gold, emeralds and copper coins, and with baskets and sacks in our hands, to hang about your doors. Our crops too will thrive with a single watering; give us the water.â âWe will not give it,â they said. âNeither will we,â said the others.


As words thus ran high, one of them rose up and struck another a blow, and he in turn struck a third and thus it was that what with interchanging of blows and spitefully touching on the origin of their princely families they increased the tumult. The Koliya labourers said: âBe off with your people of Kapilavatthu, 
{5.413}
 men who like dogs, jackals, and such like beasts, cohabited with their own sisters. What will their elephants and horses, their shields and spears avail against us?â The SÄkiya labourers replied, âNay, do you, wretched lepers, 
Compare Rogersâ translation of 
Buddhaghoshaâs Parables,
 Ch. xxvi., for an account of Gotamaâs family.
 be off with your children, destitute and ill-conditioned fellows, who like brute beasts had their dwelling in a hollow jujube tree (koli). What shall their elephants and horses, their spears and shields avail against us?â


So they went and told the councillors appointed to such services and they reported it to the princes of their tribes. Then the SÄkiyas said: âWe will show them how strong and mighty are the men who cohabited with their sisters,â and they sallied forth, ready for the fray. And the Koliyas said: âWe will show them how strong and mighty are they who dwelt in the hollow of a jujube tree,â and they too sallied forth ready for the fight.


But other teachers tell the story thus, âWhen the female slaves of the SÄkiyas and Koliyas came to the river to fetch water, and throwing the coils of cloth that they carried on their heads upon the ground were seated and pleasantly conversing, a certain woman took anotherâs cloth, thinking it was her own; and when owing to this a quarrel arose, each claiming the coil of cloth as hers, gradually the people of the two cities, the serfs and the labourers, the attendants, headmen, councillors and viceroys, all of them sallied forth ready for battle.â But the former version being found in many commentaries and being plausible is to be accepted rather than this one.


Now it was at eventide that they would be sallying forth, ready for the fray. At that time the Fortunate One was dwelling at SÄvatthi, and at dawn of day while contemplating the world he beheld them setting out to the fight, and on seeing them he wondered whether if he were to go there the quarrel would cease, and he made 
[5.220]
 up his mind and thought: âI will go there and, to quell this feud, I will relate three JÄtaka Stories, and after that the quarrelling will cease. Then after telling two JÄtaka Stories, to illustrate the blessings of union, I will teach them the Attadaá¹á¸asutta [Snp 4.15] and after hearing my sermon the people of the two cities will each of them bring into my presence two hundred and fifty youths, and I shall admit them to the Saá¹gha and there will be a huge gathering.â


Thus after performing his toilet, he went his rounds in SÄvatthi for alms, and on his return, after taking his meal, at eventide he issued forth from his Perfumed Chamber and without saying a word to any man he took his bowl and robe and went by himself and sat cross-legged in the air between the two hosts. And seeing it was an occasion to startle them, to create darkness he sat there emitting dark-blue 
JÄtaka
 i. p. 327, 
nÄ«laraá¹siá¹ vissajjetvÄ
.
 rays from his hair. Then when their hearts were troubled he revealed himself and emitted the six-coloured rays.


The people of Kapilavatthu on seeing the Fortunate One thought: âThe Teacher, our noble kinsman, is come. Can he have seen the obligation laid upon us to fight?â âNow that the Teacher has come, it is impossible for us to discharge a weapon against the person of an enemy,â 
{5.414}
 and they threw down their arms, saying: âLet the Koliyas slay us or roast us alive.â The Koliyas acted in exactly the same way. Then the Fortunate One alighted and seated himself on a magnificent Buddha throne, set in a charming spot on a bed of sand, and he shone with the incomparable glory of a Buddha. The kings too saluting the Fortunate One took their seats.


Then the Teacher, though he knew it right well, asked, âWhy are you come here, mighty kings?â âVenerable sir,â they answered, âwe are come, neither to see this river, nor to disport ourselves, but to get up a fight.â âWhat is the quarrel about, sires?â âAbout the water.â âWhat is the water worth?â âVery little, venerable sir.â âWhat is the earth worth?â âIt is of priceless value.â âWhat are warrior chiefs worth?â âThey too are of priceless value.â âWhy on account of some worthless water are you for destroying chiefs of high worth? Verily, there is no satisfaction in this quarrel, but owing to a feud, sir, between a certain Tree DevatÄ and a black lion a grudge was set up, which has reached down to this present aeon,â and with these words he told them the PhandanajÄtaka [Ja 475].

Then he said: âThere ought not to be this blind following 
parapatti,
 cf. 
JÄtaka
 iii. 77. 27.
 of one another. A host of quadrupeds in a region of the HimÄlayas, extending to three thousand leagues, following one another at the word of a hare, all rushed headlong into the great sea. Therefore this following one of another ought not to be,â and so saying he related the DaddabhajÄtaka [Ja 322].

Moreover he said: âSometimes the feeble see the weak points of the mighty, at other times the powerful see the weak points of the feeble, and a quail, a hen-bird, once killed a royal elephant,â and he related the LatukikajÄtaka [Ja 357].

Thus to appease the quarrel he told three JÄtaka Stories, and to illustrate the effects of unity he told two more JÄtaka Stories. âIn the case of such as dwell together in unity, no one finds any opening for attack,â and so saying he told the RukkhadhammajÄtaka [Ja 74].

He also said: âAgainst such as were at unity, no one could find a loophole for attack, but when they quarrelled one with another, a certain hunter brought about their destruction and went off with them: verily there is no satisfaction in a quarrel,â and with these words he related the Vaá¹­á¹­akajÄtaka [Ja 33]. 
[Another name for Ja 33 
SammodamÄnajÄtaka.
 I include the story here.]

After he had thus related these five JÄtaka Stories, he finished up by reciting the Attadaá¹á¸asutta [Snp 4.15]: 
[I include a translation here.]

Becoming believers the kings said: âHad not the Teacher come, we should have slain one another and set flowing rivers of blood. It is owing to the Teacher that we are alive. But if the Teacher had adopted the lay life, the realm of the four great island-continents, together with two thousand lesser islands, would have passed into 
[5.221]
 his hands and he would have had more than a thousand sons. Moreover he would have had an escort of warrior lords. But foregoing this glory he gave up the world 
{5.415}
 and attained to Supreme Awakening. Now too let him wander forth with a following of warrior lords.â So the two peoples each of them offered him two hundred and fifty princes.


The Fortunate One after ordaining them retired to a great forest. From the next day onward, escorted by them, he went his rounds for alms in the two cities, sometimes in Kapilavatthu, at other times in Koliya, and the people of both cities paid him great honour. Amongst these men, who were ordained not so much for their own pleasure as out of respect to the Teacher, spiritual discontent sprang up. And their former wives to stir up their discontent sent such and such messages to them, and they grew yet more dissatisfied. The Fortunate One on reflection discovered how discontented they were and thought: âThese monks, though living with a Buddha like me, are discontented. I wonder what kind of preaching would be profitable to them,â and he bethought him of the Kuá¹Äla Dhamma discourse. Then this notion struck him, âI will conduct these monks to the HimÄlayas and after illustrating the defilements connected with womankind by the Kuá¹Äla story and removing their discontent, I will bestow upon them the first stage of the paths.â


So in the morning putting on his under garment and taking his alms bowl and robes he went his rounds in Kapilavatthu, and having returned and taken his noonday meal, when the repast was finished, he addressed these five hundred monks and asked, âWas the delightful region of the HimÄlayas ever seen by you before?â They said: âNay, venerable sir.â âWill you go on pilgrimage to the HimÄlayas?â âVenerable sir, we have no Supernormal Powers; how should we go?â âBut supposing someone were to take you with him, would you go?â âYes, sire.â


The Teacher by his Supernormal Powers caught them all up with him in the air and transported them to the HimÄlayas and standing in the sky he pointed out to them in a pleasant tract of the HimÄlayas various mountains, Golden Mount, Jewel Mount, Vermilion Mount, Collyrium Mount, Table-land Mount, Crystal Mount, and five great rivers, and the lakes, Kaá¹á¹amuá¹á¸aka, RathakÄra, SÄ«happapÄta, Chaddanta, Tiyaggala, Anotatta and Kuá¹Äla, seven lakes in all.


The HimÄlayas is a vast region, five hundred leagues in height, three thousand leagues in breadth. This charming part of it by his mighty power did he show them, and the dwelling places that were built there, the quadrupeds too, troops of lions, tigers, elephants and so forth did he show from this place â sacred groves and other pleasances, flowering and fruit-bearing trees, flocks of all manner of birds, water and land plants â on the east side of the HimÄlayas a golden table land, on the west side a vermilion one.


From the first sight of these charming regions, the passionate longing of these monks for their former wives passed off. Then the Teacher with these monks 
{5.416}
 alighting from the air on the west side of the HimÄlayas on a rocky plateau sixty leagues in extent, in Red Valley three leagues long, beneath a SÄl tree covering seven leagues and lasting a whole aeon, the Teacher, I say, escorted by these monks, emitting the six-coloured rays and stirring up the depths of the ocean and blazing like the sun took his seat, and speaking with a voice sweet as honey he thus addressed these monks, âMonks, inquire of me about some marvel you have never seen before in this HimÄlayas.â


At that moment two spotted cuckoos, seizing a stick at both ends in their mouths, in the centre of it had placed their lord. Eight cuckoos in front and eight behind, eight on the right and eight on the left, eight below and eight above, thus casting a shadow over their lord as they escorted him, were flying through the air. These monks on seeing this flock of birds asked the Teacher, âWhat, sir, is the meaning of these birds?â âMonks,â he said, âthis is an ancient custom of our family, a tradition set up by me; in a former age they thus escorted me. Now at that time there was a vast gathering of these birds. Three thousand five hundred young hen-birds escorted me. Gradually wasting away the flock has become such as you see.â âIn what kind of forest did they escort you, sir?â Then the Teacher said: âWell, hearken, monks,â and recalling it to mind he told a story of the past and thus taught them.
 [5.222]

1. âIn ancient story Kaá¹hÄ, it is said,

A single maid to princes five was wed,

Insatiate still she lusted for yet more

And with a humpbacked dwarf she played the whore.â

1a. This too was known to me, how the mother

 of Brahmadatta, forsaking the king of Kosala,

1b. Did wrong with PaÃ±cÄlacaá¹á¸a. These and other women went wrong, and one should not put trust in women nor praise them.

1c. As the earth is impartially affected towards all the world, bearing wealth for all, a home for all sorts and conditions of men (good and bad alike), all-enduring, unshaken, immovable, so also is it with women (in a bad sense). A man should not trust them.


2. âAs lion fed upon raw flesh and blood,

With his five 
The lionâs mouth is the fifth paw.
 paws fierce ravening for food,

In othersâ hurt will his chief pleasure find â

Such like are women. Man, beware their kind.â

3. âLike poisoned draught or robber fell, crooked as horn of stag,

Like serpent evil-tongued 
One MS. for 
dujjivha
 reads 
dujivha
 âdouble-tongued.â
 are they, as merchant apt to brag,


4. Murderous as covered pit, like hellâs insatiate maw are they,

As Yakkha greedy or like Death that carries all away.


5. Devouring like a flame are they, mighty as wind or flood,

Like Neruâs golden peak that aye confuses 
NÄvasamÄkatÄ
 can scarcely be right. The commentary gives as the epithet to Neru 
nibbisesakÄrÄ.
 One reading gives 
nÄvasamÄgatÄ,

 bad and good,

Pernicious as a poison tree they fivefold ruin bring

On household gear, wasters of wealth and every precious thing.â

6. âOx, cow, nor car to neighbours lend,

Nor trust a wife to house of friend:

The car they break through want of skill,

The ox by over-driving kill.


7. The cow is over-milked before long,

The wife in kinsmanâs house goes wrong.â

8. âIf poor or sick or old, a sot, or reckless thought,

If dull or by his cares of business overwrought,

Or disobliging found â such lord a wife esteems as nought.â

9. âA woman dressed in smart cloth vest, dram-drinking, apt to roam

In pleasance, park, by river side, to friendâs or strangerâs home,


10. Standing before her door, to stare about with idle gaze,

In nine such ways corrupted soon from path of virtue strays.â

11. âHer husbandâs absence she approves nor grieves should he depart,

Nor at the sight of his return rejoices in her heart,

She neâer at any time will say aught in her husbandâs praise,

Such are the signs that surely mark the wicked womanâs ways.


12. Undisciplined, against her lord some mischief she will plot,

His interest neglects and does the thing that she ought not,

With face averted lies she down beside him, fully dressed,

By such like signs her wickedness is surely thus confessed.
 {5.435}


13. Restless she turns from side to side nor lies one moment still, 
kuá¹kumÄ«
,

kolÄhalaá¹ karoti
.

Or heaves a long drawn sigh and groans, pretending she is ill,

As if at natureâs call from bed she oftentimes will rise,

By such like signs her wickedness a man may recognise.


14. Perverse in all her acts she does the thing she should eschew,

And hearkens to the strangerâs voice, her favours should he sue,

Her husbandâs wealth is freely spent some other love to gain,

By signs like these her wickedness to all is rendered plain.


15. The wealth that by her lord with toil was carefully amassed,

The gear so painfully heaped up, behold, she squanders fast,

With neighbours far too intimate the lady soon will grow,

And by such signs the wickedness of women one may know.


16. Stepping abroad behold her how she walks about the streets,

And with the grossest disrespect her lord and master treats:

Nor of adultery stops short, corrupt in heart and mind â

By such like signs how wicked are all womenfolk we find.


17. Often she will at her own door all decency defy,

And shamelessly expose herself to any passing by,
 [5.234]

The while with troubled heart she looks around on every side â

By such like signs the wickedness of women is descried.


18. As groves are made of wood, as streams in curves and windings flow,

So, give them opportunity, all women wrong will go.


19. Yea give them opportunity and secrecy withal,

And every single woman will from paths of virtue fall:

Thus will all women wantons prove, should time and place avail,

And eâen with humpback dwarf does wrong, should other lovers fail.


20. Women that serve for manâs delight let every one distrust,

Fickle in heart they ever are and unrestrained in lust.

Ladies of pleasure fitly called, the basest of the base,

To all then such as common are as any bathing place.â
 {5.437}

21. âThis much from tale of Kaá¹á¸ari and KinnarÄ is shown;

All women fail to find delight in homes that are their own.

Thus does a wife forsake her lord, though lusty he and strong,

And will with any other man, eâen misshapen, go wrong.â

22. âWife of PÄvÄrika and Baka too,

(Two kings whose lust no pause or limit knew)

Yet does wrong with devoted husbandâs slave;

With what vile wretch would she not misbehave?â

23. âFair Piá¹giyÄnÄ« was as wife adored

By Brahmadatta, earthâs all conquering lord,

Yet did wrong with devoted husbandâs slave,

And lost by lechery both king and cheat.â 
{5.445}

24. âPoor fickle creatures women are, ungrateful, treacherous they,

No man if not possessed would deign to credit aught they say.


25. Little reck they of dutyâs call or plea of gratitude,

Insensible to parentsâ love and ties of brotherhood,

Transgressing every law of right, they play a shameless part,

In all their acts obedient to the wish of their own heart.
 [5.241]


26. However long they dwell with him, though kind and loving he,

Tender of heart and dear to them as life itself may be,

In times of trouble and distress, leave him they will and must,

I for my part in womenfolk can never put my trust.


27. How often is a womanâs mind like shifty monkeyâs found,

Or like the shade cast by a tree on height 
kanna,
 apparently Skt 
skanna,
 but one would have expected the compound to be 
pakkanna.

Gramm. der PrÄkrit-Sprachen,

 or depth around,

How changeful too the purpose lodged within a womanâs breast,

Like tire of wheel revolving swift without a pause or rest.


28. Wheneâer with due reflection they look round and see their way

To captivate some man of wealth and make of him their prey,

Such simpletons with words so soft and smooth they captive lead,

Eâen as Cambodian groom with herbs will catch the fiercest steed.


29. But if when looking round with care they fail to see their way

To get possession of his wealth and make of him a prey,

They drive him off, as one that now has reached the furthest shore

And cuts adrift the ferry boat he needeth nevermore.


30. Like fierce devouring flame they hold him fast in their embrace,

Or sweep him off like stream in flood that hurries on apace;

They court the man they hate as much as one that they adore,

Eâen as a ship that hugs alike the near and farther shore.


31. They not to one or two belong, like open stall are they,

One might as soon catch wind with net as women hold in sway.

32. Like river, road, or drinking shed,

So free to all are womenfolk, no limits check their sin.


33. Fell as black serpentâs head are they, as ravenous as a fire,

As kine the choicest herbage pick, they lovers rich desire.


34. From elephant, black serpent, and from flame thatâs fed on ghee,

From man besprinkled to be king, and women we should flee.

All these whoso is on his guard will treat as deadly foe,

Indeed their very nature it is very hard to know.


35. Women who very clever are or very fair to view,

And such as many men admire â all these one should eschew:

A neighbourâs wife and one that seeks a man of wealth for mate,

Such kind of women, five in all, no man should cultivate.â
 {5.447}

36. âAlthough a man with all this world contains of golden gear

Should her endow of womankind his heart may count most dear,

Yet, if occasion serves, she will dishonour him withal â

Beware lest you into the hands of such vile wretches fall.

 he may show, from worldly taint be free,

Her maiden wooer may perhaps winsome and loving be,

In times of trouble and distress leave him she will and must,

I for my part in womankind can never put my trust.


38. Let him not trust because he thinks she fancies me, I know,

Nor let him trust because her tears oft in his presence flow;

They court the man they hate as much as one that they adore,

Just as a ship that hugs alike the near and farther shore.


39. Trust not a litter strewn with leaves and branches long ago, 
For fear it may harbour a snake.

Trust not your whilom friend, perchance now grown into a foe,

Trust not a king because you think, âMy comrade once was he,â

Trust not a woman though she has borne children ten to thee.


40. Women are pleasure-seekers all and unrestrained in lust,

Transgressors of the moral law: in such put not your trust.

A wife may feign unbounded love before her husbandâs face;

Distrust her: women common are as any landing place.


41. Ready to mutilate or slay, from nothing do they shrink,

And after having cut his throat they eâen his blood would drink:

Let no man fix his love on them, creatures of passions base,

Licentious and as common as some Ganges landing place.


42. In speech they no distinction make betwixt the false and true,

As kine the choicest herbage pick, rich lovers they pursue.


43. One man they tempt with looks and smiles, another by their walk,

Some they attract by strange disguise, 
The commentator refers to the story of Ja 526 
Naá¸·inikÄ,
 as an instance of this.
 others by honeyed talk.


44. Dishonest, fierce and hard of heart, as sugar sweet their words,

Nothing there is they do not know to cheat their wedded lords.


45. Surely all womenfolk are vile, no limit bounds their shame,

Impassioned and audacious they, devouring as a flame.


46. Women are not so formed, this man to love and that abhor,

They court the man they hate as much as one that they adore,

Eâen as a ship that hugs alike the near and farther shore.
 {5.449}


47. âTis not a case of love or hate with womenfolk we see,

It is for gold they hug a man, as parasites a tree.


48. A man may corpses burn or eâen dead flowers from temples rake, 
pupphachaá¸á¸aka,
 a low-caste man who removes dead flowers from temples, Thag v. 620, 
Questions of Milinda,

Be groom of horse or elephant, or care of oxen take,

Yet women after such low castes will run for moneyâs sake.


49. One nobly born they leave if poor, as âtwere a low outcaste,

To such a one, like carrion vile, if rich, they hie them fast.â
 {5.450}

50. âFour things can never sated be â list well to these my words â

Ocean, kings, brahmins, womankind, these four, O king of birds.


51. All streams in earth that find their home will not the ocean fill,

Though all may with its waters mix, something is lacking still.

Yet still he sacred knowledge lacks and craves for more and more.


53. A king by conquest holds the world, its mountains, seas and all,

The endless treasures it contains his very own may call,

Yet sighs for worlds beyond the sea, for this he counts too small.


54. One woman may have husbands eight, compliant to her will,

All heroes bold, well competent loveâs duties to fulfil,

Yet on a ninth her love she sets, for something lacks she still.


55. Women like flames devour their prey,

Women like floods sweep all away,

Women are pests, like thorns are they,

Women for gold oft go astray.


56. That man with net might catch the breeze,

Or single-handed bale out seas,

Clap with one hand, who once should dare

His thoughts let range on woman fair.


57. With women, clever jades, truth aye is found a rarity,

Their ways as much perplex as those of fishes in the sea. 
These lines occur on p. 52, 
supra.
 {5.451}


58. Soft-speaking, ill to satisfy, as rivers hard to fill,

Down â down they sink: who women know should flee far from them still. 
Vol. ii. p. 226, vol. iv. p. 292, English version.


59. Seducing traitresses, they tempt the holiest to his fall,

Down â down they sink: who women know should flee afar from all.


60. And whomsoever they may serve for gold or for desire,

They burn him up as fuel burns cast in a blazing fire.â

61. âEâen a wise man may dare to exchange a word

With Yakkha foe armed with sharp whetted sword,

Fierce snake he may assail, but neâer too bold

Alone with woman should he converse hold. 
[5.244]


62. Manâs reason is oâercome by womanâs charms,

Speech, smiles, with dance and song, their only arms:

Unstable souls they harass, as erewhile

Fell Yakkhas merchants slew in Yakkha isle.


63. Given to strong drink and meat, one tries in vain

To curb their appetite or lust restrain,

Like to some fabled monster of the deep,

Into their maw a manâs whole wealth they sweep.


64. Lustâs five-fold realm they own as their domain,

Their swelling pride uncurbed none may restrain:

As rivers all to ocean find their way,

So careless souls to women fall a prey.


65. The man in whom these women take delight,

Moved by their greed or carnal appetite,

Yea such a one inflamed by strong desire,

They clean consume as fuel in the fire.


66. If one they know is rich, on him they fall

And off they carry him, his wealth and all,

Round him thus fired with lust their arms they fling,

As creepers to some forest SÄl tree cling.

Scourged, cudgelled, buffeted or kicked about,

Yet woman to some low-born lover hies

Nor upon earth the world-wide monarchâs sway,

Who with sensual desire long since have done.


78. To pass from Realm of Sense with life renewed

To World of Form, with higher powers endued,

Unwavering, unconditioned, without end,

Is by pure souls, now in NibbÄna, won

Who with sensual desire long since have done.â

The Teacher here ended his lesson and identifying the JÄtaka repeated the final verse:




80. âUdÄyi royal cuckoo was, Änanda vulture king,

Good SÄriputta NÄrada, Kuá¹Äla I that sing.â






Thus are you to understand this JÄtaka.


Now these monks, when they came, came by the supernatural power of the Teacher, and on returning returned by their own power. And the Teacher revealed to them in the Great Forest the means by which Absorption may be induced, and that very day they attained to Arahatship. There was a mighty gathering of Devas, so the Fortunate One declared to them the MahÄsamayasutta [DN 20].

## Full Story
âTeacher of dainty flavours.â
 
[5.246]
 This story the Teacher while dwelling at Jetavana told concerning the elder Aá¹gulimÄla. 
For the story of Aá¹gulimÄla see 
Aá¹gulimÄlasuttaá¹ (
MN 
,
 No. 86, vol. ii. pt. i. p. 97).
 The manner of his birth and admission to the Saá¹gha is to be understood as fully described in the Aá¹gulimÄlasutta [MN 86]. Now from the time when by an Assertion of Truth he saved the life of a woman having a difficult delivery he easily obtained offerings of food and by cultivating retirement he afterwards attained to Arahatship and became recognised as one of the eighty great elders.


At that time they started this subject in the Dhamma Hall, saying: âOh! What a miracle, sirs, was wrought by the Fortunate One in that he thus peacefully and without using any violence converted and humbled such a cruel and blood-stained robber as Aá¹gulimÄla: Oh! Buddhas verily do mighty works!â The Teacher seated in the Perfumed Chamber by his divine sense of hearing caught what was said and, knowing that today his coming would be very helpful and that there would be an exposition of a great Dhamma, with the incomparable grace of a Buddha he went to the Dhamma Hall and there sitting on the seat reserved for him he asked what theme they were discussing in the meeting; and when they told him what it was he said: âThere is no marvel, monks, in my converting him now, 
{5.457}

 knowledge,â and with these words he told a story of the past.

1. âTeacher of dainty flavours, what dire need

Has urged you on to do this dreadful deed?

Have you for food to eat or wealth to gain,

Misguided wretch, these men and women slain?â

2. âNeither for wife or child, friends, kin or pelf,

Nor did I slay this woman for myself;

My gracious lord, the sovereign of this land,

Eats human flesh: I did wrong at his command.â


3. âIf thus instigated to sate your masterâs greed

You have been guilty of this awful deed, 
{5.461}

Let us at early dawn seek out the king

And in his face the accusation fling.â


4. âO KÄá¸·ahatthi, worshipful good lord,

So will I do according to your word,

At early dawn will I seek out the king

And in his face this accusation fling.â

5. â âTwas now sunrise and day had scarce begun to break,

As KÄá¸·a to the court with cook his way did take,

And drawing nigh the king words such as these he spake:


6. âSire, is it true this cook was sent into the street,

And men and women slew to furnish you with meat?â
 {5.462}


7. âKÄá¸·a, âtis even so; âtwas done at my request:

Why blame him then for what he did at my behest?â â

8. âÄnanda ate of every fish and when his suite had fled,

He his own tail right greedily devoured till he was dead.


9. The slave to appetite no other pleasure knows,

Poor careless fool, so blind is he to coming woes:

He children, kith and kin in ruin low will lay,

Then turns and rends himself, to monstrous greed a prey.


10. To these my words, O king, I pray you, hearken well,

Eat not the flesh of men; forego your purpose fell:

Lest you perchance should share that fishâs awful fate

And leave, O lord of men, your kingdom desolate.â
 {5.465}

11. âSujÄtaâs son and heir for some Jambu plums loudly cried,

For loss of them the lad so grieved, he laid him down and died.


12. So, KÄá¸·a, I who now long time have fed on daintiest fare,

Failing this human flesh, I think, for life would cease to care.â

13. âA scion of a brahmin house, withal a comely boy,

14. âSince, father, from this best of tastes you fain would me debar,

To get it, where it may be found Iâll go however far.


15. Depart will I in haste and neâer dwell with you any more,

For now the very sight of me, I think, you do abhor.â

16. âSurely some other sons weâll find as heirs our wealth to claim,

Go, rascal, where we never more may hear your cursÃ¨d name.â

17. âSo hearken well, O king of men, obeying my command,

Or like that drunken youth will you be banished from the land.â

 SujÄta, it is said,

Abstained from food and drink through love felt for a heavenly maid.


19. As dewdrop on a blade of grass to waters of the sea,

Is human love compared with love for some divinity.


20. So, KÄá¸·a, I who now long time have fed on daintiest fare,

Failing this human flesh, I think, for life would cease to care.â

21. âJust as these Dhataraá¹­tha geese that travel through the air

All died because they lived upon a most unnatural fare,


22. So too do you, O king of men, list well to what I say,

For eating this unlawful food, you too theyâll drive away.â

23. âAlthough I bid you stand, you still do forward fly,

And crying âLo! I stand,â I think you do but lie:

Unseemly âtis; this sword, O monk, you must assume

To be a harmless shaft equipped with heronâs plume.â 
A heronâs feather was fixed on an arrow.

24. âSteadfast in righteousness am I,

Nor change my name or family,

Here robbers but brief moment dwell,

Soon doomed to pass to woes of hell.


25. Be bold and captive here great Sutasoma bring,

And by his sacrifice shall you heaven win, O king.â

26. âBorn in what realm and why, I pray,

Do hither come, O brahmin, say; 
{5.477}

This said, today I grant to you

Your prayer, whatever it may be.â

27. âFour verses, mighty king, to you

Of import deep as is the sea

I hither bring; list to them well,

Secrets of highest worth they tell.â

28. âMen versed in lore, in whom high thoughts arise,

Such never weep, the learned and the wise;

All find herein a refuge and a stay,

That sages thus can sorrow drive away.


29. Is it your kin, wife, child, perchance thyself,

Your stores of grain, your gold and silver pelf â 
{5.479}

What, Sutasoma, caused your tears to flow?

Great Kuru lord, your answer we would know.â

30. âNay, I no tears am shedding for myself,

Nor for my wife or child, my realm or pelf.

The practice of the saints of old I keep,

And for a promise unfulfilled I weep.


31. Once to a brahmin I my word did plight,

What time in mine own realm I ruled with might;

That plighted word I fain would keep and then,

My honour saved, return to you again.â

32. âIâll not believe if any one should be

By happy chance from jaws of death set free,

He would return to yield him to his foe;

No more would you, if I should let you go. 
{5.480}


33. Escaped from fierce man-eater should you come,

Full of sweet longings, to your royal home,

Dear life with all its charms restored to you,

Why in the world should you come back to me?â 
[5.262]

34. âIf innocent, a man would death prefer

To life oâerclouded with some odious slur;

Should he, to save his life, a falsehood tell,

It may not shield him from the woes of hell.

Or sun and moon to earth fall from the sky,

Yea, rivers all up stream may flow, my lord,

Ere I be guilty of one lying word.â

36. âLo! As I touch this spear and sword

To you I pledge my solemn word,

Release me and I will debt-free,

My honour saved, return to thee.â

37. âThe word you once did to a brahmin plight,

What time in thine own realm you ruled with might,

That plighted word I bid you keep and then,

Your honour saved, return to me again.â

38. âThe word I once did to a brahmin plight,

What time in mine own realm I ruled with might,

That plighted word I first will keep and then,

My honour saved, return to you again.â

39. âReleased from fierce man-eaterâs hand he flies

To brahmin friend and âFain would we,â he cries, 
{5.483}

âHear verses worth a hundred pieces each,

Us for our good if you would deign to teach.â â

40. âIn union with the saints just once, O Sutasoma, be,

And neâer consort with evil men and peace shall compass you.


41. With holy men consorting aye, as friends such only know,

From holy men true Dhamma learn and daily better grow.


42. As painted cars of royalty wax dim and fade away,

So too our bodies frail wear out and suffer swift decay.

But Dhamma of holy men abides and never waxes old,

Good men proclaim it to the good through ages yet untold.


43. The sky above us stretches far, far stretches earth below,

And lands beyond the boundless sea far distant are we know,

But greater still than all of these and wider in its reach

Is Dhamma whether good or bad that saints or sinners preach.â
 {5.484}

44. âNot hundreds merely are they worth, nay thousands rather say,

So brahmin here four thousand take and, quick, with them away.â

45. âVerses may be worth eighty pieces each,

Or eâen a hundred may in value reach,

But, Sutasoma, you thyself must own

A verse worth a thousand is unknown.â

46. âIncrease in holy lore I most desire

And to the friendship of the saints aspire;

No rivers can the void of ocean fill,

So I good words imbibe, insatiate still.


47. As flames for wood and grass insatiate roar,

And seas aye fed with streams crave more and more,

Eâen so do sages, mighty lord of lords,

Insatiate hearken to well-spoken words.


48. If from the mouth of my own slave I eâer

Should verses full of deepest import hear, 
{5.486}

His words I would accept with honour due,

Unsated still with doctrines good and true.â

49. âThis realm is thine with all its wealth of gold,

Trappings of state and joy and bliss untold.

Why blame, should I from sensual pleasures fly

And at man-eaterâs hand go forth to die?â

50. âFor our defence lo! valiant soldiers come,

Some riding elephants, on chariots some,

Foot-soldiers these, these horsemen armed with bow â

Marshal our host and let us slay our foe.â 
[5.266]

51. âWondrous this deed of our man-eating foe,

To capture me alive and let me go.

Calling to mind his friendly acts of yore

How can I violate the oath I swore?â

52. âFarewell to parents said, with counsel wise

Townsmen and soldiers he did straight advise,

Then true to plighted word refused to lie,

And to man-eater back again did hie.â

53. âMy word I once did to a brahmin plight,

What time in mine own realm I ruled with might,

And now that I have kept my plighted word

And saved my honour, have returned, my lord.

So slay and offer me to your sprite

Or for manâs flesh sate your fell appetite.â 
[5.267]

54. âThe fire still smokes: though I somewhat delay,

I forfeit not the right to eat my prey.

Meat roast oâer embers clear is roasted well;

These strains a hundred pieces worth, come, tell.â 
{5.489}

55. âYou, O man-eater, are a wicked wight,

Fallân from your throne through carnal appetite;

These verses do proclaim Dhamma to me,

But how can Dhamma and Adhamma agree?


56. To wicked robber, one whose hands are steeped in gore,

Whence comes Truth or Dhamma? What profits holy lore?â

57. âThe man that hunts a beast to make him savoury meat,

And one that slays a man, his fellowâs flesh to eat,

Both after death in guilt are counted much the same:

Then why am I alone for wickedness to blame?â

58. âOf five-clawed things a warrior prince all witting five may eat, 
[Hares, porcupines, iguana, hedgehogs, turtle.]

Wicked are you, O king, in that you eat forbidden meat.â 
{5.490}

59. âEscaped from fierce man-eater did you come

Full of sweet longings to your royal home,

And then to foe entrust your life once more?

Well versed are you, forsooth, in astral lore!â

60. âAll such as are in noble Dhamma 
See

Ká¹£atriyadhamma
 it is maintained that a man is justified in doing evil to serve his own interests.

In hell are mostly doomed to life accursed.

Therefore I have all noble lore abhorred

And here returned, true to my plighted word:

Make then your sacrifice and eat me up, dread lord.â

61. âPalatial halls, broad acres, steeds and kine,

Perfumes, rich robes and many a concubine,

All these as mighty lord you hold in fee â

In truth what blessing, pray you, do you see?â 
{5.491}

62. âOf all the sweets this world can yield to me

None sweeter than the joys of truth I see:

The brahmins and monks that in truth abide,

Birth, death, escaping, reach the further side.â

63. âEscaped from fierce man-eater did you come

Full of sweet longings to your royal home,

And then once more return to meet your foe?

You, surely, prince, no fear of death can know,

To keep your plighted word and worldly sensual desires forego.â

64. âAs mine I countless acts of virtue claim,

My bounteous offerings are known to fame,

To the next world a path I have kept clear:

Who abides in Dhamma holds death in fear?


65. As mine I countless acts of virtue claim,

My bounteous offerings are known to fame, 
{5.492}

With no regrets to heaven Iâll take my way,

So sacrifice and then devour your prey.


66. My parents have I cherished with fond care,

My rule wins praise as eminently fair,

To the next world a path I have kept clear:

Who abides in Dhamma holds death in fear?


67. My parents have I cherished with fond care,

My rule wins praise as eminently fair,

With no regrets to heaven Iâll take my way,

So sacrifice and then devour your prey.
 [5.269]


68. To friends and kin due service I have done,

My rule was just and praise from all has won,

With no regrets to heaven Iâll take my way,

So sacrifice and then devour your prey.


69. Gifts manifold to many I supplied,

Yea, monks and brahmins fully satisfied,

To the next world a path I have kept clear:

Who abides in Dhamma holds death in fear?


70. Gifts manifold to many I supplied,

Yea monks and brahmins fully satisfied,

With no regrets to heaven Iâll take my way,

So sacrifice and then devour your prey.â
 {5.493}

71. âHe knowingly would quaff a poison cup

Or fiery snake, so fell and fierce, take up,

Yea into fragments seven his head would fly

That dares to eat a man that cannot lie.â

72. âHearing the truth men soon discern betwixt the good and ill;

Perchance if heard these strains my heart with joy in truth may fill.â

74. âIn union with the saints just once, O Sutasoma, be,
 
[5.270]

And neâer consort with evil men and peace shall compass you.


75. With holy men consorting aye, as friends such only know,

From holy men true Dhamma learn and daily better grow.

So too our bodies frail wear out and suffer swift decay.

But Dhamma of holy men abides and never waxes old,

Good men proclaim it to the good through ages yet untold.

And lands beyond the boundless sea far distant are we know,

But greater still than all of these and wider in its reach

Is Dhamma whether good or bad that saints or sinners preach.â

78. âPregnant with meaning and in accents clear

Your goodly words, O prince, fall on mine ear,

So glad am I at heart, that I rejoice

Four boons, good friend, to offer you for choice.â

79. âOne his own mortal state that fails to learn,

Or good from evil, heaven from hell discern,

The slave of carnal appetite, how can

A wretch like you know any boon for man?


80. Suppose I say âGrant me this boonâ and then

You should your promised word take back again,

Who that is wise would knowingly incur

So clear a risk of quarrelling, good sir?â

81. âNo one should claim to grant a boon and then

His promised word, false man, take back again:

Amongst these boons, my friend, all fearless choose;

Iâll grant it you, though life itself I lose.â

83. âWho with a saint lives face to face ever with saint agrees,

So too a sage is ever sure a brother sage to please:

You fain would see me safe and sound for years twice fifty live:

Lo! At your prayer this first of boons to you I gladly give.â

84. âThese warrior chiefs held captive in your hand,

By sprinkling hailed as kings in many a land,

These mighty lords of earth you must not eat:

For this as second boon I next entreat.â

85. âThese warrior chiefs held captive in my hand,

By sprinkling hailed as kings in many a land,

These mighty lords, Iâll not eat them, I swear:

This second boon too grant I to your prayer.â

86. âYou captive hold a hundred kings and more,

All strung up by their hands and weeping sore,

Restore then each to his own realm again:

This the third boon I would from you obtain.â

87. âI captive hold a hundred kings and more,

All strung up by their hands and weeping sore,

All will I to their realms restore again:

This third boon too you shall from me obtain.â

88. âDistracted is your realm and sick with fright,

In caves much people hide them from your sight.

From eating human flesh, O king, abstain:

This the fourth boon I would from you obtain.â 
[5.272] {5.498}

89. âMuch to my taste I surely find this food;

âTwas for this cause I hid within the wood.

How then from such delights should I abstain?

For your fourth boon, good sir, pray, choose again.â

And future joys you shall by merit gain.â

91. âI love manâs flesh: you too must know,

Great Sutasoma, it is so.

From it I never can abstain,

92. âWhoso shall ever his own pleasure take

And sacrifice eâen life for pleasureâs sake,

The poison cup like drunkard will he drain,

And so hereafter suffers endless pain.

108. âOf beasts and birds of every kind the flesh you once did share,

With many a woollen coverlet around you piled on high,

And pillow red beneath your head and bedding clean and white â

Why leave it thus, within this wood alone to take delight


111. There you oft times at dead of night the beat of drum would hear,

And sounds surpassing human strains 
nippurisa.

Music and song in unison, inspiring cheerful mood â

Why leave it all, to take delight alone within this wood?


112. You had a charming park wherein flowers in abundance grew,

MigÄcira, so known to fame, as park and city too,

There horses, elephants, and cars innumerable stood â

Why leave them all, to take delight alone within this wood?â
 {5.507}

113. âAs in the dark half of the month the moon wanes day by day,

So friendship with the bad, O king, will suffer like decay;


114. Thus I consorting with that cook, the lowest of the low,

Wrought evil deeds, for which in time to hell Iâm doomed to go.


115. As in the monthâs clear half the moon aye waxes day by day,

So friendship with the good, O king, will suffer no decay:


116. Thus with you, Sutasoma, I consorting, you must know,

Shall after working righteousness to heaven all blissful go.


117. As copious floods when shed upon dry ground

Are ever fleeting, transitory found,

Like water on dry land, a fleeting thing.


118. But copious floods when shed upon the sea

Enduring long are ever found to be,

Eâen such is union of good men, O king,

Like water in the sea, a lasting thing.

As long as life endures such brotherhood,

But union of the bad soon falls away,

From virtueâs course bad men go far astray.â

No friend should get the better of a friend by treachery;

She of her lord that stands in fear is no true wife, I hold,

Nor children they that nourish not a father when heâs old.


121. No council-hall is that wherein the wise do not appear,

Nor wise are they that do not preach the Dhamma far and near.

The wise are they that lust and hate and error lay aside,

And never fail to preach Dhamma to mortals far and wide.


122. The sage midst fools if silent none at once discern as wise,

He speaks and all a teacher of the deathless recognise.


123. Preach, glorify the Dhamma, and lift the sagesâ flag on high,

Emblem of saints is goodly speech, Dhamma the flag they fly.â
 {5.510}

The Teacher here ended his Dhamma instruction and said: âNot only now, monks, do I convert Aá¹gulimÄla, in former times too was he converted by me, and he identified the JÄtaka: at that time the man-eating king was Aá¹gulimÄla, KÄá¸·ahatthi was SÄriputta, the brahmin Nanda was Änanda, the Tree DevatÄ was Kassapa, Sakka was Anuruddha, the rest of the kings were the followers of Buddha, the kingâs father and mother were members of the great kingâs household, and king Sutasoma, it is said, was I myself.â

In the present the monks are discussing the Great Renunciation. The Buddha tells a story of how a prince understood at an early age that the justice he must meet out as king would lead him to hell, as it had in a previous life, and from that moment on he played dumb. Later when he was taken out to be killed, he explained his dumbness to his would be killers, and converted them.

âShow no intelligence.â
 
[6.1] {6.1}
 This story the Teacher told at Jetavana concerning the Great Renunciation.


One day the monks seated in the Dhamma Hall were discussing the praises of the Fortunate Oneâs Great Renunciation. When the Teacher came and inquired of the monks what was the topic which they were discussing as they sat there, on hearing what it was, he said: âNo, monks, this my renunciation of the world, after leaving my kingdom, was not wonderful, when I had fully exercised the Perfections; for before, even when my wisdom was still immature, and while I was still attaining the Perfections, I left my kingdom and renounced the world.â And at their request he told them a story.

1. âShow no intelligence, my child, be as a fool in all menâs eyes,

Content to be the scorn of all, thus shall you gain at last the prize.â

2. âDevatÄ, I will do your will â what you command me is the best,

Mother, you wishest for my weal, you longest but to see me blessed,â

3. âWhy in such haste, O charioteer? And wherefore do you dig that pit?

Answer my question truthfully â what do you want to do with it?â

4. âOur king found his son handicapped and dumb â an idiot quite;

And I am sent to dig this hole and bury him far out of sight.â

5. âI am not deaf nor dumb, my friend, not handicapped or lame am I;

If in this wood you bury me, you will incur great guilt thereby. 
{6.13}


6. Behold these arms and legs of mine, and hear my voice and what I say;

If in this wood you bury me, you will incur great guilt today.â

7. âA heavenly minstrel or a god, or are you Sakka, lord of all?

Who are you, pray; whose son are you? What shall we name you when we call?â 
[6.10]

8. âNo Gandhabba nor a Deva, nor Sakka, lord of all, am I; 
Petavatthu
, p. 24.

I am the king of KÄsiâs son whom you would bury ruthlessly.


9. I am the son of that same king under whose sway you serve and thrive,

You will incur great guilt today if here you bury me alive.


10. If âneath a tree I sit and rest while it its shade and shelter lends, 
JÄtaka
 v. 340 (p. 180 of the translation), 
Petavatthu
, p. 23.

I would not break a single branch â only the sinner harms his friends.


11. The sheltering tree â it is the king â I am the branch that tree has spread;

And you the traveller, charioteer, who sits and rests beneath its shade;

If in this wood you bury me, great guilt will fall upon your head.â
 {6.14}

12. âHe who is faithful to his friends may wander far and wide â

Many will gladly wait on him, his food shall be supplied.


13. Whatever lands he wanders through, in city or in town,

He who is faithful to his friends finds honour and renown.


14. No robbers dare to injure him, no warriors him despise;

He who is faithful to his friends escapes all enemies.


15. Welcomed by all he home returns â no cares corrode his breast,

He who is faithful to his friends is of all kin the best.


16. He honours and is honoured too â respect he takes and gives;

He who is faithful to his friends full meed from all receives.


17. He is by others honoured who to them due honour pays,

He who is faithful to his friends wins himself fame and praise.


18. Like fire he blazes brightly forth, and sheds a light divine,

He who is faithful to his friends will with fresh splendour shine.


19. His oxen surely multiply, his seed unfailing grows,

He who is faithful to his friends reaps surely all he sows.


20. If from a mountain-top he falls or from a tree or grot,

He who is faithful to his friends finds a sure resting spot.


21. The banyan tree defies the wind, girt with its branches rooted round â

He who is faithful to his friends does all the rage of foes confound.â
 {6.15}

22. âCome, I will take you back, O prince, to thine own proper home;

Sit on the throne and act the king â why in this forest roam?â 
[6.11]

23. âI do not want that throne or wealth, I want not friends nor kin,

Since âtis by evil acts alone that I that throne could win.â

24. âA brimful cup of welcome, prince, will be prepared for you;

And your two parents in their joy great gifts will give to me.


25. The royal wives, the princes all, merchants and brahmins both,

Great presents in their full content will give me, nothing loth.


26. Those who ride elephants and cars, foot-soldiers, royal guards,

When you returnest home again, will give me sure rewards.


27. The country folk and city folk will gather joyously,

And when they see their prince returned will presents give to me.â
 {6.16}

28. âBy parents I was left forlorn, by city and by town,

The princes left me to my fate â I have no home my own.


29. My mother gave me leave to go, my father me forsook â

Here in this forest wild alone the asceticâs vow I took.â

30. âEven to those who hurry not, thâ heartâs longing wins success;

Know, charioteer, that I today have gained ripe holiness. 
See Vol. i. p. 30.


31. Even by those who hurry not, the highest end is won;

Crowned with ripe holiness I go, perfect and fearing none.â

32. âYour words, my lord, are pleasant words, open your speech and clear;

Why were you dumb, when you did see father and mother near?â

33. âNo handicapped man I for lack of joints, nor deaf for lack of ears,

I am not dumb for want of tongue as plainly now appears.


34. In an old birth I played the king, as I remember well,

But when I fell from that estate I found myself in hell.


35. Some twenty years of luxury I passed upon that throne,

But eighty thousand years in hell did for that guilt atone.
 {6.17}


36. My former taste of royalty filled all my heart with fear;

Thence was I dumb, although I saw father and mother near.


37. My father took me on his lap, but midst his fondling play,

I heard the stern commands he gave, âAt once this miscreant slay,

Saw him in sunder â go, that wretch impale without delay.â


38. Hearing such threats well might I try be handicapped and dumb to be,

And wallow helplessly in filth, an idiot willingly.


39. Knowing that life is short at best and filled with miseries,

Who âgainst another for its sake would let his anger rise?


40. Who on another for its sake would let his vengeance light,

Through want of power to grasp the truth and blindness to the right? 
The four lines of triumph are here repeated. [I include them here.]

43. âI too would choose thâ asceticâs life with you;

Call me, O prince, for I as you would be.â

44. âRestore the chariot first, youâre not a free man now;

First pay your debts, they say â then take the asceticâs vow.â

45. âSince I have done your bidding, prince, I pray,

Do you be pleased to do what I shall say.


46. Stay till I fetch the king â stay here of grace,

He will be joyful when he sees your face.â
 {6.19}

47. âWell, be it as you sayest, charioteer;

I too would gladly see my father here.


48. Go and salute my kindred all, and take

A special message for my parentsâ sake.â

49. âHe clasped his feet and, all due honours paid,

Started to journey as his teacher bade.â

50. âSeeing the empty car and lonely charioteer,

The motherâs eyes were filled with tears, her breast with fear:


51. The charioteer comes back â my son is slain;

Yonder he lies, earth mixed with earth again.


52. Our bitterest foes may well rejoice, alack!

Seeing his murderer come safely back.
 [6.13]


53. Dumb, handicapped â could he not give one cry,

As on the ground he struggled helplessly?


54. Could not his hands and feet force you away,

Though dumb and maimed, while on the ground he lay?â
 {6.20}

55. âPromise me pardon, lady, for my word,

And I will tell you all I saw and heard.â

56. âPardon I promise you for every word;

Tell me in full whateâer you saw or heard.â

57. âNot handicapped, he is not deaf â his utterance is clear and free;

He played fictitious parts at home, through dread of royalty.


58. In an old birth he played the king as he remembers well,

But when he fell from that estate he found himself in hell.


59. Some twenty years of luxury he passed upon that throne,

But eighty thousand years in hell did for that guilt atone.


60. His former taste of royalty filled all his heart with fear;

Hence was he dumb although he saw father and mother near.


61. Perfectly sound in all his limbs, faultlessly tall and broad,

His utterance clear, his wits undimmed, he treads on heavenâs road.


62. If you desire to see your son, then come at once with me,

You shall behold prince Temiya, perfectly calm and free.â
 {6.21}

63. âThe horses to the chariots yoke â bind girths on elephants and come;

Sound conch and tabour far and wide, and wake the loud-voiced kettledrum.


64. Let the hoarse tomtom fill the air, let rattling drums raise echoes sweet,

Bid all this city follow me â I go my son once more to greet.


65. Let palace-ladies, every prince, vesiyas and brahmins every one,

All have their chariot-horses yoked â I go to welcome back my son.


66. Let elephant-riders, royal guards, horsemen and footmen every one,

Let all alike prepare to go, I go to welcome back my son.


67. Let country folk and city folk gather in crowds in every street,

Let all alike prepare to go, I go once more my son to greet.â
 {6.22}

68. âSindh horses of the noblest breed stood harnessed at the palace gates;

The charioteers the tidings bring: âThe train, my lord, your presence waits.â â

69. âLeave all the clumsy horses out, no weaklings in our cavalcade,

(They told the charioteer, âBe sure not to bring horses of that kind,â)

Such were the royal orders given, and such the charioteers obeyed.â

70. âHis royal chariot then prepared, the king without delay

Got in, and cried out to his wives: âCome with me all away!â


71. With yaks-tail fan and turban crest, and royal white sunshade,

He mounted in the royal car, 
upÄdhirathaá¹
: Commentator: 
suvaá¹á¹apÄdukÄrathaá¹ Äruyhantu, ime tayo pÄde puttassa tattheva abhisekakaraá¹atthÄya paÃ±ca rÄjakakudhabhaá¹á¸Äni ganhathÄ ti
.
 with finest gold arrayed.


72. Then did the king set forth at once, his charioteer beside,

And quickly came where Temiya all tranquil did abide.
 {6.23}


73. When Temiya beheld him come all brilliant and ablaze,

Surrounded by attendant bands of warriors, thus he says:
 [6.15]


74. âFather, I hope âtis well with you, you have good news to tell,

I hope that all the royal queens, my mothers, too, are well?â


75. âYes, it is well with me, my son, I have good news to tell,

And all the royal queens indeed, your mothers, all are well.â


76. âI hope you drinkest no strong drink, all spirit do eschew,

To righteous deeds and almsgiving your mind is ever true?â


77. âOh yes, strong drink I never touch, all spirit I eschew,

To righteous deeds and almsgiving my mind is ever true.â


78. âThe horses and the elephants I hope are well and strong,

No painful bodily disease, no weakness, nothing wrong?â


79. âOh yes, the elephants are well, the horses well and strong,

No painful bodily disease, no weakness, nothing wrong.â


80. âThe frontiers, as the central part, all populous, at peace,

The treasures and the treasuries quite full â say, what of these?


81. Now welcome to you, royal sir, O welcome now to you!

Let them set out a couch, that here seated the king may be.â â

82. âBe seated on this bed of leaves spread for you as is meet,

They will take water from this spot and duly wash your feet.â

83. âNo salt have I, this leaf alone is what I live upon, O king;

You are come here a guest of mine â be pleased to accept the fare I bring.â

84. âNo leaves for me, thatâs not my fare; give me a bowl of pure hill rice,

Cooked with a subtle flavouring of meat 
cf. 
supra,
 iii. 29
09
.
 to make the pottage nice.

85. âMost strange indeed it seems to me that you thus left alone

Live on such mean food and yet your colour is not gone.â 
[6.16] {6.25}

86. âUpon this bed of leaves strewn here I lie indeed alone â

A pleasant bed it is and so my colour is not gone;


87. Girt with their swords no cruel guards stand sternly looking on â

A pleasant bed it is and so my colour is not gone;


88. Over the past I do not mourn nor for the future weep â

I meet the present as it comes, and so my colour keep.


89. Mourning about the hopeless past or some uncertain future need â

This dries a young manâs vigour up as when you cut a fresh green reed.â

90. âMy elephants, my chariots, horsemen, and infantry,

And all my pleasant palaces, dear son, I give to thee.


91. My queenâs apartments too I give, with all their pomp and pride,

You shall be sole king over us â there shall be none beside.


92. Fair women skilled in dance and song and trained for every mood

Shall lap your soul in ease and joy â why linger in this wood?


93. The daughters of your foes shall come proud but to wait on thee;

When they have borne you sons, then an ascetic go to be.


94. Come, O my first-born and my heir, in the first glory of thine age,

Enjoy your kingdom to the full â what do you in this hermitage?â

95. âNo, let the young man leave the world and fly its vanities,

The asceticâs life best suits the young â thus counsel all the wise. 
{6.26}


96. No, let the young man leave the world, an ascetic and alone;

I will embrace the asceticâs life, I need no pomp nor throne.


97. I watch the boy â with childish lips he father mother, cries:

Himself begets a son, and then he too grows old and dies.


98. So the young daughter in her flower grows blithe and fair to see,

But she soon fades cut down by death like the green bamboo tree.


99. Men, women all, however young, soon perish â who in truth

Would put his trust in mortal life, cheated by fancied youth?


100. As night by night gives place to dawn life still contracts its span;

Like fish in water which dries up â what means the youth of man?


101. This world of ours is smitten sore, is ever watched by one,

They pass and pass with purpose fell â why talk of crown or throne?


102. Who sorely smites this world of ours? Who watches grimly by?

And who thus pass with purpose fell? Tell me the mystery.


103. âTis death who smites this world, old age who watches at our gate,

And âtis the nights which pass and win their purpose soon or late.


104. As when the lady at her loom sits weaving all the day,

Her task grows ever less and less â so waste our lives away.


105. As speeds the hurrying riverâs course, on with no backward flow,

So in its course the life of men does ever forward go;


106. And as the river sweeps away trees from its banks uptorn,

So are we men by age and death in headlong ruin borne.â
 [6.17] {6.27}

107. âMy elephants, my chariots, horsemen, and infantry,

And all my pleasant palaces, dear son, I give to you.


108. My queenâs apartments too I give, with all their pomp and pride,

You shall be sole king over us â there shall be none beside.


109. Fair women skilled in dance and song and trained for every mood

Shall lap your soul in ease and joy, why linger in this wood?


110. The daughters of your foes shall come proud but to wait on you;

When they have borne you sons, then go an ascetic to be.


111. My treasures and my treasuries, footmen and cavalry,

And all my pleasant palaces, dear son, I give to you.


112. With troops of slaves to wait on you, and queens to be embraced,

Enjoy your throne, all health to you, why linger in this waste?â

113. âWhy seek for wealth â it will not last; why woo a wife â she soon will die;

Why think of youth, âtwill soon be past; and threatening age stands ever nigh.


114. What are the joys that life can bring? Beauty, sport, wealth, or royal fare?

What is a wife or child to me? I am set free from every snare.


115. This thing I know â whereâer I go, fate watching never slumbereth;

Of what avail is wealth or joy to one who feels the grasp of death? 
 {6.28}


116. Do what you have to do today, who can ensure the morrowâs sun?

Death is the teacher-general who gives his guarantee to none.


117. Thieves ever watch to steal our wealth â I am set free from every chain;

Go back and take your crown away; what want I with a kingâs domain?â

The Teacher, having brought his lesson to an end, said: âNot only now but formerly also did I leave a kingdom and become an ascetic.â Then he identified the JÄtaka: âThe DevadhÄ«tÄ in the umbrella was Uppalavaá¹á¹Ä, 
{6.30}
 the charioteer was SÄriputta, the father and mother were the royal family, the court was the Buddhaâs Saá¹gha, and the wise MÅ«gapakkha was myself.â 
A later addition here describes how certain priests were later than the others in adopting the ascetic life, in this birth, cf. 
JÄ
t.
 iv. 490.


After they had come to the island of Ceylon, elder Khuddakatissa, a native of Maá¹gaá¹a, elder MahÄvaá¹saka, elder Phussadeva, who dwelt at Kaá¹­akandhakÄra,

 elder MahÄrakkhita, a native of Uparimaá¹á¸akamÄla, elder MahÄtissa, a native of Bhaggari, elder MahÄsiva, a native of VÄmattapabbhÄra, elder MahÄmaliyadeva, a native of KÄá¸·avela â all these elders are called the late comers in the assembly of the KuddÄlaka birth [Ja 70], the MÅ«gapakkha birth [Ja 538], the Ayoghara birth [Ja 510], and the HatthipÄla birth [Ja 509].


Moreover elder MahÄnÄga, a native of Maddha, and elder MaliyamakÄdeva, 
[6.19]
 remarked on the day of the PÄrÄ«nibbÄna, âSir, the assembly of the MÅ«gapakkha birth is today extinct.â âWherefore?â âI was then passionately addicted to spirituous drink, and when I could not bring those with me who used to drink liquor with me I was the last of all to give up the world and become an ascetic.â

## Analysis
In the present the monks are discussing the Great Renunciation. The Buddha tells a story about a prince brought up in exile, who sailed on a merchantâs ship. When everyone else died at sea, through his effort he survived long enough for a DevadhÄ«tÄ to help him get to his city and inheritance. After ruling well for a long time, gaining wisdom, he renounced his kingdom and became an ascetic.

## Full Story
âWho are you, striving manfully.â
 This story the Teacher, while dwelling at Jetavana, told concerning the Great Renunciation. One day the monks sat in the Dhamma Hall discussing the TathÄgataâs Great Renunciation. The Teacher came and found that this was their subject; so he said: âThis is not the first time that the TathÄgata performed the Great Renunciation â he performed it also formerly.â And herewith he told a story of the past.

1. âWho are you, striving manfully here in mid-ocean far from land?

Who is the friend you trustest in, to lend to you a helping hand?â

2. âKnowing my duty in the world, to strive, DevatÄ, while I can,

Here in mid ocean far from land I do my utmost like a man.â

3. âHere in this deep and boundless waste where shore is none to meet the eye,

Your utmost strivings are in vain â here in mid-ocean you must die.â

4. âHe who does all a man can do is free from guilt towards his kin,

The lord of heaven acquits him too and he feels no remorse within.â

5. âWhat use in strivings such as these, where barren toil is all the gain,

Where there is no reward to win, and only death for all your pain?â

6. âHe who thinks there is nought to win and will not battle while he may â

Be his the blame whateâer the loss â âtwas his faint heart that lost the day.


7. Men in this world devise their plans, and do their business as seems best â

The plans may prosper or may fail â the unknown future shows the rest.


8. See you not, DevatÄ, today âtis our own actions which decide;

Drowned are the others â I am saved, and you are standing by my side.


9. So I will ever do my best to fight through ocean to the shore;

While strength holds out I still will strive, nor yield till I can strive no more.â
 {6.37}

10. âYou who thus bravely fightest on amidst this fierce unbounded sea,

Nor shrinkest from the appointed task, striving where duty calleth thee,

Go where your heart would have you go, nor let nor hindrance shall there be.â 
[6.24]

11. âThe treasure of the rising sun, the treasure at his setting seen,

The treasure outside, that within, and that not outside nor within, 
{6.38}


12. At thâ mounting, at the dismounting, SÄl-pillars four, the yojana round,

The end of thâ teeth, the end of thâ tail, the kebuka, thâ ends of the trees â


13. The sixteen precious treasures these, and these remain, where these are found,

The bow that tasks a thousand men, the bed, the ladyâs heart to please.â

20. âOur king, the lord of all the earth, is changed from what he was of old,

He heeds no joyous song today nor cares the dancers to behold;


21. The deer, the garden, and the swans fail to attract his absent eye,

Silent he sits as stricken dumb and lets the cares of state pass by.â

22. âHid from all sight, intent on bliss, freed from all bonds and mortal fears,

In whose fair garden, old and young, together dwell those heavenly seers? 
{6.46}


23. They have left all desires behind â those happy glorious saints I bless,

Amidst a world by passion tossed they roam at peace and passionless.


24. They have all burst the net of death, and the deceiverâs outspread snare â

Freed from all ties, they roam at will â O who will guide me where they are?â
 [6.30]

25-115. 
A long description, full of repetitions, is here much condensed. 
 âWhen shall I leave this MithilÄ, spacious and splendid though it be,

By architects with rule and line laid out in order fair to see,


With walls and gates and battlements â traversed by streets on every side,

With horses, cows, and chariots thronged, 
{6.47}
 with tanks and gardens beautified,


Videhaâs far-famed capital, alive with knights and warrior swarms,

Clad in their robes of tiger-skins, with banners spread and flashing arms,


Its brahmins dressed in KÄsi cloth, perfumed with sandal, decked with gems â

Its palaces and all their queens with robes of state and diadems!


When shall I leave them and go forth, the asceticâs lonely bliss to win â

Carrying my rags and waterpot â when will that happy life begin?


When shall I wander through the woods, eating their hospitable fruit,

Tuning my heart in solitude as one might tune a seven-stringed lute, 
See 
MahÄvagga,
 v. 1. 16.


Cutting my spirit free from hope of present or of future gain,

As the cobbler 
The use of the word 
rathakÄro
 might suggest âwooden shoes,â but these were forbidden by Buddha, see 
MahÄvagga,
 v. 6.
 when he shapes his shoe cuts off rough ends and leaves it plain.â 
cf. Vol. iv. p. 172 (text).
 
{6.52}

116-122. âThere stood the seven hundred queens, stretching their arms in pleading woe,

Arrayed in all their ornaments â Great king, why do you leave us so?


But leaving those seven hundred queens, fair, tender, gracious â the great king

Followed the guidance of his vow, with stern resolve unfaltering.


Leaving the inaugurating cup, 
For the golden jars used at a kingâs inauguration see 
RÄmÄyaá¹a
 ii. 15, 
KathÄsaritsÄgara
 xv. 77.
 the old sign of royal pomp and state,

He takes his earthen pot today, a new career to inaugurate.â
 {6.54}

123. âTerrible are the raging fires, the stores and treasures burn,

The silver, gold, gems, shells, and pearls, are all consumed in turn;


124. Rich garments, ivory, copper, skins â all meet one ruthless fate;

Turn back, O king, and save your wealth before it be too late.â

125. We who have nothing of our own may live without a care or sigh;

MithilÄâs palaces may burn, but naught of mine is burned thereby.â 
These lines seem proverbial in various shapes, cf. Dhp 200; 
MahÄbhÄrata
 xii. 9917, 529, 6641.
 
[6.32] {6.55}

126. âWild foresters lay waste the land â return, and save us all;

Let not your kingdom, left by you, in hopeless ruin fall.â

127. âWe who have nothing of our own may live without a care or sigh,

The kingdom may lie desolate, but naught of mine is harmed thereby.


128. We who have nothing of our own may live without a care or sigh â

Feasting on joy in full bliss like Äbhassara Deva on high.â 
For these heavenly beings, âthe Radiant ones,â see Burnouf, 
Introd.
 p. 611.

129. âWherefore is all this noise and din, as of a village holiday?

Why is this crowd assembled here? Will the ascetic kindly say?â

130. âIâve crossed the bound and left the world, âtis this has brought these hosts of men;

I leave them with a joyous heart: you know it all â why ask me then?â 
{6.57}

131. âThink not you have already crossed, while with this body still beset;

There are still many foes in front â you have not won your victory yet.â

132. âNor pleasures known nor those unknown have power my steadfast soul to bend,

What foe can stay me in my course as I press onwards to the end?â

133. âSleep, sloth, loose thoughts to pleasure turned, surfeit, a discontented mind â

The body brings these bosom-guests â many a hindrance shall you find.â

 my heavenly rest

I have just left to tell you this â to associate with the wise is best.


136. The four perfections exercise â find in this path your highest joy;

Whateâer it be you lackest yet, by patience and by calm supply;


137. High thoughts of self, low thoughts of self â nor this, nor that befits the sage;

Be virtue, knowledge, and the law the guardians of your pilgrimage.â

138. âHorses and elephants, and they who in city or in country dwell â

You have left them all, O Janaka: an earthen bowl contents you well.


139. Say, have your subjects or your friends, your ministers or kinsmen dear,

Wounded your heart by treachery that you have chosen this refuge here?â

140. âNever, O seer, at any time, in any place, on any plea,

Have I done wrong to any friend nor any friend done wrong to me. 
[6.34]


141. I saw the world devoured by pain, darkened with misery and with lust;

I watched its victims bound and slain, caught helplessly its toils within;

I drew the warning to myself and here the asceticâs life begin.â 
{6.60}

142. âNone chooses the asceticâs life unless some teacher point the way,

By practice or by theory: who was your holy teacher, say.â

143. âNever at any time, O seer, have I heard words that touched my heart

From brahmin or ascetic lips, bidding me choose the asceticâs part.â

144. âI wandered through my royal park one summerâs day in all my pride,

With songs and tuneful instruments filling the air on every side,


145. And there I saw a mango tree, which near the wall had taken root â

It stood all broken and despoiled by the rude crowds that sought its fruit.


146. Startled I left my royal pomp and stopped to gaze with curious eye,

Contrasting with this fruitful tree a barren one which grew close by.


147. The fruitful tree stood there forlorn, its leaves all stripped, its branches bare,

The barren tree stood green and strong, its foliage waving in the air.
 {6.61}


148. We kings are like that fruitful tree, with many a foe to lay us low,

And rob us of the pleasant fruit which for a little while we show.


149. The elephant for ivory, the panther for his skin is slain,

Houseless and friendless at the last the wealthy find their wealth their bane;

That pair of trees my teachers were â from them my lesson did I gain.â

150. âIn chariots or on elephants, footmen or horsemen, all as one,

Your subjects raise a common wail: âOur king has left us and is gone!â


151. O comfort first their stricken hearts and crown your son to rule instead;

Then, if you will, forsake the world the pilgrimâs lonely path to tread.â

152. âIâve left behind my subjects all, friends, kinsmen, home and native land; 
{6.62}

But thâ nobles of Videha race, DÄ«ghÄvu trained to bear command â

Fear not, O queen of MithilÄ, they will be near to uphold your hand.â

153. âIf you would teach my son to rule, doing wrong in thought, word and deed,

An evil ending will be thine â this is the destiny decreed;

A beggarâs portion, gained as alms, so say the wise, is all our need.â

154. âShould the fourth eating-time come round, a man will die if still he fast;

Yet for all that the noble soul would loathe so foul a mess to taste;


155. This is not right which you have done â shame on you, shame, I say, O king;

Eating the leavings of a dog, you have done a most unworthy thing.â

156. âLeavings of householder or dog are not forbidden food, I ween; 
{6.64}

If it be gained by lawful means, all food is pure and lawful, queen.â

157. âNestling beneath your motherâs care, girl, with those trinkets on you bound,

Why is one arm so musical while the other never makes a sound?â

158. âAscetic, on this hand I wear two bracelets fast instead of one,

âTis from their contact that they sound â âtis by the second this is done. 
[6.36]


159. But mark this other hand of mine: a single bracelet it does wear,

That keeps its place and makes no sound, silent because no otherâs there.


160. The second jangles and makes jars, that which is single cannot jar;

Would you be happy? Be alone; only the lonely happy are.â
 {6.65}

161. âHear what she says; this servant girl would overwhelm my head with shame

Were I to yield to your request; it is the second brings the blame.


162. Here are two paths: do you take one, the other by myself take I;

Call me not husband from henceforth, you are no more my wife: goodbye.â

163. âWith these words on their lips they entered the city of ThÅ«á¹Ä.â
 {6.66}

164. âTo a fletcherâs house he came for alms; the man with one eye closed did stand,

And with the other sideways looked to shape the arrow in his hand.â

165. âOne eye you closest and do gaze with the other sideways â is this right?

I pray, explain your attitude; thinkest you, it improves your sight?â

166. âThe wide horizon of both eyes serves only to distract the view;

But if you get a single line, your aim is fixed, your vision true.


167. It is the second that makes jars, that which is single cannot jar;

Would you be happy? Be alone; only the lonely happy are.â
 {6.67}

168. âYou hear the fletcher: like the girl, he would oâerwhelm my head with shame

Were I to yield to your request; it is the second brings the blame.


169. Here are two paths: do you take one, the other by myself take I;

Call me not husband from henceforth, you are no more my wife: goodbye.â
 [6.37]

170. âLike to a muÃ±ja reed full-grown, live on, O SÄ«valÄ«, alone.â

The Teacher, his lesson ended, said: âThis is not the first time that the TathÄgata performed the Great Renunciation; he performed it also formerly.â So saying he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the sea DevadhÄ«tÄ was Uppalavaá¹á¹Ä, NÄrada was SÄriputta, MigÄjina was MoggallÄna, the girl was the princess KhemÄ, the maker of arrows was Änanda, SÄ«valÄ« was the mother of RÄhula, prince DÄ«ghÄvu was RÄhula, the parents were the members of the royal family, and I myself was the king MahÄjanaka.â

In the present one monk supports his parents who have fallen into poverty and have no one left at home to support them. The Buddha tells a story of a boy born to two ascetics, who supported them when they were blinded by a snake. A king who is out on a hunt kills the boy, but offers to undertake his duties. Eventually the boy is brought back to life, and the parents also regain their sight.

## Full Story
âWho, as I filled.â
 
[6.38]
 This story the Teacher told at Jetavana, about a certain monk who supported his mother. They say that there was a wealthy merchant at SÄvatthi, who was worth eighteen crores; and he had a son who was very dear and winning to his father and mother. One day the youth went upon the terrace of the house, and opened a window and looked down on the street; and when he saw the great crowd going to Jetavana with perfumes and garlands in their hands to hear the Dhamma preached, 
{6.69}
 he exclaimed that he would go too.


So having ordered perfumes and garlands to be brought, he went to the monastery, and having distributed robes, medicines, drinks, etc. to the assembly and honoured the Fortunate One with perfumes and garlands, he sat down on one side. After hearing the Dhamma, and perceiving the evil consequences of desire and the blessings arising from adopting the ascetic life, when the assembly broke up he asked the Fortunate One for ordination, but he was told that the TathÄgatas do not ordain anyone who has not obtained the permission of his parents; so he went away, and lived a week without food, and having at last obtained his parentsâ consent, he returned and begged for ordination. The Teacher sent a monk who ordained him; and after he was ordained he obtained great honour and gain; he won the favour of his teachers and preceptors, and having received full orders he mastered the Dhamma in five years.


Then he thought to himself, âI live here distracted â it is not suitable for me,â and he became anxious to reach the goal of spiritual insight; so having obtained instruction in meditation from his teacher, he departed to a frontier village and dwelt in the forest, and there having entered a course of insight, however much he laboured and strove for twelve years, he failed to attain any special insight.


His parents also, as time went on, became poor, for those who hired their land or carried on merchandise for them, finding out that there was no son or brother in the family to enforce the payment, seized what they could lay their hands upon and ran away as they pleased, and the servants and labourers in the house seized the gold and coin and made off therewith, so that at the end the two were reduced to an evil plight and had not even a jug for pouring water; and at last they sold their dwelling, and finding themselves homeless, and in extreme misery, they wandered begging for alms, clothed in rags and carrying potsherds in their hands.


Now at that time a monk came from Jetavana to the sonâs place of abode; he performed the duties of hospitality and, as he sat quietly, he first asked whence he was come; and learning that he was come from Jetavana he asked after the health of the Teacher and the principal disciples and then asked for news of his parents, âTell me, sir, about the welfare of such and such a merchantâs family in SÄvatthi.â âO friend, donât ask for news of that family.â âWhy not, sir?â âThey say that there was one son in that family, but he has become an ascetic in this dispensation, and since he left the world that family has gone to ruin; and at the present time the two old people are reduced to a most lamentable state and beg for alms.â


When he heard the otherâs words he could not remain unmoved, but began to weep with his eyes full of tears, and when the other asked him why he wept, âO sir,â he replied, âthey are my own father and mother, I am their son.â âO friend, your father and mother have come to ruin through you â do you go and take care of them.â âFor twelve years,â he thought to himself, âI have laboured and striven but never been able to attain the Path or the Fruit: 
{6.70}
 I must be incompetent; what have I to do with the ascetic life? I will become a householder and will support my parents and give away my wealth, and will thus eventually become destined for 
[6.39]
 heaven.â


So having determined he gave up his abode in the forest to the elder, and the next day departed and by successive stages reached the monastery at the back of Jetavana which is not far from SÄvatthi. There he found two roads, one leading to Jetavana, the other to SÄvatthi. As he stood there, he thought: âShall I see my parents first or the One with Ten Powers?â Then he said to himself, âIn old days I saw my parents for a long time, from henceforth I shall rarely have the chance of seeing the Buddha; I will see the Fully Awakened One today and hear the Dhamma, and then tomorrow morning I will see my parents.â So he left the road to SÄvatthi and in the evening arrived at Jetavana.


Now that very day at daybreak, the Teacher, as he looked upon the world, had seen the potentialities of this young man, and when he came to visit him he praised the virtues of parents in the MÄtiposakasutta [SN 7.19].

BrÄhmaá¹asaá¹yutta
, ii. 9. [i.e. SN 7.19.]
 As he stood at the end of the assembly of elders and listened, he thought: âIf I become a householder I can support my parents; but the Teacher also says, âA son who has become an ascetic can be helpful,â I went away before, without seeing the Teacher, and I failed in such an imperfect ordination; I will now support my parents while still remaining an ascetic without becoming a householder.â So he took his ticket and his ticket-food 
[There are a number of ways monks can collect almsfood, and being given a ticket for the food is one of them.]
 and gruel, and felt as if he had committed a wrong deserving expulsion after a solitary abode of twelve years in the forest. In the morning he went to SÄvatthi and he thought to himself, âShall I first get the gruel or see my parents?â He reflected that it would not be right to visit them in their poverty empty-handed; so he first got the gruel and then went to the door of their old house.


When he saw them sitting by the opposite wall after having gone their rounds for the alms given in broth, he stood not far from them in a sudden burst of sorrow with his eyes full of tears. They saw him but knew him not; then his mother, thinking that it was someone standing for alms, said to him, âWe have nothing fit to be given to you, be pleased to pass on.â When he heard her, he repressed the grief which filled his heart and remained still standing as before with his eyes full of tears, and when he was addressed a second and a third time he still continued standing.


At last the father said to the mother, âGo to him; can this be your son?â 
Reading

 Prof. Cowell, omitting 
gaccha,
 translates: âWho is this who is as a son of your own?â
 She rose and went to him and, recognising him, fell at his feet and lamented, and the father also joined his lamentations, and there was a loud outburst of sorrow. To see his parents he could not control himself, but burst into tears; then, after yielding to his feelings, he said: âDo not grieve, I will 
{6.71}
 support you,â so having comforted them and made them drink some gruel, and sit down on one side, he went again and begged for some food and gave it to them, and then went and asked for alms for himself, and having finished his meal, took up his abode at a short distance off.


From that day forward he watched over his parents in this manner; he gave them all the alms he received for himself, even those at the fortnightly distributions, and he went on separate expeditions for his own alms, and ate them; and whatever food he received as provision for the rainy season he gave to them, while he took their worn-out garments and dyed them with the doors fast closed and used them himself; but the days were few when he gained alms and there were many when he failed to win anything, and his inner and outer clothing became very rough.


As he watched over his parents he gradually grew very pale and thin and his friends and intimates said to him, âYour complexion used to be bright, but now you have become very pale â has some illness come upon you?â He replied, âNo illness has come upon me, but a hindrance has befallen me,â and he told them the history. âSir,â they replied, âthe Teacher does not allow us to waste the offerings of the faithful, you do an unlawful act in giving to laymen the offerings of the faithful.â When he heard this he shrank away ashamed.


But not satisfied with this they went and told it to the Teacher, saying: âSo and so, sir, has wasted the offerings of the faithful and used them to feed laymen.â The Teacher sent for the young man of family and said to him, âIs it true that you, an ascetic, take the 
[6.40]
 offerings of the faithful and support laymen with them?â He confessed that it was true. Then the Teacher, wishing to praise what he had done and to declare an old action of his own, said: âWhen you support laymen whom do you support?â âMy parents,â he answered. Then the Teacher, wishing to encourage him still more said: âWell done, well done,â three times, âYou are in a path which I have traversed before you: in old time, while going the rounds for alms, I also supported my parents.â The ascetic was encouraged thereby. At the request of the monks the Teacher, to make known his former actions, told them a story of the past.

1. âWho, as I filled my water-jar, has from his ambush wounded me â

Brahmin or Khattiya, Vessa â who can my unknown assailant be?â

2. âYou can not take my flesh for food, you can not turn to use my skin;

Why could you think me worth thine aim; what was the gain you thought to win?â

3. âWho are you, say â whose son are you? And what name shall I call you by?

Why do you lie in ambush there? Answer my questions truthfully.â

4. âI of the KÄsis am the lord, king Piliyakkha named; and here,

Leaving my throne for greed of flesh, I roam to hunt the forest deer.


5. Skilled in the archerâs craft am I, stout is my heart nor given to change;

No NÄga can escape my shaft if once he comes within my range.â
 {6.78}

6. âBut who are you? Whose son are you? How are you called? Your name make known;

Your fatherâs name and family â tell me your fatherâs and thine own.â

7. âThey called me SÄma while I lived â an outcaste hunterâs son am I;

But here stretched out upon the ground in woeful plight you see me lie.


8. Pierced by that poisoned shaft of thine, I helpless lie like any deer,

The victim of your fatal skill, bathed in my blood I wallow here.


9. Your shaft has pierced my body through, I vomit blood with every breath,

Yet, faint and weak, I ask you still, why from your ambush seek my death?


10. You cannot take my flesh for food, you cannot turn to use my skin;

Why could you think me worth your aim; what was the gain you thought to win?â
 [6.45]

11. âA deer had come within my range, I thought that it my prize would be,

But seeing you it fled in fright â I had no angry thought for you.â 
{6.79}

12. Since my first years of thought began, as far as memory reaches back,

No quiet deer or beast of prey has fled in fear to cross my track.


13. Since I first donned my dress of bark and left behind my childish days

No quiet deer or beast of prey has fled to see me cross their ways.


14. Nay, the Kimpurisas are friends, who roam with me this forestâs shade,

Why should this deer then, as you say, at seeing me have fled afraid?â

15. âSÄma, no deer beheld you there, why should I tell a needless lie?

I was oâercome by wrath and greed and shot that arrow â it was I.â

16. âWhence did you come this morning, friend â who bade you take your water-jar

And fill it from the riverâs bank and bear the burden back so far?â 
{6.80}

17. âMy parents live in yonder wood, blind and dependent on my care,

For their sakes to the riverâs bank I came to fill my water-jar.â

18. âTheir life is but a flickering spark, 
The Commentator explains 
usÄ
 as âfood,â I have taken it as = 
uá¹£mÄ.
 This is also given as an alternative by the Commentator. This word however occurs in Pali as 
usmÄ
 or 
usumÄ
.
 their food at most a weekâs supply â

Without this water which I bring blind, weak, and helpless they will die.


19. I reek not of the pain of death, that is the common fate of all;

Neâer more to see my motherâs face â âtis this which does my heart appall.


20. I reek not of the pain of death, that is the common fate of all;

Neâer more to see my fatherâs face â âtis this which does my heart appall.


21. Long, long, a sad and weary time my mother there will nurse her woe,

At midnight and at early morn her tears will like a river flow. 
Lit. they will only grow dry as a river does.


22. Long, long, a sad and weary time my father there will nurse his woe,

At midnight and at early morn his tears will like a river flow.


23. They will go wandering through the wood and of their tarrying son complain,

Expecting still to hear my step or feel my soothing touch â in vain.


24. This thought is as a second shaft which pierces deeper than before,

That I, alas, lie dying here, fated to see their face no more.â
 [6.46] {6.81}

25. âO SÄma of auspicious face, let not despair your soul oppress,

Lo I myself will wait upon your parents in their lone distress.


26. I am well practised with the bow â my promise is a surety good â

Iâll be a substitute for you and nurse your parents in the wood.


27. Iâll search for leavings of the deer, and roots and fruits to meet their need;

Iâll wait myself upon them both, their household slave in very deed.


28. Which is the forest where they are? Tell me, O SÄma, for I vow

I will protect and foster them as you thyself have done till now.â

29. âWhere my head lies there runs a path two hundred bow lengths through the trees,

âTwill lead you to my parentsâ hut â go, nurse them there if so you please.â 
{6.82}

30. âHonour to you, O KÄsi king, as thus you go upon your way;

Helpless my parents are and blind â O guard and nurse them both, I pray.


31. Honour to you, O KÄsi king â I fold my hands respectfully,

Bear to my parents in my name the message I have given to you.â

32. âWhen SÄma of auspicious face thus to the king these words had said,

Faint with the poison of the shaft he lay unconscious as if dead.â

33. âBitterly did the king lament, I knew not until this befell.

That I should eâer grow old or die â I know it now, alas, too well.


34. All men are mortal, now I see; for even SÄma had to die,

Who gave good counsel to the last, yes in his dying agony;
 {6.83}


35-36. Hell is my sure and certain doom â that murdered saint lies speechless there;

In every village all I meet will with one voice my guilt declare.


37. But in this lone unpeopled wood who will there be to know my name?

Here in this desert solitude who will remind me of my shame?â

38. âThe DevatÄ, hidden out of sight on GandhamÄdana mount,

Uttered these verses in his ears, by pity moved on his account;


39. A wicked action have you done â heavy the guilt which rests on you;

Parents and son all innocent, your single shaft hath slain the three;


40. Come, I will tell you how to find a refuge from your guilt and rest;

Nurse the blind pair in yonder wood, so shall your sinful soul be blessed.â

41. âAfter a burst of bitter tears, lamenting for the hapless youth,

The king took up the water-jar and turned his face towards the south.â 
{6.85}

42-43. âWhose are these footsteps which I hear? Someone approaches by this way;

âTis not the sound of SÄmaâs steps â who are you â tell me, sir, I pray.â

44. âI of the KÄsis am the lord, king Piliyakkha named; and here,

Leaving my throne for greed of flesh, I roam to hunt the forest deer.


45. Skilled in the archerâs craft am I, stout is my heart nor given to change;

No NÄga can escape my shaft if once he comes within my range.â

46. âWelcome, O king, a happy chance directed you this way:

Mighty you are and glorious: what errand brings you, pray?


47. The tindook and the piyal leaves, and kÄsumÄrÄ« sweet,

Though few and little, take the best we have, O king, and eat.


48. And this cool water from a cave high hidden on a hill,

O mighty monarch, take of it, drink if it be your will.â
 {6.86}

49. âHow can a blind man roam the woods? These fruits â who brought them to your door?

He must have had good eyes I think, who gathered such a varied store.â

50. âSÄma our son is young in years, not very tall but fair to the eye,

The long black hair that crowns his head curls like a dogâs tail 
cf. HitopadeÅa, ii. 135. âEven whilst being raised to honour, a bad man invariably reverts to his natural habit; as a dogâs tail, after all the expedients of sudorifics and unguents, remains curled.â I read

 naturally.


51. He brought the fruit, and then went off, hastening to fill our water jar;

He will be back here presently â the way to the river is not far.â

52-53. âSÄma, that duteous son of yours, whom you describe so fair, so good,

I have slain him: those black curls of his are lying yonder, drenched in blood.â

54. âTell me, DukÅ«la, who is this who says that SÄma has been slain?

Our SÄma slain â such evil news seem to have cleft my heart in twain.


55. Like a young tender peepul shoot torn by the blast from off the tree,

Our SÄma slain â to hear such news my heart is pierced with agony.â

56. âIt is the king of KÄsi land, his cruel bow has slain, I wot,

Our SÄma by the riverâs bank, but let us pause and curse him not.â

57. âOur darling son, our lifeâs sole stay, longed for and waited for so long,

How shall my heart contain its wrath against the man who did this wrong?â

58. âA darling son, our lifeâs sole stay, longed for and waited for so long!

But all the wise forbid our wrath against the doer of the wrong.â

59. âWeep not, I pray you, overmuch, for your loved SÄmaâs hapless fate;

Lo, I will wait upon you both â mourn not as wholly desolate;


60. I am well practised with the bow, my promise is a surety good,

Lo, I will wait upon you both and nurse you in this lonely wood.


61. Iâll search for leavings of the deer, and roots and fruits for all your need;

Lo, I will wait upon you both, your household slave in very deed.â
 {6.88}

62. âThis is not right, O king of men, this would be utterly unmeet;

You are our lord and rightful king: here we pay homage to your feet.â

63. âYou foresters, proclaim the right, this welcome is true piety;

You are a father from henceforth, and you a mother unto me.â 
[6.50]

64. âGlory to you, O KÄsi-king who are your realmâs prosperity,

Take us and lead us to the spot where SÄma, our loved son, does lie.


65. There fallen prostrate at his feet, touching his face, eyes, every limb, 
If I follow the Commentator who seems to connect 
bhuja
 with 
bhuÃ±jati.
 But could the words mean âbeating our faces, arms and eyesâ? 
Sumh, sumbh
 meaning âto strike.â cf. âto hurt.â The rendering in the text is clearly right: âhisâ not âourâ: but there is nothing to give a clue to the sense of 
saá¹sumbhamÄnÄ
 except the commentatorâs note â
vaá¹­á¹­entÄ
.â

We will await the approach of death, patient so long as near to him.â
 {6.89}

66. âA region full of beasts of prey, as though the worldâs extremest bound,

âTis there where SÄma lies, as if the moon had fallen on the ground.


67. A region full of beasts of prey, as though the worldâs extremest bound,

âTis there where SÄma lies, as if the sun had fallen on the ground.


68. A region 
[This verse was omitted in the translation, I restore it here.]
 full of beasts of prey, as though the worldâs extremest bound,

âTis there where SÄma lies, as if lying crippled upon the ground.


69. At the worldâs furthest end he lies, covered with dust and stained with blood;

Stay rather in your cottage here nor tempt the dangers of the wood.â

70. âLet the wild creatures do their worst, by thousands, millions, let them swarm,

We have no fear of beasts of prey, they cannot do us aught of harm.â

72-85. âCovered with dust and pierced to thâ heart, beholding thus their SÄma lie

Prostrate as if a sun or moon had fallen earthward from the sky,

The parents lifted up their arms, lamenting with a bitter cry.


O SÄma, are you fast asleep? Are angry? Or are we forgot?

Or say, has something vexed your mind, that you liest still and answerest not?


Who will now dress our matted locks and wipe the dirt and dust away,

When SÄma is no longer here, the poor blind coupleâs only stay?


Who now will sweep the floor for us, or bring us water, hot or cold?

Who fetch us forest roots and fruits, as we sit helpless, blind, and old?â
 [6.51] {6.91}

86-93. âIf it be true that in old days SÄma lived always virtuously,

Then may this poison in his veins lose its fell force and harmless be.


If in old days he spoke the truth and nursed his parents night and day,

Then may this poison in his veins be overpowered and ebb away.


Whatever merit we have gained in former days, his sire and I,

May it oâerpower the poisonâs strength and may our darling son not die.â 
Here eight verses have been compressed into three.
 {6.92}

102. âThe DevatÄ hidden out of sight upon GandhamÄdana mount

Performed a solemn act of truth, by pity moved on SÄmaâs count:


103. âHere in GandhamÄdana mount long have I passed my life alone,

In forest depths where every tree beareth a perfume of its own,


104. And none of earthâs inhabitants is dearer to my inmost heart,

As this is true so from his veins may all the poisonâs power depart.â


105. While thus in turn by pity moved they all their solemn witness bore,

Lo in their sight up SÄma sprang, young, fair, and vigorous as before.â

106. âI am your SÄma, safe and well, see me before you and rejoice:

Dry up your tears and weep no more, but greet me with a happy voice.


107. Welcome to you too, mighty king, may fortune wait on your commands;

You are our monarch: let us know what you desirest at our hands.


108. Tiá¹á¸ukas, piyals, madhukas, our choicest fruits we bring our guest,

Fruits sweet as honey to the taste, eat whatsoeâer may please you best.


109. Here is cold water, gracious lord, brought from the caves in yonder hill,

The mountain-stream best quenches thirst, if you are thirsty, drink your fill.â 
See above, p. 48.

110. âI am bewildered and amazed, which way to turn I cannot tell,

An hour ago I saw you dead, who now stand here alive and well!â 
[6.52]

111. âA man possessed of all his powers, with not one thought or feeling fled,

Because a swoon has stopped their play, that living man they think is dead.â

113. âThose mortals who obey Dhamma and nurse their parents in distress,

The gods observe their piety and come to heal their sicknesses.


114. Those mortals who obey Dhamma and nurse their parents in distress,

The gods in this world praise their deed and in the next with heaven them bless.â

115. âI am bewildered more and more, which way to turn I cannot see,

SÄma, to you I fly for help, SÄma, do you my refuge be.â

116. âTowards your parents first of all fulfil your duty, warrior king;

Duty fulfilled in this life here to heaven hereafter you shall bring. 
See Ja 521 
Tesakuá¹ajÄtaka
, 
MahÄvagga
, i. 281.


117. Towards your children and your wife, fulfil your duty, warrior king;

Duty fulfilled in this life here to heaven hereafter you shall bring.


118-121. Duty to friends and ministers, your soldiers with their different arms,

To townships and to villages, your realm with all its subject swarms,


122-123. To ascetics, brahmin holy men, duty to birds and beasts, O king,

Duty fulfilled in this life here to heaven hereafter you shall bring.


124-125. Duty fulfilled brings happiness, yes Sakka, Brahma, all their host,

By following duty won their bliss: duty pursue at any cost.â
 {6.95}

After the lesson, the Teacher said: âO monks, it is an immemorial custom with the wise to support their parents.â He then declared the Truths, after which the monk attained to the Fruit of the First Path, and identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the king was Änanda, the DevadhÄ«tÄ was Uppalavaá¹á¹Ä, Sakka was Anuruddha, the father was Kassapa, the mother was BhaddakÄpilÄnÄ«, and Suvaá¹á¹asÄma was I myself.â

The Birth Story about (King) Nimi (MahÄnipÄta)

## Alternative Titles
No alternative titles available.

## Analysis
In the present the Buddha smiles, and Elder Änanda asks him why. The Buddha tells a story of a king who, seeing a grey hair on his head, renounced the world. His descendants did likewise, and one of them was taken to see the hells and the heavens and was told the deeds people had done to deserve their rebirths.


The Bodhisatta (SammÄsambuddha) = king Nimi (NimirÄjÄ),

the Buddhaâs disciples = the 84,000 nobles (caturÄsÄ«ti khattiyasahassÄni),

Anuruddha = (the King of the Devas) Sakka,

Änanda = (his charioteer) MÄtali.

## Full Story
âLo these grey hairs.â
 
[6.53]
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling in MakhÄdevaâs mango park, near MithilÄ, about a smile. One day at eventide, the Teacher with a large company of monks was walking up and down in this mango park, when he espied a pleasant spot. Being desirous of telling his behaviour in former times, he allowed a smile to be seen on his face. When asked by Elder Änanda why he smiled, he answered, âIn yonder spot, Änanda, I once dwelt, deep in Absorption, in the time of king MakhÄdeva.â Then at his request, he sat down upon a prepared seat, and told a story of the past.

âLo these grey hairs that on my head appear

Take of my life in passing year by year:

They are Devaâs messengers, which remind

The time I must renounce the world is near.â

1. âIt was a marvel in the world how good men did arise

In the days of good king Nimi, the worthy and the wise.


2. Alms gave Videhaâs monarch, the conqueror of his foes;

And as he gave in generosity, this thought in him arose:

âWhich is more fruitful â holy life or giving alms?â Who knows?â 
The commentator says that this doubt occurred to him in the night, and that he could not decide.

3. âThe mighty monarch of the gods, he of the thousand eyes,

Perceives his thought; before his light away the darkness flies.â

4. âWho are you? Or a demigod or Sakkaâs self must be:

For I have never seen or heard such glory as I see.â

5. âSakka, the king of gods, I am; to visit you Iâm here;

Ask what you will, O king, and let your flesh not creep for fear.â

6. âMost puissant lord of all that breathe, this question solve for me:

Holy to live, or alms to give, which should more fruitful be?â


7. Then VÄsava to Nimi spake, solving his question so,

And told the fruit of holy life to him who did not know:


8. âHeâs born a Khattiya, who lives holy in the third degree:

A god, the middle; and the first brings perfect purity.


9. Not easy are these states to win by any generosity,

Which ascetics who have left the world win by austerity.â
 {6.99}

10. âDudÄ«pa, SÄgara, Sela, Mucalinda, BhagÄ«rasa,

UsÄ«nara and Aá¹­á¹­haka, Assaka, and Puthujjana,


11. Yea, kings and brahmins, Khattiya chiefs, many and many a one,

For all their sacrifice, beyond the Peta world came none.â

12-13. âThese holy ascetics who had left the world,

Seven sages, passed beyond: YÄmahanu,

SomayÄga, Manojava, Samudda,

MÄgha, and Bharata, and KÄlikara:

Four others: Kassapa, Aá¹gÄ«rasa,

Akitti, Kisavaccha, these besides.â 
{6.100}

14. âSÄ«dÄâs a river in the north, unnavigable, 
âBecause,â said the commentator, âthe water is so delicate, that even a peacockâs feather will not float, but sinks to the bottom.â 
 deep:

About it, like a fire of reeds, blaze golden mountains steep, 
[6.56]


15. With creepers filled and fragrant plants, river and hills as well.

Thereby ten thousand eremites once on a time did dwell.


16. Noble am I, who kept the vow of temperance, self-control,

Almsgiving: solitary then tended 
The commentator adds 
upatthahiá¹
 to complete the construction. He adds a long dull story to explain how this came about. This verse is quite as abrupt in the original.
 each steadfast soul.


17. Caste or no caste, the upright man I would attend at need:

For every mortal man is bound by his own act and deed.


18. Apart from righteousness, all castes are sure to sink to hell:

All castes are purified if they are righteous and act well.â
 {6.102}

20. âListen to me, sirs, one and all that here assembled be:

Men who are righteous differ much in caste and quality.


21. There is king Nimi, wise and good, the better part who chose â

King of Videha, gave great gifts, that conqueror of his foes;


22. And as these bounteous gifts he gave, behold this doubt arose:

âWhich is more fruitful â holy life or giving alms?â Who knows?â
 {6.103}

23. âA marvel in the world, to make one shiver with delight:

For glorious Videha comes the car divine in sight!â

24-25. âThe mighty MÄtali, the charioteer

Of heaven, summoned now Videhaâs king

Who lived in MithilÄ: Come, noble king,

Lord of the world, upon this chariot mount:

Sakka and all the gods, the Thirty-Three,

Would see you, waiting in SudhammÄ Hall.â

26. âThen with all speed, Videhaâs king arose,

And went towards the chariot, and got in.


27. When he was in it, MÄtali thus spoke:

âBy which road shall I take you, noble king?

Where dwell the wicked, or where dwell the good?â â

28. âMÄtali, charioteer divine, both places I would see:

Both where the righteous men abide, and where the wicked be.â

29. âWhich first, great monarch, noble king â which place first would you see,

That where the righteous men abide, or where the wicked be?â 
{6.105}

30. âIâd see the place of sinful men; please let me go to hell;

Where they who once did cruel deeds and where the wicked dwell.â

31. âMÄtali showed the king Vetaraá¹Ä«,

A river stinking, full of corrosive brine,

Hot, covered all with burning flames of fire.â 
[6.58]

32-33. âThen Nimi, when he saw the people fall

In this deep river-flood, asked MÄtali: 
{6.106}

âFear comes on me to see it, charioteer:

Tell me, what is the wrong these mortals did

Who are cast in the river?â He replied,

Describing how deeds ripen and bear fruit:


34. âWho in the world of life are strong themselves,

Yet hurt the weak, oppress them, doing wrong,

These cruel creatures did do wrong, and they

Are cast into the stream Vetaraá¹Ä«.â â

35-36. âBlack dogs and speckled vultures, flocks of crows

Most horrid, prey upon them. When I look,

Fear seizes on me. Tell me, MÄtali,

What wrong have these committed, charioteer,

Whom ravens prey on? MÄtali replied,

Describing how deeds ripen and bear fruit:


37. âThese are the churls, the misers, foul of tongue

To brahmins and ascetics, that do hurt;

These cruel creatures did do wrong, and they

Are those you see of ravens here the prey.â â 
{6.107}

38. âTheir bodies all ablaze they lie prostrate,

Pounded with red-hot lumps: when I behold,

Fear seizes on me. Tell me, MÄtali,

What wrongs have these committed, charioteer,

Who lie there beaten with the red-hot lumps?â


39. Then MÄtali the charioteer replied,

Describing how deeds ripen and bear fruit:


40. âThese in the world were men who did wrong,

Who hurt and did torment those without fault,

Both men and women, sinful as they were.

These cruel creatures did do, and they

Now lie there beaten with the red-hot lumps.â


41. âOthers lie struggling in a pit of coals,

Roaring, their bodies charred: when I behold, 
{6.108}

Fear seizes on me: tell me, MÄtali,

What wrong have these committed, charioteer,

Who lie there struggling in the fiery pit?â


42. Then MÄtali the charioteer replied,

Describing how deeds ripen and bear fruit:


43. âThese are they who before a crowd of men

Instigated a witness and forswore a debt;

And thus destroying people, mighty king,

These cruel creatures do wrong, and they

Lie there now struggling in the pit of coals.â 
[6.59]


44. âBlazing and flaming, all one mass of fire,

I see an iron cauldron, huge and great:

Fear comes upon me, as I look upon it.

MÄtali, tell me, charioteer divine â

What wrong these mortals did, that here head-first

Theyâre cast into the iron cauldron huge?â


45. Then answered MÄtali the charioteer,

Describing how deeds ripen and bear fruit:


46. âWhoso has hurt a brahmin or ascetic,

Foul men did wrong unto a virtuous man,

Those cruel creatures do wrong, and they

Now headlong fall into the iron bowl.â 
{6.109}


47. âThey wring them by the neck and cast them in,

Filling the cauldron full of boiling water!

Fear seizes on me: tell me, MÄtali,

What wrong has been committed by those mortals,

That with their heads all battered, there they lie?â


48. Then answered MÄtali the charioteer,

Describing how deeds ripen and bear fruit:


49. âThese are the wicked men who in the world

Caught birds, and did destroy them, mighty king;

And thus, destroying other creatures, they

By these their cruel acts gave rise to wrong,

And they lie yonder, with their own necks wrung.â


50-51. âThere flows a river, deep, with shallow banks,

Easy of access: there go the men,

Scorched with the heat, and drink: but as they drink,

The water turns to chaff; 
âAnd all blazes upâ: Commentator.
 which when I see,

Fear seizes on me. Tell me, MÄtali,

What wrong has been committed by those mortals,

That as they drink, the water turns to chaff?â 
{6.110}


52. Then answered MÄtali the charioteer,

Describing how deeds ripen and bear fruit:


53. âThese men are they who mixed good grain with chaff,

And sold it to a buyer, doing ill;

Therefore now scorched with heat and parched with thirst,

Even as they drink, the water turns to chaff.â


54. âWith spikes and spears and arrowheads they pierce

Those loudly-wailing folk on either side:

Fear seizes on me: tell me, MÄtali,

What wrong has been committed by those mortals,

That they lie yonder riddled with the spears?â


55. Then answered MÄtali the charioteer,

Describing how deeds ripen and bear fruit:


56. âThese in the world of life were wicked men

Who took what was not theirs, and lived upon it â

Goats, sheep, kine, bulls, corn, treasure, silver, gold:

These cruel creatures do wrong, and they

Now yonder lie all riddled with the spears.â 
{6.111}


57. âWho are these fastened by the neck I see,

Some cut to pieces, others all to-torn:

Fear seizes on me: tell me, MÄtali,

What wrong has been committed by those mortals,

That they lie yonder torn in little bits?â 
[6.60]


58. Then answered MÄtali the charioteer,

Describing how deeds ripen and bear fruit:


59. âFishermen and butchers, hunters of the boar,

Slayers of cattle, bulls, and goats, who slew

And laid the corpses in the slaughter-house,

These cruel creatures do wrong, and they

Are lying yonder torn in little bits.â


60. âThat lake of filth and ordure, stinking foul,

With evil scent unclean, where starving men

Eat of the contents! This when I behold,

Fear seizes on me: tell me, MÄtali,

What wrong has been committed by those mortals,

Whom there I see devouring dirt and filth?â


61. Then answered MÄtali the charioteer,

Describing how deeds ripen and bear fruit:


62. âThese are malicious persons, 
kÄraá¹ikÄ:
 â
kÄraá¹akÄrakÄ
.â The small St Petersburg Dictionary gives â
Lehrer
â as one meaning of it. There is nothing more to guide us. [The word means a torturer.]
 who, for hurt

Of others, lived with them, and harmed their friends: 
{6.112}

These cruel creatures do wrong, and now,

Poor fools, they have ordure and filth to eat.â


63. âThat lake is full of blood, and stinking foul,

With evil scent unclean, where scorched with heat

Men drink the contents, which when I behold,

Fear seizes on me; tell me, MÄtali,

What wrong has been committed by those mortals,

That they must now drink of the draught of blood?â


64. Then answered MÄtali the charioteer,

Describing how deeds ripen and bear fruit:


65. âThey who have slain a mother or a father,

Whom they should reverence; excommunicate

These cruel creatures do wrong, and they

Are those who yonder drink the draught of blood.â


66-67. âThat tongue see, pierced with a hook, like as a shield

Stuck with a hundred barbs; and who are those 
{6.113}

Who struggle leaping like a fish on land,

And roaring, drabble spittle? When I see it,

Fear seizes on me: tell me, MÄtali,

What wrong has been committed by those mortals,

Whom I see yonder swallowing the hook?â


68. Then answered MÄtali the charioteer,

Describing how deeds ripen and bear fruit:


69-70. âThese men are they who in the market-place

Haggling and cheapening from their greed of gain

Have practised cheating, and thought it hidden,

Like one that hooks a fish: but for the cheat

There is no safety, dogged by all his deeds:

These cruel creatures do wrong, and they

Are lying yonder swallowing the hook.â


71-72. âThose women, bent and broken, stretching their arms

And wailing, wretched, smeared with stains of blood,

Like cattle in the shambles, stand waist-deep

Buried in earth, the upper trunk ablaze! 
{6.114}

Fear seizes on me: tell me, MÄtali,

What wrong has been committed by those women,

That now they stand all buried in the earth

Waist-deep, the upper trunk a mass of flame?â 
[6.61]


73. Then answered MÄtali the charioteer,

Describing how deeds ripen and bear fruit:


74. âThey were of noble birth when in the world,

Lived lives unclean, did deeds of wickedness,

Were traitors, left their husbands, and besides

Did other things to satisfy their lust;

They spent their lives in dalliance; therefore now

Stand blazing, waist-deep buried in the earth.â


75. âWhy do they seize those persons by the legs

And cast them headlong into Naraka? 
âAn abyss full of blazing coalsâ: Commentator.

Fear seizes on me: tell me, MÄtali, 
{6.115}

What wrong has been committed by those men,

That they are so hurled headlong into Naraka?â


76. Then answered MÄtali the charioteer,

Describing how deeds ripen and bear fruit:


77-78. âThese in the world did evil, did seduce

Anotherâs wife, stole his most precious thing,

So now are headlong cast in Naraka.

They suffer misery for countless years

In hell; there is no safety for the wrongdoer,

But he is ever dogged by his own deeds.

These cruel creatures did wrong, and they

Are now cast headlong into Naraka.â

79. âMany and various causes I have seen

Most terrible, amongst these hells: to see them

Fear seizes on me: tell me, MÄtali,

What wrong has been committed by those mortals,

Why they must suffer this excessive pain,

So sharp, so cruel, so intolerable?â


80. Then answered MÄtali the charioteer,

Describing how deeds ripen and bear fruit:


81. âWho in the world were wicked heretics,

Who put their faith in false delusion,

Made proselytes of others to their heresy, 
{6.116}

They who by their heresy will do wrong

Must therefore suffer this excessive pain,

So sharp, so cruel, so intolerable.â

82. âNow, mighty monarch, you have seen the place

Of sinners, and where cruel men are sent,

And where the wicked go: now, royal sage,

Come let us hasten to the king of heaven.â

83-84. âBehold that mansion with five pinnacles:

There, decked with garlands, lies upon a couch

A most puissant woman, who assumes

All kinds of majesty and Super Powers.

Joy comes on me to see it, charioteer:

But tell me, MÄtali, what her good deeds,

That she is happy in this heavenly mansion.â


85. Then answered MÄtali the charioteer,

Describing how good ripens and bears fruit:


86. âHeard you ever in the world of BÄ«raá¹Ä«?

A brahminâs home-born slave, who once received

A guest at the right moment, welcomed him

As mother might her son; and therefore now,

Generous and chaste, lives happy in this mansion.â 
{6.118}

87-88. âThere are seven mansions, shining clear and bright,

Where dwells a mighty being, richly dight,

Who with his wives inhabits them. Delight

Moves me, to see it: tell me, MÄtali,

What is the good this mortal did, that he

Dwells happy in this mansion heavenly?â


89. Then answered MÄtali the charioteer,

Declaring how good ripens and bears fruit:


90-93. âThis once was Soá¹adinna, one who gave

With royal bounty, and for ascetics wrought

Seven hermitages: all their needs did crave

He faithfully provided. Food he brought,

Bedding to lie on, clothes to wear, and light,

Contented with those men of life upright,

He kept the sabbath day, and each fortnight:

The eighth, the fourteenth and the fifteenth days;

Generous, controlled, he walked in holy ways, 
[See Ja 489 
SurucijÄtaka
.]

So now dwells in this mansion of delight.â 
{6.119}

94-95. âThat mansion built of crystal, shining bright,

With pinnacles uplifted in the height,

With food and drink in plenty, and a throng

Of goodly women skilled in dance and song!

Joy seizes on me: tell me, MÄtali,

What good these women did, that now in heaven

They dwell within this palace of delight?â


96. Then answered MÄtali the charioteer,

Describing how good ripens and bears fruit:


97. âThese women ever walked in holy ways,

Faithful lay sisters, kept the holy days,

Generous, controlled, and watchful, heart-serene,

Now happy in the mansion you have seen.â

98-101. âThat mansion built of jewels, shining bright,

Symmetrical, proportioned, a fair sight,

Where in divinest melody around,

Songs, dances, drums and tabours do resound:

I never have beheld a sight so fair,

Nor sounds so sweet have ever heard, I swear!

Joy seizes on me: tell me, MÄtali,

What good these mortals did, that now I see

Happy in this heavenly mansion of delight?â


102. Then answered MÄtali the charioteer,

Describing how good ripens and bears fruit:


103-106. âThese were lay brethren in the world of men:

Provided parks and wells, or water drew.

In the well-shed, and tranquil saints did feed,

Found clothes, food, drink and bedding, every need,

Contented with these men of life upright,

Who kept the sabbath day, and each fortnight:

The eighth, the fourteenth and the fifteenth days;

Generous, controlled, they walked in holy ways,

And now dwell in this mansion of delight.â

107-110. âThat mansion built of crystal, shining bright,

Its pinnacles uplifted in the height, 
[6.64]

With food and drink in plenty, and a throng

Of goodly women skilled in dance and song,

And rivers, fringed with many a flower and tree â

Joy seizes on me: tell me, MÄtali,

What good this mortal did in life, that he

Rejoices in this mansion heavenly?â


111. Then answered MÄtali the charioteer,

Describing how good ripens and bears fruit:


112-114. âAt KimbilÄ a householder was he,

Bounteous, gave parks and wells, and faithfully

Drew water, and the tranquil saints did feed,

Found clothes, food, drink and bedding, every need,

Contented with these men of life upright,

He kept the sabbath day, and each fortnight:

The eighth, the fourteenth and the fifteenth days;

Generous, controlled, he walked in holy ways,

And now dwells in this mansion of delight.â

115-118. âThat mansion, built of jewels, shining bright,

Its pinnacles uplifted in the height,

With food and drink in plenty, and a throng 
{6.122}

Of goodly women skilled in dance and song,

And rivers, fringed with many a tree and flower,

Royal and elephant trees, and mango, SÄl,

Roseapple sweet, and tindook, piyal bower,

And orchard trees fruit-bearing one and all â

Joy seizes on me: tell me, MÄtali,

What good this mortal did in life, that he

Rejoices in this mansion heavenly?â


119. Then answered MÄtali the charioteer,

Describing how good ripens and bears fruit:


120-123. âAt MithilÄ a householder was he,

Bounteous, gave parks and wells, and faithfully

Drew water, and the tranquil saints did feed,

Found clothes, food, drink and bedding, all their need,

Contented with these men of life upright,

He kept the sabbath day, and each fortnight:

The eighth, the fourteenth and the fifteenth days;

Generous, controlled, he walked in holy ways,

And now dwells in this mansion of delight.â

124-125. âThat mansion built of jewels, shining bright,

Symmetrical, proportioned, a fair sight,

Where in divinest melody around,

Songs, dances, drums and tabours do resound:

I never have beheld a sight so fair,

Nor sounds so sweet have ever heard, I swear! 
[6.65] {6.123}

Joy seizes on me: tell me, MÄtali,

What good these mortals did, whom now I see

Happy in this heavenly mansion of delight?â


126. Then answered MÄtali the charioteer,

Describing how good ripens and bears fruit:


127-132. âOnce a Benares householder was he,

Bounteous, gave parks and wells, and faithfully

Drew water, and the tranquil saints did feed,

Found clothes, food, drink and bedding, all their need,

Contented with these men of life upright,

He kept the sabbath day, and each fortnight:

The eighth, the fourteenth and the fifteenth days;

Generous, controlled, he walked in holy ways,

And now dwells in this mansion of delight.â

133-134. âBehold that mansion made of flaming fire,

Red like the sun whereas he rises higher!

Joy seizes on me: tell me, MÄtali,

What good this mortal did in life, that he

Rejoices in this mansion heavenly?â


135. Then answered MÄtali the charioteer,

Describing how good ripens and bears fruit:


136-139. âOnce a SÄvatthi householder was he,

Bounteous, gave parks and wells, and faithfully

Drew water, and the tranquil saints did feed,

Found clothes, food, drink and bedding, all their need,

Contented with these men of life upright,

He kept the sabbath day, and each fortnight:

The eighth, the fourteenth and the fifteenth days;

Generous, controlled, he walked in holy ways,

And now dwells in this mansion of delight.â 
{6.124}

140-141. âSee many fiery mansions in the air,

As in a bank of cloud the lightningâs flare!

Joy seizes on me: tell me, MÄtali,

What good these mortals did, whom now I see

Rejoicing in the heavenly mansion there?â


142. Then answered MÄtali the charioteer,

Describing how good ripens and bears fruit:


143. âGood-living, well-instructed, full of faith,

They acted as the Teacherâs teaching saith;

By living as the Supreme Buddha told

They came to these abodes you now behold.â

144. âYouâve seen the places of the good and wicked in the air;

Unto the monarch of the gods come let us now repair.â 
[6.66] {6.125}

145. âAs the king journeyed on his way in the celestial car

Drawn by a thousand steeds, he saw the mountain peaks afar

In SÄ«dÄ ocean, and he asked, âTell me what hills these are.â â

146. âThe mighty hills Sudassara, KaravÄ«ka, Äªsadhara,

Yugandhara, Nemindhara, Vinataka, Assakaá¹á¹a.


147. These hills are in SÄ«dantara, in order there they be,

Which high-upstanding in the air you, mighty king, do see.â

148-149. âThis place so fine, elaborate, adorned,

Set round with Sakkaâs statues, as it were 
{6.126}

By tigers guarded â as I see this sight,

Joy comes upon me: tell me, MÄtali,

What is the name of this that I behold?â


150. Then answered MÄtali the charioteer,

Describing how good ripens and bears fruit:


151-152. âThis place is CittakÅ«á¹­a which you see,

The entrance to the place of heavenâs king,

The doorway of the Mountain Beautiful:

Elaborate, adorned, and set about

With Sakkaâs statues, as by tigers guarded.

Enter, wise king! Enter this spotless place.â

153. âJourneying in the car celestial,

Drawn by a thousand steeds, the mighty king

Beheld the place where all the gods assemble.â

154-155. âAs in the autumn is the sky all blue,

So is that jewelled mansion to the view.

Joy comes upon me: tell me, MÄtali,

What is this mansion which I now behold?â


156. Then answered MÄtali the charioteer,

Describing how good ripens and bears fruit: 
{6.127}


157-159. âThis is SudhammÄ, where the gods assemble,

Supported by fair columns, finely wrought,

Eight-sided, made of gems and jewels rare,

Where dwell the Three-and-Thirty, with their chief,

Lord Sakka, thinking of the happiness

Of gods and men: enter this lovely place,

O mighty monarch, where the gods abide!â

163. âThe gods beheld the king arrive: and then, their guest to greet,

Cried: âWelcome, mighty monarch, whom we are so glad to meet!

O king! Beside the king of gods we pray you take a seat.â


164. And Sakka welcomed Vedeha, the king of MithilÄ town,

Ay, VÄsava offered him all joys and prayed him to sit down.


165. Amid the rulers of the world O welcome to our land:

Dwell with the gods, O king! Who have all wishes at command,

Enjoy immortal pleasures, where the Three-and-Thirty stand.â

166. âAs when a chariot, or when goods are given on demand,

So is it to enjoy a bliss given by anotherâs hand. 
{6.128}


167. I care not blessings to receive given by anotherâs hand,

My goods are mine and mine alone when on my deeds I stand.


168. Iâll go and do much good to men, give alms throughout the land,

Will follow virtue, exercise control and self-command:

He that so acts is happy, and fears no remorse at hand.â

169. âA most obliging personage is MÄtali the charioteer,

The places where the good abide and where the bad, he showed me clear.â

167. âThus spake king Nimi, lord of MithilÄ,

And having made a mighty sacrifice,

Entered upon the path of self-control.â

When the Teacher had finished this discourse, he said: âSo, monks, this is not the first time the TathÄgata left the world; he did the same before.â Then he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time, Anuruddha was Sakka, Änanda was MÄtali, the eighty-four kings were the Buddhaâs followers, and king Nimi was I myself.â

In the present Devadatta arranges for an archer to kill the Buddha, and then for many more to kill the assassin to cover his tracks. The Buddha tells a story of a king who was convinced by his family priest that the way to heaven was to kill his sons, queens and advisors. After much vacillating on the part of the king Sakka intervenes and the princes are set free.

RÄhulamÄtÄ = (queen) CandÄ,

## Full Story
âIn PupphavatÄ« once there reigned.â
 The Teacher, while dwelling on the GijjhakÅ«á¹­a mountain, related this story concerning Devadatta. Its substance is contained in the section relating to the wrong of causing schisms in the Saá¹gha; it is to be fully known by studying the TathÄgataâs conduct from his first becoming an ascetic down to the murder of king BimbisÄra. As soon as he had caused him to be killed, Devadatta went to AjÄtasattu and said to him, âO king, your desire has attained its end, but mine has not yet attained it.â He replied, âWhat is your desire?â âI wish to have the One with Ten Powers killed and then myself become Buddha.â âWell, what have we to do?â âWe must collect some archers together.â The king assented and collected five hundred archers, all able to shoot as quick as lightning, and of these he chose out one-and-thirty 
{6.130}
 and sent them to wait on Devadatta, telling them to carry out his commands. He called the chief one amongst them and said to him, âMy friend, the ascetic Gotama lives on the GijjhakÅ«á¹­a mountain: at a certain time he walks up and down in his place of retirement during the day; do you go there and wound him with a poisoned arrow, and when you have killed him return here by such a road.â Then he sent two archers by that road, and said to them, âYou will meet a man coming by your road, kill him and return by such a road.â Then he sent four archers by that road with the same instructions, and after that similarly eight and sixteen. If you ask why he did this, he did it to conceal his own wickedness.


So this chief man among the archers bound his sword on his left side and his quiver on his back, and taking his bow made of a 
[6.69]
 ramâs horn went to the TathÄgata; but after he had strung his bow to wound him, and fixed the arrow, and pulled the string, he could not discharge it. His whole body became stiff as if it were crushed, and he stood terrified with the fear of death. When the Teacher saw him he spoke in a gentle voice, âFear not, come here.â He at once threw down his weapons and fell with his head on the Fortunate Oneâs feet, saying: âMy lord, wrong has overpowered me like a child or a fool or a sinner; I knew not your virtues, and I came here at the command of that blind dotard Devadatta, to take away your life: forgive me, I pray.â He gained his pardon and sat down on one side.


Then the Teacher revealed the Truths to him and caused him to attain Stream Entry. Then he told him to return by another road than that ordered by Devadatta; and himself came down from his covered walk and sat at the foot of a tree. As the first archer did not return, the two others came along the road to meet him, and wondered why he delayed so long, until at last they saw the One with Ten Powers, and went up to him, and after saluting him sat down on one side.


Then he revealed the Truths to them also and made them attain Stream Entry, and told them to return by another road than that ordered by Devadatta. In the same way, as the others came up and successively sat down, he established them also in Stream Entry and sent them away by another road.


Then the archer who first returned 
{6.131}
 went to Devadatta and said to him, âTeacher, I was not able to kill the Fully Awakened One, he is One of Super Powers, the majestic Fortunate One.â Thus they all recognised that they had saved their lives only through the Fully Awakened One, and they embraced the ascetic life under him, and became arhats.


This incident became known in the assembly of the Saá¹gha, and one day they began to talk of it in the Dhamma Hall, âMonks, have you heard how Devadatta, in his enmity against one person, the TathÄgata, has tried hard to deprive many people of their lives, and how they all saved their lives through the Teacher?â In came the Teacher and asked, âMonks, what are you talking of as you sit here?â and when they told him, âThis is not the first time,â said he, âhe tried before this to deprive many people of their lives in his enmity against me,â and he told them a story.

1. âIn PupphavatÄ« once there reigned a wicked king who in his need

Asked Khaá¹á¸ahÄla, his base priest, brahmin in name but not in deed:


2. âYou are a seer to whom, they say, all sacred learning has been given,

Tell me the road whose travellers rise by their good merits up to heaven.â â

3. âExceeding many gifts bestow, those who deserve not death destroy,

Thus men surpassing merit win and reach at last to heavenâs joy.â

4. âWhat are thâ exceeding many gifts? And who deserve not to be slain?

Iâll give the gifts, the victims slay, if you but make your meaning plain.â 
{6.133}

5. âYour sons, your queens must offered be, your merchant princes too must fall,

Your choicest bulls, your noblest steeds, yes the four kinds of victims all.â

6. âThe royal ladies heard the news: âPrinces and queens are doomed,â they cried,

And a wild cry of sudden fear rose up to heaven on every side.â 
[6.71]

7. âWarn Canda, Suriya 
The commentator adds that these were the sons of Queen GotamÄ, but perhaps Canda-Suriya is only one name; see afterwards. Two princes are especially mentioned and identified at the final summary.
 of my will, then Bhaddasena in his turn,

SÅ«ra and VÄmagotta next, they must all die: my will is stern.â

8. âUpaseá¹Ä« and KokilÄ, MuditÄ, NandÄ, each in turn,

Tell the princesses of their doom, they must all die: my will is stern.â

9. âTell VijayÄ, first of all my queens, SunandÄ, KesinÄ«, each in turn,

With all their beauty and their charms, they must all die: my will is stern.â 
{6.135}

10. âPuá¹á¹amukha and Bhaddiya, Siá¹gÄla, Vaddha, each in turn,

Bear to my merchants my command, they all must die: my will is stern.â

11. âThe merchants raised a bitter cry, surrounded by their sons and wives,

Leave but the topknot, shave our heads, make us your slaves, but spare our lives.â

12-13. âBring hither all my elephants, of matchless might, and costly price,

My best of horses and of mules, let them all be the sacrifice; 
{6.136}


14. My bulls the leaders of the herd, a noble offering they shall be;

And all the officiating priests shall have their gifts accordingly.


15-16. Make ready for the sacrifice against tomorrowâs dawning light;

And bid the princes feast their fill, enjoying now their lifeâs last night.â

17. âThe mother left her royal home: âMy son, what means this monstrous thing?

Must your four sons be put to death to swell your cruel offering?â â

18. âWhen I lose Canda I lose all; but him and them will I resign,

For by this costly sacrifice a heavenly dwelling will be mine.â

19. âTo sacrifice your sons, my child, can never lead to heavenâs bliss;

Give ear to no such lying words; the road to hell and night is this. 
{6.137}


20. Take you the well-proved royal road: let all your wealth in alms be given,

And hurt no living thing on earth â this is the certain path to heaven.â

21. âI must obey my teacherâs words, my sons, alas, must all be slain,

âTis hard indeed to part with them, but heavenâs the prize which I shall gain.â 
[6.73]

22. âThe father Vasavatti came: âStrange tidings fill my soul with fright!

Must your four sons be put to death to crown to the full your monstrous rite?â â

27. âGive all you can and never harm a living thing of thine own will;

And with your sons as body-guard shield you your land from every ill.â

28. âLet us be Khaá¹á¸ahÄlaâs slaves, but spare our lives and do not kill,

His horses and his elephants weâll watch in chains, if such his will.


29-30. Let us be Khaá¹á¸ahÄlaâs slaves, but spare our lives and do not kill,

Weâll sweep his stables and his yards, and work in chains, if such his will.


31. Give us as slaves to whom you will, we are as bondsmen in your hands;

Or banish us from your domains to beg our bread in foreign lands.â

32. âThese piteous pleadings for their lives do break my heart, go set them free,

Release the princes, let them go: no more of sacrifice for me.â

33. âI warned you that this sacrifice would prove a hard and toilsome one;

Why interfere to stop the rite when it is all so well begun?


34. They who give offerings such as these go by a certain road to heaven;

Or those who heartily approve, seeing the same by others given.â

35. âWhy did the brahmin at our birth utter vain blessings on our path,

When âtwas our fate that we should die innocent victims of your wrath?


36. Why did you spare us while still babes, too young as yet to feel the blow?

We are to die today instead, now that the joys of youth we know.


37. Think of us riding clothed in mail on horse or elephant to the fight,

And then as victims butchered here in sacrifice â can this be right?


38. In battle âgainst a rebel chief or in a forest such as I

Are wont to serve: whom now you slay without a cause or reason why.
 [6.74]


39. See the wild birds who build their nests and sing amidst the trees all day,

They love their young and tend them well â and you, would you your children slay? 
{6.140}


40. Nor think your treacherous brahmin friend will spare your life when I am gone;

Your turn, O king, will follow next: I shall not perish all alone.


41. Kings give these brahmins villages, choice cities are their appanage,

On every family they feed and gain a goodly heritage;


42. And âtis these benefactors, sire, whom they most readily betray;

The brahmin order, take my word, are faithless and ingrate alway. 
[I include verses that were omitted here.]
 {6.141}

47. âThese piteous pleadings for their lives do break my heart, go set them free,

Release the princes and the rest, no more of sacrifice for me.â

50. âIf they who sacrifice their sons are, when they die, all glorified,

Then let the brahmin offer his: the king shall follow him as guide.


51-52. If they who sacrifice their sons go straight to heaven when they die,

Why does the brahmin offer not himself and all his family?


53. Nay rather, they who offer up such victims all shall go to hell,

And those who dare to approve the deed shall perish at the last as well.â

54-55. âHow can the fathers, mothers, here stand silent, looking on, and none,

Loving their children as they do, forbid the king to slay his son?


56. I love the welfare of the king, I love to see your hearts rejoice,

And is there none among you found to utter one protesting voice?â

57. âGo, noble ladies, with your prayers, implore the king, implore his priest,

To spare these guiltless sons of his, well-proved in battleâs sternest test;


58. Implore the king, implore the priest, to spare these sons unstained by crime,

Whose names are blazoned through the world, the glory of their land and time.â

59. âO had I but been born from courts aloof,

Under some cobblerâs, sweeperâs, outcasteâs roof,

I should have lived my days to the end in peace,

Nor died a victim to a kingâs caprice.â

60-61. âGo, all you women in a band, low before Khaá¹á¸ahÄla fall,

And tell him you have wronged him not, that you are guiltless one and all.â 
[6.75] {6.143}

62. âLoudly wails SelÄ when she sees her brothers sentenced by the king,

My father longs for heaven, they say, and this forsooth his offering.â

63. âThen VÄsula with uncertain steps went this way, that way to the throne,

O spare our father, children we, leave us not helpless and alone.â

64. âHere is your father, VÄsula; your words oâerpower me, he is free;

Release the princes, let them go, no more of sacrifice for me.â

67. âThe sacrifice has been prepared, the costliest treasures have been given:

Go forth, O king, to offer it, and claim the choicest joys of heaven.â

68. âPrince Candaâs seven hundred queens, radiant in all their youthful bloom,

With hair dishevelled, weeping eyes, followed the hero to his doom;


69. And other ladies joined the train like beings from heavenâs firmament,

With hair dishevelled, weeping eyes, following the hero as he went.â

70. âWith earrings, aloes, sandalwood, in KÄsÄ« silk of costly price,

See Canda, Suriya 
It is curious to observe that the prose throughout has only one prince, but the verses seem to have two.
 yonder led as victims to the sacrifice.


71-72. Piercing their motherâs heart with woe, filling the citizens with gloom,

See Canda, Suriya yonder led as victims to their cruel doom.


73. Bathed and perfumed with richest scents and with white robes of KÄsÄ« dressed,

See Canda, Suriya yonder led as victims at the kingâs behest.
 {6.145}


74. They who once rode on elephants, a gallant sight for every eye,

Our Canda, Suriya yonder see, toiling along on foot to die.


75-77. They who in chariots wont to ride, or mules, or horses gold-bedight,

Our Canda, Suriya yonder see, toiling on foot to die ere night.â
 [6.76]

78-85. âBirds, would you feast on flesh? Then fly to PupphavatÄ«âs eastern gate,

There the mad king is offering up his four brave sons in blinded hate.

Birds, would you feast on flesh? Then fly to PupphavatÄ«âs eastern gate,

There the mad king is offering up four daughters in his blinded hate.â 
Six verses are omitted here about the four queens, householders, elephants, horses, bulls, and the complete sacrifice of four kinds of victims. 
 {6.146}

101. âVillages uninhabited turn to a forest solitude;

So will our capital lie waste, if once our princes shed their blood.â 
{6.148}

102-103. âI shall go crazy in my grief, covered with dust, undone, forlorn,

If my son Canda 
This verse is repeated with the name Suriya instead of Canda.
 has to die, my breath will choke me as I mourn.â

104. âWhy do you not talk lovingly each to the other as you stand,

And dance around him cheerfully, clasping each other hand in hand,

Until his melancholy flies and leaves him cured at your command,

For who can dance, indeed, like you, although they search through all the land?â

105-112. âNow may your mother, cruel priest, feel all the bitter agony

Which tears my heart when I behold my precious Canda led to die. 
[6.77] {6.149}

Now may your wife, O cruel priest, feel all the bitter agony

Which tears my soul when I behold my precious Suriya led to die;

May she see sons and husband slain, for you, O cruel priest, today

The pride and glory of the world, those guiltless lion-hearts would slay.â

117. Some women long and beg for sons and offer prayers and gifts to heaven,

They long for sons and grandsons too, but none to cheer their homes are given;


118. O slay us not thus recklessly, though given in answer unto prayer,

Nor offer us a sacrifice in spite of all our motherâs care.â

121-124. âTenderly have you nursed your son, hard is the lot which falls to you;

I bow before your sacred feet: all blessings on my father be.

Give me your feet to kiss once more, embrace me, mother, ere we part,

âTis a long journey which I go, a bitter sorrow to your heart.â
 {6.151}

125. âBind on your head, my darling son, a diadem of lotus leaves,

With CampÄk flowers, such coronal your manly beauty well receives.


126. For the last time anoint thyself with all those unguents rich and rare

Which in old days before the king in court festivities you did wear.


127-128. For the last time put on, my boy, bright KÄsi silk in fine array,

And wear the jewels and the pearls which you should wear on gala day.â

129. âThis lord of lands, this sovereign king, whose will in all his realm is done,

Sole heir of all his countryâs wealth, has no affection for his son.â

130. âMy sons are dear, myself is dear, and you, my queens, are dear as well;

I sacrifice my son, because I wish to go to heaven, not hell.â 
{6.152}

131. âO king, in mercy slay me first, nor let the anguish rend my heart,

Your boy is garlanded for both, he is complete in every part.


132. Slay us together on the pile, and let me go where Canda goes:

Infinite merit will be thine, two souls will rise to heavenâs repose.â

133. âWish not for death before its time; gallant brothers-in-law have you;

They will console you, large-eyed one, for the dear prince you losest now.â

135. âNo friends or counsellors surround this king,

Who dare to warn him not to do this thing, 
[6.78]


136. He has no faithful ministers, not one,

Who dares persuade him not to slay his son. 
{6.153}


137. His other sons wear all their bravery,

Let them be offered and set Canda free.


138-139. Cut me in pieces, offer me, but spare my eldest son, my knight,

Him whom the world does reverence, the lion-hearted in the fight.â

140. âO CandÄ, during my lifetime many various pearls and gems have been given by me to you in times of social unbending; now today I give you this last ornament from my body; pray accept it.â

141-142. âHis shoulders once were bright with flowers, which hung down as his diadem,

Today the cruel sharp bright sword spreads its dark shadow over them.


143. Soon will the sword come sweeping down upon that guiltless royal neck,

Ah! Iron bands must bind my heart, or else what could it do but break? 
{6.154}


144-149. With aloes and with sandal decked, wearing rich silks and many a ring,

Go, Canda-Suriya, to the pile, befitting offering for the king.

With aloes and with sandalwood, with silken robes and gems of price,

Go, Canda-Suriya, to the pile, the great kingâs worthy sacrifice.

Bathed for the offering, waiting there in silk and gems the impending blow,

Go, Canda-Suriya, to the pile, filling the peopleâs hearts with woe.â

150. âWhen all is ready for the rite and Canda sits and waits the blow,

The daughter of the PaÃ±cÄl king went through the assembly, high and low:


151. âAs truly as the brahmin here works a vile purpose by his guile,

So may I gain my dear-loved lord restored me in a little while.


152. May all the Beings in this place â BhÅ«tas and Yakkhas, â hear my word,

Do my commission loyally and reunite me to my lord.
 {6.155}


153. Oh DevatÄ who fill this place, lo! prostrate at your feet I fall,

Protect me in my helplessness, hear me in mercy as I call.â â
 [6.79]

154. âAn Amanussa having heard, he came to earth to help the right,

Whirling a blazing iron mass, filling the tyrantâs heart with fright:


155. âKnow me, O tyrant, who I am; mark well the weapon which I wield,

Harm not your guiltless eldest son, the lion of the battlefield.


156. Where has earth seen a crime like this, your sons, their wives, to slaughter given,

With all your noblest citizens, worthy to fill my highest heaven?â


157-158. The tyrant and his minister then set the guiltless victims free,

And all the crowd seized sticks and stones, and in a fit of frenzied glee

Made Khaá¹á¸ahÄla there and then pay forfeit for his cruelty.â
 {6.156}

159. âAll who had done so vile a deed passed straight to hell, none could attain

An afterbirth in any heaven, who bore the trace of such a stain.â

160-168. âWhen all the captives were released, a vast assembly gathering

With solemn pomp and festival anointed Canda to be king;

A vast assembly, gods and men, waved cloths and flags and sang his praise,

Starting a new and happy reign of plenty, peace and halcyon days.

Humans, Devas, DevakaÃ±Ã±Äs joined in one great festivity,

Comfort and peace filled every home and every captive was set free.â
 {6.157}

When the Teacher had ended his discourse, he added, âMonks, this is not the first time that Devadatta has sought to kill many persons on my sole account; he did the same before.â Then he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time Devadatta was Khaá¹á¸ahÄla, MahÄmÄyÄ was queen GotamÄ, RÄhulaâs mother was CandÄ, RÄhula was VÄsula, Uppalavaá¹á¹Ä was SelÄ, Kassapa of the VÄma family was SÅ«ra, MoggallÄna was Candasena, SÄriputta was prince Suriya and I myself was CandarÄja.â

## Analysis
In the present some laymen keep the Uposatha precepts. The Buddha tells of a NÄga who kept the precepts even though he was captured and humiliated by a brahmin hunter. When later the greatness of brahmins is praised, he shows how they hold to a false doctrine and teaches the truth.

## Full Story
âWhatever jewels there may be.â
 This story the Teacher told, while dwelling at SÄvatthi, about some laymen who kept the Uposatha precepts. On the Uposatha, it is said, they rose early in the morning, took upon them the Uposatha precepts, gave alms, and after their meal took perfumes and garlands in their hands and went to Jetavana, and at the time of hearing the Dhamma seated themselves on one side. The Teacher, coming to the Dhamma Hall, having sat down in the adorned Buddha-seat, looked upon the assembly of the monks. 
{6.158}
 Now the TathÄgatas like to converse with those among the monks or others, in reference to whom a Dhamma discourse takes its rise; therefore on the present occasion, as he knew that a Dhamma discourse concerning former teachers would arise in connection with these laymen, while he was conversing with them, he asked them, âO laymen, do you keep the Uposatha?â On their replying in the affirmative, he said: âIt is right and well done of you, O laymen; but yet it is no matter for wonder that you who have a Buddha like me for teacher should keep the Uposatha, sages of old who were without any teacher forsook great glory and kept the Uposatha.â And so saying, he told at their request a story of the past.

1. âWhatever jewels there may be in Dhataraá¹­á¹­haâs palace stored,

They all are yours, his royal boon; give us your daughter for our lord.â

2. âNeâer has a man been known to wed his daughter to a NÄga king;

Such match were utterly unfit, how could we think of such a thing?â

3. âYou sacrifice your life, O king, your throne and kingdom what are they?

Before a NÄga in his wrath all mortal glory fades away;


4. You a poor mortal standing there, who, by your vanity undone,

Would look with scorn on Yamuna, king Varuá¹aâs imperial son.â 
Varuá¹a is called a NÄgarÄja in 
Lalitavistara
, p. 249, 13. These lines seem to be a quotation from another poem.

5. âI do not scorn that king of yours, Dhataraá¹­á¹­ha of wide renown,

Of many NÄgas is he king, he wears by right a royal crown;


6. But great and noble though he be, sprung from Videhaâs khattiya line,

My daughter is of purer blood, let him not dream of child of mine.â

7. âAssataras and Kambalas, 
Names of NÄga tribes.
 summon the NÄgas one and all;

Towards Benares let them flock, but do no harm to great or small.â

8. âOver the tanks and palaces, the public roads and tops of trees,

Over the gateways woven in wreaths let them hang dangling in the breeze;


9. While with white body and white hoods I will the city all invest,

And drawing close my lines of siege with terror fill each KÄsi breast.â

10-11. âSeeing the snakes on every side, the women throng, a trembling crowd,

And as the monsters swell their hoods in fear they shriek and wail aloud;


12-13. Benares city prostrate lay before these wild invading bands,

Raising their arms all begged and prayed: âGive him the daughter he demands.â â

14. âWhat youth is this, red-eyed, who here is seen,

His shoulders broad with ample space between,

And what ten maidens these who guard him round

Clad in fair robes, with golden bracelets bound!


15. Who are you âmidst this forest greenery,

Bright like a fire just newly dressed with ghee?

Are you a Sakka or a Yakkha, say,

Or some famed NÄga prince of potent sway?â

16. âI am a NÄga great in Powers, invincible with poisonous breath,

A prosperous land with all its sons my angry bite could smite with death;


17. My mother is SamuddajÄ, Dhataraá¹­á¹­ha as sire I claim,

Sudassanaâs young brother I, and BhÅ«ridatta is my name.â

18. âAwful and dark is yonder lake, incessant storms its waters toss,

That is my home: my subjects there all hear and none my bidding cross;


19. Plunge you beneath the dark blue waves, the peacocks and the herons call,

Plunge and enjoy the bliss there stored for those who keep the precepts all.â

20. âFear not, O brahmin with your son, follow my words and you shall live

Honoured and happy in my home with all the pleasures I can give.â

21. âLevel the ground on every side, with tagara blossoms whitened oâer,

Red with the cochineal insect-swarms, the brightest verdure for its floor,


22. With sacred shrines in every wood, and swan-filled lakes which charm the eye,

While strewn the fallen lotus leaves as carpets on the surface lie,


23. The thousand-columned palaces with halls where heavenly maidens dance,

Their columns all of jewels wrought, whose angles in the sunshine glance; 
{6.174}


24. You have indeed a glorious home, won by your merits as thine own,

When all desires are gratified as soon as each new wish is known;


25. You envy not the great Sakkaâs halls, what are his stateliest courts to thine?

Your palaces more glorious are and with more dazzling splendours shine.â
 [6.91]

26. âOur highest thoughts cannot conceive the imperial pomp round Sakkaâs throne,

Or the four Regents 
The four 
lokapÄlas
.
 in his court, each in his own appointed zone.â

27. âI long intensely for the home of the immortal saints on high,

Therefore upon that ant-hill top I keep the fast unceasingly.â 
{6.175}

28. âI too sought deer when with my son into that forest glade I sped;

The friends I left at home know not whether I am alive or dead;


29. O BhÅ«ridatta, let us go, you glorious lord of KÄsi race,

Let us depart and see once more our kindred in their native place.â

30. â âTis my desire that you should dwell with us, and here pass happy hours;

Where in the upper world of men will you find haunts of peace like ours?


31. But would you dwell awhile elsewhere and yet enjoy our pleasures still,

Then take my leave, go, see your friends, and be as happy as you will.â

32. âThe bearer of this heavenly gem beholds his children and his farm;

Take it, O brahmin, and begone, its bearer never comes to harm.â

33. âI understand your words too well, I am grown old as you can see,

I will adopt the ascetic life, what are lifeâs pleasures now to me?â

34. âIf you should fail and break your vow then seek lifeâs common joys once more,

And come and find me out again and I will give you ample store.â 
{6.176}

35. âO BhÅ«ridatta, I accept with thanks the offer you have made;

Should the occasion come to me I will return to claim your aid.â 
[6.92]

36. âThen BhÅ«ridatta gave commands to four of his young NÄgas, âGo,

Take you this brahmin in your charge and lead him where he wants to go.â


37. The four attendants heard the words, at once their lordâs command was done:

They brought the brahmin to the place and leaving him returned alone.â

38. âWhere did you get that gem of yours, bringing good luck and fair to thâ eye;

But having certain signs and marks, which I can recognise it by?â 
{6.180}

39. âThis morning as I walked along I saw the jewel where it lay,

Its thousand red-eyed guards all fled and left it there to be my prey.â

40. âCarefully tended, honoured well, and worn or stowed away with care,

It brings its owner all good things, however large his wishes are;


41. But if he shows it disrespect and wears or stows it heedlessly,

Sore will he rue the finding it, âtwill only bring him misery.


42. Do you have nought to do therewith, you have no skill such ware to hold:

Give it to me and take instead a hundred pounds of yellow gold.â

43. âI will not sell this gem of mine, though cows or jewels offered be;

Its signs and marks I know full well, and it shall neâer be bought from me.â 
{6.181}

44. âIf cows or jewels will not buy from you that jewel which you wear,

What is the price youâll sell it for? Come, a true answer let me hear.â

45. âHe who can tell me where to find the mighty NÄga in his pride,

To him this jewel will I give, flashing its rays on every side.â

46.â Is this perchance the Garuá¸·a king, come in brahminâs guise today,

Seeking, while on the track for food, to seize the NÄga as his prey?â

47. âNo bird-king I, a Garuá¸·a neâer came across these eyes of mine,

I am a brahmin doctor, friend, and snakes and snake-bites are my line.â

48. âWhat special power do you possess, or have you learned some subtle skill

Which gives you this immunity to handle snakes whose fangs can kill?â

49. âThe ascetic Kosiya in the wood kept a long painful penance well,

And at the end a Garuá¸·a revealed to him the serpent-spell.


50. That holiest sage, who dwelt retired upon a lonely mountain height,

I waited on with earnest zeal and served unwearied day and night;


51. And at the last to recompense my years of faithful ministry

My blessed teacher did reveal the heavenly secret unto me.
 {6.182}


52. Trusting in this all-powerful spell, the fiercest snakes I do not fear;

I counteract their deadliest bites, I, ÄlambÄyana the seer.â 
[6.96]

53. âLet us secure this gem, my son; come, Somadatta, letâs be quick,

Nor lose our luck as did the fool 
cf. 
HitopadeÅa
 iv., story 8.
 who smashed his meal-dish with his stick.â

54. âAll honour due he showed to you, when you came in that strangerâs way;

And would you turn and rob him now, his kindly welcome to repay?


55. If you want wealth, go seek for it from BhÅ«ridatta as before;

Ask him and he will gladly give all that your heart desires, and more.â

56. âThat which, by lucky fortune brought, in bowl or hand all ready lies,

Eat it at once nor questions ask, lest you should lose the offered prize.â

57. âEarth yawns for him, hellâs fiercest fires await the traitor at the end,

Or, with fell hunger gnawed, he pines a living death, who cheats his friend.


58. Ask BhÅ«ridatta, he will give, if you want wealth, the wished-for boon;

But if you do wrong, I fear that the wrong will find you out right soon.â

59. âBut, through a sacrifice brahmins may do wrong and yet be made clean;

Great sacrifices we will bring and, so made pure, escape the wrong.â

60. âCease your vile talk, I will not stay, this very moment I depart,

I will not go one step with you, this baseness rankling in your heart.â

61. âThe noble Somadatta thus rebuked his father where he stood,

Startling the BhÅ«tas of the place, and turned and hurried from the wood.â

62. âSeize this NÄga-king where he lies and snatch forthwith that priceless gem,

Which bright-red like a lady-bird glows on his head a diadem.


63. On yonder ant-heap see! He lies, stretched out without a thought of fear,

Spread like a heap of cotton there, seize him before he knows youâre near.â

64. âBy dint of drugs of magic power and muttering spells with evil skill,

He seized and held him without fear and made him subject to his will.â

65. âYou see me come with all success, my every wish has hit the mark;

And yet you show no signs of joy, and your whole countenance is dark,


66. Dark as a lotus rudely plucked which droops and withers in the hand;

Is this the welcome which you give when I come back from foreign land?â

67. âHas anyone upbraided you or are you racked with secret pain,

That thus your countenance is dark, eâen when you see me back again?â

68. âI saw an evil dream, my son, a month ago this very day; 
{6.188}

There came a man who lopped my arm as on my bed I sleeping lay,

And carried off the bleeding limb, no tears of mine his hand could stay.


69. Blank terror overpowers my heart, and since I saw that cruel sight

A momentâs peace or happiness I have not known by day or night.â
 [6.100]

70. âHe whom fair maidens in their bloom used to be proud to wait upon,

Their hair adorned with golden nets, BhÅ«ridatta, alas, is gone;


71. He whom stout soldiers used to guard, with their drawn swords, a gallant train,

Flashing like kaá¹ikÄra flowers, alas, I look for him in vain!


72. I must pursue your brotherâs track and find where he has fixed to dwell,

Fulfilling his ascetic vow, and learn myself if all be well.â

73. âThe wives of BhÅ«ridatta there beheld his mother drawing nigh,

And putting out their arms they wept with an exceeding bitter cry;


74. BhÅ«ridatta, your son, went hence a month ago, we know not where;

Whether he be alive or dead we cannot tell in our despair.â
 {6.189}

75-79. âLike a lone bird whose brood is slain, when it beholds its empty nest,

So sorrow, when I look in vain for BhÅ«ridatta, fills my breast.

Deep in my heart my grief for him burns with a fierce and steady glow

Just like the furnace which a smith carries whereâer he is called to go.â

80. âLike SÄl trees prostrate in a storm, their branches broken, roots uptorn,

So mother, wives, and children, lay in that lone dwelling-place forlorn.â

81. âAriá¹­á¹­ha then and Subhaga, eager to help and comfort, come,

Hearing the sounds of wild lament which rose in BhÅ«ridattaâs home;


82. âMother, be calm, your wailings end, this is the lot of all who live;

They all must pass from birth to birth: change rules in all things, do not grieve.â â
 [6.101] {6.190}

83. âMy son, I know it but too well, this is the lot of all who live,

But now no common loss is mine, left thus forlorn I can but grieve;


84. Verily if I see him not, my jewel and my soulâs delight,

My BhÅ«ridatta, I will end my wretched life this very night.â

85. âMourn not, dear mother, still your grief, weâll bring our brother back;

Through the wide earth on every side we will pursue his track


86. Oâer hill and dale, through village, town and city, till heâs found,

Within ten days we promise you to bring him safe and sound.â

87. âIt slipped out of my hand and seized your foot with all its might;

Did it chance bite you? Never fear, thereâs no harm in its bite.â

88. âThis snake of yours can harm me not,

I am a match for him, I wot;

Search where you will, you will not see

One who can charm a snake like me.â

89. âThis lout dressed out in brahmin guise challenges me today,

Let all the assembly hear my words and give us both fair play.â

90. âA frog shall be my champion, and let a snake be yours,

Five thousand pieces be the stake, and let us show our powers.â

91. âI am a man well-backed with means, and you a bankrupt clown;

Who will stand surety on your side, and whereâs the money down?


92. There is my surety, thereâs the stake in case I lose the bet;

Five thousand coins will show my powers, your challenge, see, is met.â
 {6.193}

93. âO noble monarch, hear my words, neâer may good luck your steps forsake;

Will you be surety in my name? Five thousand pieces is the stake.â

94. âIs it some debt your father left or is it all your own,

That you should come and ask from me such an unheard-of loan?â

95. âÄlambÄna would beat me with his snake;

I with my frog his brahmin pride will break.


96. Come forth, O king, with all your train appear,

And see the beating which awaits him here.â

97. âI do not want to humble you, I will not boast at all;

But you despise this snake too much, your pride may have a fall.â 
{6.194}

98. âI do not seek to humble you, a brahmin, or despise your skill;

But wherefore thus cajole the crowd with harmless snakes that cannot kill?


99. If people knew your real worth as well as I can see it plain,

Why talk of gold? A little meal would be the limit of your gain.â

100. âYou mendicant in assâs skin, uncombed and squalid to the sight,

You dare to scorn this snake of mine, and say forsooth it cannot bite;


101. Come near and try what it can do, learn by experience if you must;

I warrant you its harmless bite will make of you a heap of dust.â

102. âA rat or water-snake perchance may bite

And leave its poison if you anger it;

But your red-headed snake is harmless quite,

It will not bite, however much it spit.â

103. âI have been told by holy saints who practised penance ceaselessly,

Those who in this life give their alms will go to heaven when they die;


104. I counsel you to give at once if you have anything to give,

This snake will turn you into dust, you have but little time to live.â

105. âI too have heard from holy saints, those who give alms will go to heaven;

Give you your alms while yet you may, if you have anything that can be given. 
[6.104] {6.195}


106-107. This is no common snake of mine, sheâll make you lower your boastful tone;

A daughter of the NÄga king, and a half-sister of my own,

AccimukhÄ«, her mouth shoots flames; her poisonâs of the deadliest known.â

108. âIf I should drop it on the ground, listen, O king, to me,

The grass and creeping plants and herbs would parched and blasted be.â

109. âIf I should do your hest, O king, and throw it in the sky,

No rain nor snow will fall from heaven till seven long years roll by.â

110. âIf in the water it were dropped, listen, O king, to me,

Fishes and turtles would die and all that lives in sea.â

111. âIâm bathing at this sacred spot here in PayÄgaâs holy flood;

My limbs are wet with sacred drops, what cruel Yakkha seeks my blood?â

112. âHe who, men say, in ancient days to this proud KÄsi wrathful came,

And wrapped it round with his strong coils, that NÄga king of glorious fame,

His son am I, who hold you now: Subhaga, brahmin, is my name.â

113. âScion of KÄsiâs 
The text reads 
Kaá¹sassa,
 âAnother name for the king of KÄsiâ (Commentator).
 royal race divine,

Your mother born from that illustrious line,

You would not leave the meanest brahminâs slave

To perish drowned beneath the ruthless wave.â 
{6.199}

114. âA thirsty deer approached to drink â from your tree-porch your shaft flew down:

In fear and pain your victim fled, spurred by an impulse not its own;


115. Deep in the wood you saw it fall and bore it on your carrying-pole

To where a banyanâs shoots grew thick, clustering around the parent bole;


116. The parrots sported in the boughs, the kokilâs song melodious rose,

Green spread the grassy sward below, evening invited to repose;


117. But there your cruel eye perceived my brother, who the boughs among

In summer pomp of colour dressed sported with his attendant throng.


118-119. He in his joyance harmed you not, but you in malice did him slay,

An innocent victim, lo that crime comes back on your own head today,

I will not spare your life an hour, my utmost vengeance you shall pay.â

120. âStudy, the offering of prayers, libations in the sacred fire,

These three things make a brahminâs life inviolate to mortalâs ire.â 
{6.200}

121. âBeneath the YamunÄâs sacred stream, stretching to far HimÄlayaâs feet,

Lies deep the NÄga capital where Dhataraá¹­á¹­ha holds his seat;


122. There all my hero brothers dwell, to them will I refer your plea,

And as their judgment shall decide, so shall your final sentence be.â

123. âThe Veda and the sacrifice, things of high worth and dignity,

Belong to brahmins as their right, however worthless they may be;

Great honour is their privilege and he who flouts them in his scorn,

Loses his wealth, breaks the Dhamma, and lives guilt-burdened and forlorn.â
 {6.201}

124. âBrahmins he made for study; for command

He made the Khattiyas; Vessas plough the land;

Suddas he servants made to obey the rest;

Thus from the first went forth the Lordâs behest.â

125. âKuvera, Soma, Varuá¹a, of old,

DhÄtÄ, VidhÄtÄ, and the Sun and Moon,

Offered their sacrifices manifold,

And to their brahmin priests gave every boon. 
[6.108]


126. The giant Ajjuna who wrought such woe,

Round whose huge bulk a thousand arms once grew,

Each several pair with its own threatening bow,

Heaped on the sacred flame the offerings due.â 
{6.202}

127. âThat ancient king who feasted them so well

Became at last a god, old stories tell.


128. King Mujalinda long the fire adored,

Glutting its thirst with all the ghee he poured;

And at the last the earned reward it brought,

He found the pathway to the heaven he sought.â

129. DujÄ«pa lived a thousand years in all,

Chariots and hosts unnumbered at his call;

But an asceticâs life was his at last,

And from his hermitage to heaven he past.


130. SÄgara all the earth in triumph crossed,

And raised a golden sacrificial post;

None worshipped fire more zealously than he,

And he too rose to be a deity.


131. The milk and curds which Aá¹ga, KÄsiâs lord,

In his long offerings so profusely poured,

Swelled Gaá¹gÄ to an ocean by their flood,

Until at last in Sakkaâs courts he stood.


132. Great Sakkaâs general on the heavenly plain,

By soma-offerings did the honour gain;
 {6.204}

He who now marshals the immortal powers

Rose from a mortal sin-stained lot like ours.


133-134. Brahma the great creator, he who made

The mountains landmarks in his altar yard,

Whose hest the Ganges in its path obeyed,

By sacrifice attained his great reward.

135. âA ascetic student, versed in prayer and spell,

Once stood upon the shore, as Iâve heard tell; 
{6.205}

He touched the sea, it forthwith swallowed him,

And since that day has been undrinkable.â

136. âWhen Sakka first attained his royal throne,

His special favour upon brahmins shone;

East, west, north, south, they made their ritual known,

And found at last a Veda of their own.â

137. âThese Veda studies are the wise manâs toils,

The lure which tempts the victims whom he spoils;

A mirage formed to catch the careless eye,

But which the prudent passes safely by.


138. The Vedas have no hidden power to save

The traitor or the coward or the cheat;

The fire, though tended well for long years past,

Leaves his base master without hope at last.


139. Though all earthâs trees in one vast heap were piled

To satisfy the fireâs insatiate child,

Still would it crave for more, insatiate still,

How could a NÄga hope that maw to fill?


140. Milk ever changes, thus where milk has been

Butter and curds in natural course are seen;

And the same thirst for change pervades the fire,

Once stirred to life it mounts still higher and higher.


141-142. Fire bursts not forth in wood thatâs dry or new,

Fire needs an effort ere it leaps to view;

If dry fresh timber of itself could burn,

Spontaneous would each forest blaze in turn.


143. If he wins merit who to feed the flame

Piles wood and straw, the merit is the same

When cooks light fires or blacksmiths at their trade,

Or those who burn the corpses of the dead.
 {6.207}


144. But none, however zealously he prays,

Or heaps the fuel round to feed the blaze,

Gains any merit by his mummeries,

The fire for all its crest of smoke soon dies.


145. Were fire the honoured being that you think,

Would it thus dwell with refuse and with stink,

Feeding on carrion with a foul delight,

Where men in horror hasten from the sight?


146. Some worship as a god the crested flame,

Barbarians give to water that high name;

But both alike have wandered from their road:

Neither is worthy to be called a god.
 [6.110]


147. To worship fire, the common drudge of all,

Senseless and blind and deaf to every call,

And then oneâs self to live a life of sin,

How could one dream that this a heaven could win?


148. These brahmins all a livelihood require,

And so they tell us Brahma worships fire;

Why should the uncreate who all things planned

Worship himself the creature of his hand?


149. Doctrines and rules of their own, absurd and vain,

Our sires imagined wealth and power to gain;


150. Brahmins he made for study, for command

He made the Khattiyas; Vessas plough the land;

Suddas he servants made to obey the rest;

Thus from the first went forth his high behest. 
See p. 106.
 {6.208}


151. We see these rules enforced before our eyes,

None but the brahmins offer sacrifice,

None but the Khattiya exercises sway,

The Vessas plough, the Suddas must obey.


152-154. These greedy liars propagate deceit,

And fools believe the fictions they repeat;

He who has eyes can see the sickening sight;

Why does not Brahma set his creatures right?


155. If his wide power no limits can restrain,

Why is his hand so rarely spread to bless?


156. Why are his creatures all condemned to pain?

Why does he not to all give happiness?

Why do fraud, lies, and ignorance prevail?

Why triumphs falsehood, truth and justice fail?


157. I count your Brahma the unjust among,

Who made a world in which to shelter wrong.

Those men are counted pure who only kill

Frogs, worms, bees, snakes or insects as they will,

These are your savage customs which I hate,

Such as Kamboja 
The Kambojas were a north-western tribe who were supposed to have lost their original Aryan customs and to have become barbarous, see 
Manu,
 x. 44.
 hordes might emulate.
 {6.210}


158. If he who kills is counted innocent,

And if the victim safe to heaven is sent,
 {6.211}

Let brahmins brahmins kill â so all were well â

And those who listen to the words they tell.


159. We see no cattle asking to be slain

That they a new and better life may gain,

Rather they go unwilling to their death,

And in vain struggles yield their latest breath.


160. To veil the post, the victim and the blow

The brahmins let their choicest rhetoric flow;

The post shall as a cow of plenty be

Securing all your heartâs desires to thee;


161-162. But if the wood thus round the victim spread

Had been as full of treasure as they said,
 [6.111]

As full of silver, gold and gems for us,

With heavenâs unknown delights as overplus,

They would have offered for themselves alone

And kept the rich reversion as their own.


163-164. These cruel cheats, as ignorant as vile,

Weave their long frauds the simple to beguile,

Offer your wealth, cut nails and beard and hair,

And you shall have your bosomâs fondest prayer.

The offerer, simple to their heartsâ content,

Comes with his purse, they gather round him fast,


165-166. Like crows around an owl, on mischief bent, 
{6.212}

And leave him bankrupt and stripped bare at last,

The solid coin which he erewhile possessed,

Exchanged for promises which none can test.


167. Like grasping strangers 
A-kÄsiyÄ
.
 sent by those who reign,

The cultivatorsâ earnings to distrain,

These rob whereâer they prowl with evil eye,

No law condemns them, yet they ought to die.


168. The priests a shoot of Butea must hold

As part oâ the rite sacred from days of old;

Sakkaâs right arm âtis called; but were it so,

Would Sakka triumph oâer Asura foe?


169. Sakkaâs own arm can give him better aid,

âTwas no vain sham which made hellâs hosts afraid.

Each mountain-range which now some kingdom guards

Was once a heap in ancient altar-yards,


171. And pious worshippers with patient hands

Piled up the mound at some great lordâs commands.

So brahmins say, fie on the idle boast,

Mountains are heaved aloft at other cost;


172-173. And the brick mound, search as you may, contains

No veins of iron for the minerâs pains.
 {6.213}

A holy seer well known in ancient days,

On the seashore was praying, legend says;


174. There was he drowned and since this fate befell

The oceanâs waves have been undrinkable.

Rivers have drowned their learned men at will

By hundreds and have kept their waters still;


175. Their streams flow on and never taste the worse,

Why should the sea alone incur the curse?

And the salt-streams which run upon the land

Spring from no curse but own the diggerâs hand.


176. At first there were no women and no men;

âTwas mind first brought mankind to light, and then,

Though they all started equal in the race,

Their various 
Vossaggavibhaá¹gam
 may mean âdifference of occupation.â
 failures made them soon change place;


177. It was no lack of merit in the past,

But present faults which made them first or last.
 [6.112]

A clever low-caste lad would use his wit,

And read the hymns nor find his head-piece split;


178. The brahmins made the Vedas to their cost

When others gained the knowledge which they lost.

Thus sentences are made and learned by rote

In metric forms not easily forgot,

The obscurity but tempts the foolish mind,

They swallow all theyâre told with impulse blind.


179. Brahmins are not like violent beasts of prey,

No tigers, lions of the woods are they;

They are to cows and oxen near akin,

Differing outside they are as dull within.
 {6.214}


180. If the victorious king would cease to fight

And live in peace with his friends and follow right,

Conquering those passions which his bosom rend,

What happy lives would all his subjects spend!


181. The brahminâs Veda, Khattiyaâs policy,

Both arbitrary and delusive be,

They blindly grope their way along a road

By some huge inundation overflowed.


182. In brahminâs Veda, Khattiyaâs policy,

One secret meaning we alike can see;

For after all, loss, gain and glory, and shame

Touch the four castes alike, to all the same.


183. As householders to gain a livelihood

Count all pursuits legitimate and good,

So brahmins now in our degenerate day

Will gain a livelihood in any way.


184. The householder is led by love of gain,

Blindly he follows, dragged in pleasureâs train,

Trying all trades, deceitful and a fool,

Fallen, alas, how far from wisdomâs rule.â
 {6.217}

185. âWhose drums are these? Whose tabours, conchs, and what those instruments, whose voice

Swells with deep concert through the air and makes the monarchâs heart rejoice? 
[6.113]


186. Who is this youth who marches there, with quiver and with bow arrayed,

Wearing a golden coronet that shines like lightning round his head?


187. Who is it that approaches there, whose youthful countenance shines bright,

Like an acacia brand which glows in a smithâs forge with steady light?
 {6.218}


188-189. Whose bright umbrella, golden-hued, oâerpowers the sun in noondayâs pride,

While deftly hangs a fly-flapper ready for action by his side?


190-192. See peacocksâ tails on golden sticks wave by his face with colours blent, 
Does this refer to his whiskers? Or is it to be taken literally?

While his bright earrings deck his brow as lightning wreaths the firmament.


193-195. What hero owns that long large eye, that tuft of wool between the brows,

Those teeth as white as buds or shells, their line so faultless and so even,

Those lac-dyed hands, those bimba lips, he shines forth like the sun in heaven;


196. Like some tall SÄl tree full of bloom, upon a mountain peak alone,

Sakka in his triumphant dress with every Yakkha foe oâerthrown.


197. Who is it bursts upon our view, drawing from out its sheath his brand,

Its jewelled handle and rich work radiant with splendour in his hand,


198. Who now takes off his golden shoes, richly inwrought with varied thread,

And, bending with obeisance low, pours honour on the sageâs head?â
 {6.219}

199. âThese are all Dhataraá¹­á¹­haâs sons, having Powers and great in fame,

They all revere SamuddajÄ and her as common mother claim.â

After the lesson the Teacher exclaimed, âThus pious disciples, wise men of former times before the Buddha was born, gave up the glory of the NÄga state and rigorously fulfilled the duties of the Uposatha,â and he then identified the birth, âAt that time the family of the great king were my father and mother, Devadatta was the hunter brahmin, Änanda was Somadatta, Uppalavaá¹á¹Ä was AccimukhÄ«, SÄriputta was Sudassana, MoggallÄna was Subhaga, Sunakkhatta was KÄá¹Äriá¹­á¹­ha, and I myself was BhÅ«ridatta.â

In the present the Buddha enters RÄjagaha with the former fire-worshipper Kassapa who declares his allegiance to the Buddha. The Buddha tells a story of a king who asks a heretic about virtue, and gets misled. His daughter the princess teaches him the true doctrine and converts him. He then questions the MahÄbrahma NÄrada and gets further instruction.

## Full Story
âThere was a king of the Videhas.â
 [6.114]
 This story was told by the Teacher, while dwelling in the Laá¹­á¹­hivana pleasure garden, in relation to the conversion of UruvelÄ Kassapa. Now the Teacher by whom the glorious reign of Dhamma was begun, 
{6.220}
 after converting the ascetics UruvelÄ Kassapa and the rest, came to the pleasure garden of Laá¹­á¹­hivana, surrounded by the thousand bhikkhus who had before been ascetics, in order to persuade the king of Magadha to keep his promise; 
He gave the Veá¸·uvana pleasure garden to the fraternity, 
MahÄvagga
 i. 22. cf. this introduction with the whole chapter.
 and at that time, when the Magadha king, who had come with an attending company of twelve myriads, had seated himself, after saluting the One with Ten Powers, a dispute arose among the brahmins and householders of his train, âHas UruvelÄ Kassapa placed himself under the spiritual guidance of the great ascetic, or has the great ascetic placed himself under the spiritual guidance of UruvelÄ Kassapa?â Then the Fortunate One thought to himself, âI will show them that Kassapa has placed himself under my spiritual guidance,â and he uttered this verse:

âWhat was it that you saw, O inhabitant of UruvelÄ,

that you, renowned for your asceticism, 
Or perhaps âyou, an ascetic and a teacher.â See Rhys Davidâs note 
Vinaya,
 translation, i. p. 138. See 
JÄtaka
 i. p. 83, 
Vin.
 i. p. 36.
 abandoned your sacred fire?

I ask you, Kassapa, this question,

how is it that your fire sacrifice has been deserted?â

Then the elder, who understood the Buddhaâs purport, replied in this verse:

âThe sacrifices only speak of forms and sounds and tastes,

and sensual pleasures and women; and knowing that all these things,

being found in the elements of material existence, are filth,

I took no more delight in sacrifices or offerings.â

And in order to show that he was a disciple, he laid his head upon the TathÄgataâs feet and said: âThe Fortunate One is my teacher, and I am his disciple.â So saying he rose into the air seven times, to the height of a palm tree, two palm trees, and so on to seven palm trees, and then having come down and saluted the Fortunate One, he sat down on one side.


The great multitude when they saw that miracle uttered the glories of the Teacher, saying: âO great is the power of TathÄgata; though filled with such a firm conviction of his own, and though he believed himself to be a saint, UruvelÄ Kassapa burst the bonds of error and was converted by the TathÄgata.â The Teacher said: âIt is not wonderful that I who have now attained omniscience should have converted him; in olden time when I was the Brahma named NÄrada and still subject to passion, I burst this manâs bonds of error and made him humble,â and so saying he told the following, at the request of the audience.

1. âThere was a Khattiya king of the Videhas named Aá¹gati, possessing many carriages, wealthy and with an innumerable army.


2-3. One day on the fifteenth night of the fortnight, ere the first watch was over, on the full moon of the fourth month of the rains, he gathered his ministers together, Vijaya, and SunÄma, and the general AlÄtaka, all wise, fathers of sons, wearing a smile, and full of experience.


4. The Videha king questioned them, âLet each of you utter his wish, this is the full moon of the fourth month, it is moonlight without any darkness; with what diversion tonight shall we pass the time away?â

5-6. âThen the general AlÄta thus spoke to the king, âLet us gather a gallant army together; 
{6.222}
 let us go forth to battle, with a countless host of men; let us bring under your power those who have kept themselves independent; this is my opinion, let us conquer what is still unconquered.â


7-8. Hearing the words of AlÄta, SunÄma spoke thus, âAll your enemies, O king, are met together here, they have laid aside their strength and behave themselves with submission; today is the chief festival; war pleases me not.


9. Let them forthwith bring to us meat and drink and all kinds of food: O king, enjoy your pleasure in dance and song and music.â


10-11. Hearing the words of SunÄma, Vijaya spoke thus, âAll pleasures, O great king, are always ready at your side; these are not hard to find, so as to rejoice in all your desires: but even if they are always attained, this resolution is not approved by me.


12. Let us wait on some ascetic or brahmin learned in sacred lore, one who versed in the text and its meaning may remove our doubt today as to the object of our desire.â 
ise
. 


13. Having heard the words of Vijaya, the king Aá¹gati said: âThis saying of Vijaya is what pleases me also.


14. Let us wait on some ascetic or brahmin learned in sacred lore, one who versed in the sacred text and its meaning may remove our doubt today as to the object of our desire.


15. Do you all carry out this resolution; on what teacher shall we wait? Who, today, versed in the sacred text and its meaning, will remove our doubt as to the object of our desire?â


16-17. Having heard the words of Videha, AlÄta replied, âThere is yonder a naked ascetic in the deer-park, approved by all as wise, Guá¹a, of the Kassapa family, famous, a man of varied discourse, and with a large following of disciples; wait on him, O king, he will remove our 
[6.116]
 doubt.â


18. Having heard the words of AlÄta, the king commanded his charioteer, âWe will go to the deer-park, bring here the chariot yoked.â
 {6.223}


19. Then they yoked his chariot made of ivory and with silver decorations, having its equipage all bright and clean, white and spotless like a clear night 
DosinÄ
.
 in its appearance.


20. Four Sindh horses were yoked therein, white as lilies, swift as the wind, well-trained, wearing golden wreaths, white the umbrella, white the car, white the horses and white the fan.


21-22. The Videha king as he set out with his counsellors shone like the moon. Many wise and strong men armed with spears and swords, mounted on horses, followed the king of heroes.


23-24. Having traversed the distance, as it were, in a moment, and alighted from the chariot, the Videha king with his ministers approached Guá¹a on foot; and even the brahmins and wealthy men who were already gathered at the place the king did not order to be removed, though they left him no room.â
 {6.224}

25. âThen the king sat down on one side on a soft mattress, covered with soft variegated squirrel-skins and with a soft cushion put over them.


26. The king, being seated, addressed him with the compliments of friendship and civility, âAre your bodily needs provided for? Are your vital airs not wasted?


27. Is your mode of life comfortable? Do you get your due supply of alms? Are your movements unimpeded? Is your sight unimpaired?â


28. Guá¹a courteously answered the Videha king who was so attentive to his duties, âAll my wants are provided for, and those two last-mentioned points are as I would wish them.


29. You too, are your neighbours not too strong for you? Have you such good health as you need? Does your chariot carry you well? Have you none of the sicknesses which afflict the body?â


30. The king, seeking to know the Dhamma, having received this kindly greeting, next proceeded to ask him concerning the meaning and text of the Dhamma and the rules of right conduct.


31. âHow, O Kassapa, should a mortal fulfil the Dhamma towards his parents, how towards his teacher, and how towards his wife and children?


32. How should he behave towards the aged, how towards ascetics and brahmins, how should he deal with his army, how with the people in the country?


33. How should he practise the Dhamma and so eventually attain to heaven? And how do some on account of unrighteousness fall down into hell?â
 {6.225}

34. âHaving heard the Videha kingâs words, Kassapa thus replied, âHear, O king, a true unerring utterance.


35. There is no fruit, good or evil, in following the Dhamma; there is no other world, O king, who has ever come back hither from thence?


36. There are no ancestors, how can there be father or mother? There is no teacher, who will tame what cannot be tamed?


37. All beings are equal and alike, there are none who should receive or pay honour; there is no such thing as strength or courage, how can there be vigour or heroism?
 [6.117]
 All beings are predestined, just as the stern-rope must follow the ship.


38-39. Every mortal gets what he is to get, what then is the use of giving? There is no use, O king, in giving, the giver is helpless and weak; gifts are enjoined by fools and accepted by the wise; weak fools who think themselves wise give to the prudent.â
 {6.226}

40-41. âThere are seven aggregates indestructible and uninjuring, fire, earth, water, air, pleasure, and pain, and the soul; of these seven there is none that can destroy or divide, nor are they ever to be destroyed; weapons pass harmless amongst these aggregates.


42. He who carries off anotherâs head with a sharp sword does not divide these aggregates: how then should there be any consequence from evil doing?


43. All beings become pure by passing through eighty-four great aeons; till that period arrives not even the self-restrained becomes pure.


44. Till that period arrives, however much they have followed virtue, they do not become pure, and even if they commit many defilements they do not go beyond that limit.


45. One by one we are purified through the eighty-four great aeons: we cannot go beyond our destiny any more than the sea beyond its shore.â â
 {6.227}

46. âHaving heard Kassapaâs words, AlÄta thus replied, âWhat you say approves itself also to me. I too remember having gone through a former birth.


47-48. I was a cow-killing huntsman named Piá¹gala in a city. Many a wrong did I commit in wealthy Benares, many living creatures I slew, buffaloes, hogs, and goats.


49. Passing from that birth, I was then born in the prosperous family of a general; verily there are no evil consequences for wrongdoing, I did not have to go to hell.â


50-51. Now there happened to be a slave clothed in rags, named BÄ«jaka, who was keeping the fast, and who had come to listen to Guá¹a; when he heard Kassapaâs words and AlÄtaâs reply, he drew many a hot sigh and burst into tears.


52. The Videha king asked him, âWhy do you weep? What have you seen or heard? Why do you show me your pain?â
 {6.228}


53-55. BÄ«jaka replied, âI have no pain to vex me: listen to me, O king. I too remember my former birth, a happy one; I was one Bhavaseá¹­á¹­hi in the city of SÄketa, devoted to virtue, pure, given to alms, and esteemed by brahmins and rich men; and I remember no single evil deed that I committed.


56-58. But when I passed from that life I was conceived in the womb of a poor prostitute, and was born to a miserable life. But miserable as I am I keep my tranquil mind, and I give half of my food to whosoever desires it. I fast every fourteenth and fifteenth day, and I never hurt living creatures, and I abstain from theft.


59-61. But all the good deeds which I do produce no fruit; as AlÄta says, I think that virtue is useless. I lose my game in life as an unskilful dice-player; AlÄta wins as he has done, just like a skilled player; I see no door by which I may go to heaven; it is for this that I weep when I heard what Kassapa said.â
 {6.229}


62-63. Having heard BÄ«jakaâs words, king Aá¹gati said: âThere is no door to heaven: only wait on destiny. Whether your lot be happiness or misery, it is only gained through destiny: all will at last reach deliverance from transmigration; be not eager for the future.


64. I too have been fortunate in former births and devoted to brahmins and rich men, but while I was busy administering the laws I myself had meanwhile no enjoyment.â

65. We may yet see one another again and meet hereafter.â

So saying the king of Videha went to his home.
 {6.230}

66. When the night turned to day Aá¹gati summoned his ministers into his presence and thus addressed them:


67. âIn the Candaka palace let them always provide pleasures ready for me, let no one come with messages concerning public or secret matters.


68. Let Vijaya, SunÄma, and the general AlÄtaka, all three well-skilled in law, sit in judgment on these matters.â


69. So the king, having said this, thought only of pleasure and busied himself no more in the company of brahmins and wealthy men.


70. Then on the fourteenth night the dear daughter of the king, named RujÄ, said to her nurse-mother:


71. âAdorn me quickly with my jewels, let my female companions wait on me; tomorrow is the sacred fifteenth day, I will go into the royal presence.â


72-73. They brought her a garland and precious sandalwood, gems, shells, pearls, and precious things and garments of various dyes; and her many attendants, surrounding her as she sat on a golden chair, adorned her, shining in her beauty.
 {6.231}


74. Then in the midst of her train, blazing with all kinds of ornaments, RujÄ entered the palace Candaka as lightning enters a cloud.


75. Having drawn near the king and saluted him, with all due respect, 
Vinaye rataá¹
 seems used adverbially.
 she sat down on one side on a chair inlaid with gold.
 {6.232}


76. The king, when he beheld her surrounded by her train as if a company of AccharÄ had visited him, thus addressed her:


77. âDo you enjoy yourself in the tank within the precincts of the palace? Do they always bring you all sorts of delicate food?


78. Do you and your maidens gather all kinds of garlands and build bowers for yourselves continually, intent upon sport? Is anything wanting to you?


79. Let them bring it forthwith, ask what you will, impetuous 
Prof. Cowell has written in the margin, âcp. 
caá¹á¸i
; but the commentator explains 
kuá¸á¸amukhÄ«

(sÄsapakuá¸á¸ena... sÄsapakakkena)

 one, even though it be as hard to get as the moon.â


80. Hearing his words RujÄ answered her father, âO king, in my lordâs presence every desire of mine is gained.


81. Tomorrow is the sacred fifteenth day, let them bring me a thousand pieces, that I may give it all as a gift to the mendicants.â
 [6.119]


82. Hearing RujÄâs words king Aá¹gati replied, âMuch wealth has been wasted by you idly and without fruit.


83. You keep the Uposathas and neither eat nor drink; this idea of the duty of fasting comes from destiny, there is no merit because you abstain. 
A couplet has here been omitted, referring to BÄ«jaka, and almost the same as the lines on p. 227
23
 ff.: âBÄ«jaka wept to hear what Kassapa said.â Obviously they do not belong to this place.
 
{6.233}


84-85. While you live with us, RujÄ, put not food away; there is no other world than this, why vex thyself for nought?â


86. Then RujÄ bright in her beauty, when she heard his words, thus answered him, knowing as she did the past and the future law:


87. âI have heard in time past and I have seen it with mine own eyes, he who follows children becomes himself a child.


88. The fool who associates with fools plunges deep into folly. It is fitting for AlÄta and BÄ«jaka to be deceived. 
{6.234}


89. But you are a king full of learning, wise and skilled in the conduct of affairs; how have you fallen into such a low theory, worthy of children?


90. If a man is purified by the mere course of existence, then Guá¹aâs own asceticism is useless; like a moth flying into the lighted candle, the idiot has adopted a naked mendicantâs life.


91. Having accepted the idea that all will at last be purified through transmigration, in their great ignorance many corrupt their actions; and being fast caught in the effects of former defilements they find it hard to escape, as the fish from the hook.


92. I will tell you a parable, O king, for your case; the wise sometimes learn the truth by a parable.


93-94. As the ship of the merchants, heavy through taking in too large a cargo, sinks overladen into the sea, so a man, accumulating wrong little by little, sinks overladen into hell.


95-96. AlÄtaâs present cargo, O king, is not what he is collecting now; for that which he is now taking on board he will hereafter sink to hell. Formerly AlÄtaâs deeds were righteous, and it is as their result that he enjoys this prosperity.


97. That merit of his is being spent, for he is all intent upon vice; having forsaken the straight road, he is running headlong in a crooked path.
 {6.235}


98-99. As the balance properly hung in the weighing-house 
Obscure.
 causes the end to swing up when the weight is put in, so does a man cause his fate at last to rise if he gathers together every piece of merit little by little, like that slave BÄ«jaka intent on merit and thinking too much of heaven.


100-101. In the sorrow which the slave BÄ«jaka now suffers he receives the fruit of defilements which he formerly committed. That wrong is melting away since he is devoted to moral virtue, but let him not enter into Kassapaâs devious paths.â

102. âWhatever friend a king honours, whether he be good or evil, devoted to vice or to virtue, the king falls into his power.


103. As is the friend whom he chooses for himself and follows, such he himself becomes, such is the power of intimacy. 
{6.236}


104. One in constant intercourse affects his fellow, a close comrade his associate, just as a poisoned arrow defiles a pure quiver. Let not the wise become the friend of the wicked for fear of contamination.


105-106. If a man ties up stinking fish with a band of kusa grass, the grass will acquire a putrid smell, so is intimacy with a fool; but if a man binds up myrrh in a common leaf, it will acquire a pleasant odour, so is intimacy with the wise.


107. Therefore, knowing the maturity of his own actions like the ripeness of a basket of fruit, let not the wise man follow the wicked but follow the good, for the wicked lead to hell, while the good bring us to heaven.â

108-109. âI too remember seven births which I have experienced, and when I go from my present life I shall yet pass through seven future ones. My seventh former birth, O king, was as the son of a smith in the city RÄjagaha in Magadha.


110. I had an evil companion and I committed much evil; we went about corrupting other menâs wives as if we had been immortal.


111-112. Those actions remained laid up like fire covered with ashes. By the effect of other actions I was born in the land of Vaá¹sa 
{6.237}
 in a merchantâs family in KosambÄ«, great and prosperous and wealthy: I was an only son, continually fostered and honoured.


113. There I followed a friend who was devoted to good works, wise and full of sacred learning, and he grounded me in what was good.


114. I fasted through many a fourteenth and fifteenth night; and that action remained laid up like a treasure in water.


115. But the fruit of the evil deeds which I had done in Magadha came round to me at last like a noxious poison.


116. I passed from thence for a long time, O king, into the Roruva hell, I endured the effects of my own works; when I remember it grieves me still.


117. After spending there a wretched time through a long series of years, I became a castrated goat in Bheá¹á¹Äkaá¹­a. 
{6.238}


118. I carried the sons of the wealthy on my back and in a carriage; it was the fated consequence of my going after other menâs wives.

119. âPassing from this birth, O king, I was born as a monkey in a great forest; I was mutilated by the fierce leader of the herd: this was the fated consequence of my going after other menâs wives.â

120. âI was next born, O king, as an ox among the Dasaá¹á¹as, castrated but swift and fair to look at, and I long drew a carriage: this was the fatal consequence of my going after other menâs wives.


121. When I passed from that birth I was born in a family among the VajjÄ« people 
They live on the northern shores of the Ganges, opposite to Magadha.
 but I was neither man nor woman, for it is a very hard thing to attain the being born as a man; this was the fatal consequence of my going after other menâs wives.


122-123. Next, O king, I was born in the Nandana wood, an AccharÄ of a lovely complexion in the heaven of the Thirty-Three, dressed in garments and ornaments of various hues and wearing jewelled earrings, skilled in dance and song, an attendant in Sakkaâs court.


124. While I stayed there I remembered all these births and also the seven future births which I shall experience when I go from hence.


125. The good which I did in KosambÄ« has come round in its turn, and when I pass from this birth I shall be born only among gods or men.


126. For seven births, O king, I shall be honoured and worshipped, but till the sixth is past I shall not be free from my female sex. 
{6.239}


127. But there is my seventh birth, O king, a prosperous Devaputta, I shall be born at last as a male deity in a divine body.


128. Even today they are gathering garlands from the heavenly tree in Nandana, and there is a Devaputta, named Java, who is seeking a garland for me.


129. These sixteen years of my present life are only as one moment in heaven â a hundred mortal autumns are only as one heavenly day and night.


130. Thus do our actions follow us even through countless births, bringing good or evil, no action is ever lost.â
 {6.240}

131. âHe who desires to rise continually from birth to birth, let him avoid anotherâs wife as a man with washed feet the mire.


132. He who desires to rise continually from birth to birth, let him worship the Lord as his attendants worship Sakka.


133. He who wishes for heavenly enjoyments, a heavenly life, glory, and happiness, let him avoid defilements and follow the threefold law.


134. Watchful and wise in body, word and thought, he follows his own highest good, be he born as a woman or a man.


135. Whosoever are born glorious in the world and nursed in all 
[6.121]
 pleasures, without doubt in former time they had lived a virtuous life; all beings separately abide by their own deserts.


136. Do you thyself think, O king, what caused you to own these wives of thine like AccharÄ, beautifully adorned and dressed with golden nets?â
 {6.241}

137. âThus did the maiden RujÄ please her father, she taught the bewildered one the true road, and devoutly declared to him the Dhamma.â

138. âThen NÄrada came down to men from the Brahma Realm, and surveying JambudÄ«pa he beheld king Aá¹gati.


139. Then he stood on the palace before the king, and RujÄ, having beheld him, saluted the divine sage who had come.â
 {6.243}

140. Then the king, alarmed in his mind, having come down from his seat spoke thus to NÄrada, making his inquiries:


141. âWhence come you, of heavenly aspect, like the moon illumining the night; tell me in answer your name and family, how do they call you in the world of men?â

142. âI come now from the gods like the moon illumining the night, I tell you my name and family as you ask: they know me as NÄrada and Kassapa.â

143. âIn that you go and stand in this marvellous fashion, I ask you, O NÄrada, what does it mean; for what reason is this miracle wrought?â
 {6.244}

144. âTruth, righteousness, self-command, and liberality, these were in old days my notorious virtues; by these same virtues diligently followed I go swift as thought wherever I desire.â

145. âYou utter a marvel when you talk of the might brought by good actions; if these things are as you say, NÄrada, this question, being asked, do you answer me truly.â

146. âAsk me, O king; this is your business; this doubt of thine which you feel, I will assuredly solve it for you by reasoning, by logic, and by proofs.â
 [6.123] {6.245}

147. âI ask you this matter, O NÄrada; give me not a false answer to my question; are there really Devas or Petas, is there another world as people say?â

148. âThere are indeed Devas and Petas, there is another world as people say; but men being greedy and infatuated with pleasure know not of another world in their delusion.â

149. âIf you believe, NÄrada, that there is in another world a dwelling-place for the dead, then give me here five hundred pieces, and I will give you a thousand in the next world.â

150. âI would give you the five hundred if I knew that you were virtuous and generous; but who would press you for the thousand in the next world, if you, the merciless one, were dwelling in hell?


151. Here when a man is averse to virtue, a lover of wrong, idle, and cruel, wise men do not entrust a loan to him: there is no return from such a debtor. 
{6.246}


152. When men know that another is skilful, active, virtuous and generous, they invite him to borrow by the advantages they hold out; when he has done his business, he will bring back what he has borrowed.â

153. âWhen you go hence you will see yourself dragged by flocks of ravens and devoured by them as you live in hell, and by crows, vultures, and hawks, with your body torn and dripping blood: who would press you for a thousand pieces in the next world?â
 {6.247}

154. âBlind darkness is there, and no moon or sun, a hell evermore tumultuous and dreadful; it is not known as either night or day: who would wander seeking money in such a place?â
 [6.124]

155. âTwo dogs Sabala and SÄma of giant size, mighty and strong, devour with their iron teeth him who is driven hence and goes to another world.â

156. âAs he lives in hell thus devoured by cruel beasts of torture, with his body torn and dripping blood, who would press him for a thousand pieces in the next world?
 {6.248}


157. With arrows and well-sharpened spears the KÄá¸·Å«pakÄá¸·as as enemies smite and wound him in hell who before committed evil.


158. As he wanders in hell thus smitten in belly and side, and with his entrails mangled, his body torn and dripping blood, who would press him for a thousand pieces in the next world?


159. Heaven rains down these spears, arrows, javelins and spikes and various weapons, flames fall like burning coals, it rains missiles of rock on the cruel man.


160. An intolerable hot wind blows in hell, not even a transient pleasure is felt there; rushing about, sick, with no refuge, who would press him for a thousand pieces in the next world?


161. Hurrying along yoked in chariots, treading along the fiery ground, 
{6.249}
 urged on with goads and sticks, who would press him for a thousand pieces in the next world?


162. As he climbs a fearful blazing mountain studded with razors, his body gashed and dripping with blood, who would press him for a thousand pieces in the next world?


163. As he climbs a dreadful blazing heap of burning coals like a mountain, with his body all burned, and miserable, and weeping, who would press him for a thousand pieces in the next world?


164-165. There are lofty thickets like heaps of clouds, full of thorns, with sharp iron spikes which drink the blood of men, women and men who go after other peopleâs wives have to climb it, driven on by the servants of Yama bearing spears in their hands.


166-167. As he climbs the infernal silk-cotton tree all covered with blood, his body gashed and flayed, sick and racked with pain, panting with deep hot sighs and thus expiating his former crimes, who would ask him for his old debt?
 {6.250}


168-169. There are lofty forests like heaps of clouds, covered with swords for leaves, armed with iron knives which drink the blood of men; as he climbs the tree with iron leaves, cut with sharp swords, his body gashed and dripping blood, who would press him for the thousand pieces in the next world?


170. When he escapes from that hell of iron leaves and falls into the river Vetaraá¹Ä«, who would ask him for his old debt?


171-172. On flows the river VetaranÄ«, cruel 
khara
 might mean âsolid.â
 with boiling water and covered with iron lotuses and sharp leaves; as he is hurried along covered with blood and with his limbs all cut, in the stream of VetaranÄ« where there is nothing to rest upon, who would ask him for his debt?â
 [6.125]

173. âI tremble like a tree which is being cut down; confused in mind, I know not which way to turn; I am tormented with terror, great is my fear, when I hear these verses uttered by you.


174. As when a thing burning is plunged in the water, or like an island in a stormy ocean, or like a lamp in the darkness, you are my refuge, O sage.
 {6.251}


175. Teach me, O seer, the sacred text and its meaning; verily the past has been a wrong course; teach me, NÄrada, the path of purity, so that I may not fall into hell.â

176-177. âDhataraá¹­á¹­ha, VessÄmitta and Aá¹­á¹­haka, YÄmataggi and Usinnara and king Sivi, these and other kings, waiting diligently on brahmins and ascetics, all went to Sakkaâs heaven; do you, O king, avoid unrighteousness and follow righteousness.


178. Let them proclaim in your palace, bearing food in their hands, âWho is hungry or thirsty? Who wants a garland or ointment? What naked man would put on garments decked with various jewels?


179. Who would take an umbrella for his journey, and soft delicate shoes?â Thus let them proclaim aloud in your city evening and morning.


180. Put not to labour the aged man nor the aged ox and horse: give to each the due honour still; when he was strong he fulfilled his position of trust.â
 {6.252}

181-182. âYour body is called a chariot, swift and provided with the mind as a charioteer: having the abstinence from all injury as its axle, liberality as its covering, a careful walk with the feet as the circumference of the wheel, a careful handling with the hands as the side of the carriage; watchfulness over the belly is the name of the wheel, watchfulness over the tongue is the prevention of the wheelâs rattling.


183. Its parts are all complete through truthful speech, it is well fastened together by the absence of slander, its frame is all smooth with friendly words and joined well 
silesito
?
 with well-measured speech.


184. Well-constructed with faith and the absence of covetousness, with the respectful salutation of humility as the carriage-pole, with the shaft of gentleness and meekness, with the rope of self-restraint, according to the Five Precepts.


185-186. Steady in the absence of anger, and the white umbrella of righteousness, driven with a thorough knowledge of the proper seasons, having the three sticks 
The ascetic carried a 
tidaá¹á¸aá¹,
 three sticks in a bundle, but the reference is obscure.
 prepared in his assured confidence, having humble speech as the thong, and with the absence of vain-glory as the yoke, with the cushion of unattached thoughts.


187. Following wisdom and free from dust, let memory be your goad, and the ready application of firmness your reins.


188. Mind pursues the path of self-control with its steeds all equally trained, desire and lust are an evil path, but self-control is the straight road. 
{6.253}


189. As the steed rushes along after forms and sounds and smells, intellect uses the scourge and the self is the charioteer.


190. If one goes with his chariot, if this calmness and firmness be steadfast, he will attain all desires, O king, he will never go to hell.â
 {6.254}

The Teacher, having ended his lesson, exclaimed, âNot only now, but formerly also, monks, I converted UruvelÄ Kassapa and cut the net of heresy which bound him,â so saying, he identified the JÄtaka, and uttered these verses at the end,

191. âDevadatta was AlÄta, Bhaddaji was SunÄma, 

SÄriputta was Vijaya, MogallÄna was BÄ«jaka, 


192. The Licchavi prince Sunakkhatta was the naked ascetic Guá¹a;

In the present the monks are talking about the Buddhaâs power of argument and persuasion. The Buddha tells a story of a wise man of old whose wisdom was legendary, and the NÄgÄ« who desired his heart. A NÄga, who is in love with the NÄgÄ«, wins the wise man from the king. The wise manâs teaching though wins over the NÄga and eventually he is freed and allowed to return to his king.


The Bodhisatta = the wise Vidhura (Vidhurapaá¹á¸ita),

the great kingâs family = the wise manâs mother and father (paá¹á¸itassa mÄtÄpitaro),

## Full Story
âYou are pale and thin and weak.â
 The Teacher told this tale while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning the Perfection of Wisdom. 


One day the monks raised a discussion in the Dhamma Hall, saying: âVenerable sirs, the Teacher has great and wide wisdom, he is ready and quick-witted, he is sharp and keen-witted and able to crush the arguments of his opponents, by the power of his wisdom he overthrows the subtle questions propounded by noble sages and reduces them to silence, and having established them in the three refuges and the moral precepts, causes them to enter on the path which leads to immortality.â


The Teacher came and asked what was the topic which the monks were debating as they sat together; and on hearing what it was he said: âIt is not wonderful, monks, that the TathÄgata, having attained the Perfection of Wisdom, should overthrow the arguments of his opponents and convert nobles and others. For in the earlier ages, when he was still seeking for supreme knowledge, he was wise and able to crush the arguments of his opponents. Yea verily in the time of VidhurakumÄra, on the summit of the Black Mountain which is sixty leagues in height, by the force of my wisdom I converted the Yakkha general, Puá¹á¹aka, and reduced him to silence and made him give his own life as a gift,â and so saying he told a story of the past.

1. âThe good man who feels no anger towards one who merits anger and who never lets anger arise within him, he who even when angered does not allow it to be seen, him they indeed call an ascetic.
 {6.258}

2. âHe who bears hunger with a pinched belly, a self-restrained ascetic who eats and drinks by rule, and commits no evil for the sake of food, him they indeed call an ascetic.â

3. âHaving abandoned all sport and pleasure, he utters no false word in the world, he is averse to all outward pomp and carnal desire, such a man they indeed call an ascetic.â

4. âThose who with full knowledge abandon all that they call their own and all the workings of lust, he who is self-restrained, resolute, unselfish, and free from desire, him they indeed call an ascetic.â 
[6.129]

5. We ask you the minister of lofty wisdom: a dispute has arisen in our utterances, do you consider 
Prof. Cowell takes 
kaá¹khaá¹
 in line 26 as a participle â the verb occurs on p. 229
08
; but the commentator takes it as a noun with asyndeton. So 261
14
.
 and solve our perplexities today, let us through you today escape from our doubt.â
 {6.260}

6. âThose wise men who know the real state of things and who speak wisely at the proper time, how shall they, however wise, draw out the meaning of verses which have not been uttered to them? 


7. How does the NÄga king speak, how Garuá¸·a, the son of VinatÄ? Or what says the king of the Gandhabbas? Or how speaks the most noble king of the Kurus?â

8. âThe NÄga king preaches forbearance, Garuá¸·a the son of VinatÄ gentleness, the king of the Gandhabbas abstinence from carnal lust, and the most noble king of the Kurus freedom from all hindrances.â

9. âAll these sayings are well spoken, there is nothing here uttered amiss; and he in whom these are properly fitted 
{6.261}
 like the spokes in the nave of a wheel, he, who is endowed with these four virtues, is called an ascetic indeed.â

10. âYou are the best, you are incomparable, you are wise, a guardian and knower of the Dhamma: having grasped the problem by your wisdom, you cut the doubts in your skill as the ivory-workman the ivory with his saw.â

11. âI give you a thousand cows and a bull and an elephant, and these ten chariots drawn with thoroughbred horses, and sixteen excellent villages, being well pleased with your solution of the question.â 
[6.130] {6.262}

12. 
[FausbÃ¶ll for some unknown reason restarts the numeration here. I have opted for sequential numbering.]
 âPale and thin and weak, your colour and form was not like this before, O VimalÄ, answer my question, what is this pain of the body which has come upon you?â

13. âThere is an affection in women, it is called a longing, O king; O monarch of the NÄgas, I desire Vidhuraâs heart brought here without guile.â

14. âYou long for the moon or the sun or the wind; the very sight of Vidhura is hard to get: who will be able to bring him here?â

15. âO father, why are you full of care, why is your face like a lotus plucked by the hand? 
{6.264}
 Why are you woe-begone, O king? Do not grieve, O conqueror of enemies.â

16. âYour mother, O IrandatÄ«, desires Vidhuraâs heart, the very sight of Vidhura is hard to get, who will be able to bring him here?â

17. âDaughter, there is no one in my court who can bring Vidhura here; do you give life to your mother, and seek out some husband who can bring Vidhura.â

18. âSeek you for a husband, who shall bring Vidhura here.â And when she heard her fatherâs words, she went forth in the night and gave free course to her passionate desire.
 {6.265}

19. âWhat Gandhabba or Rakkhasa, what NÄga, Kimpurisa or man, or what sage, able to grant all desires, will be my husband the livelong night?â

20. âBe comforted, I will be your husband, I will be your husband, O you of faultless eyes: verily my knowledge is such, be comforted, you shall be my wife.â


21. Then IrandatÄ« answered, with her thoughts following the old experience of a wooing in a former birth, 
{6.266}
 âCome, let us go to my father, he will explain this matter to you.â


22. Adorned, clad in bright raiment, wearing garlands, and anointed with sandal, she seized the Yakkha by the hand and went into her fatherâs presence.
 [6.132]

23. âO NÄga chief, hear my words, receive a fitting present for your daughter; I ask for IrandatÄ«: give her to me as my possession.


24. A hundred elephants, a hundred horses, a hundred mules and chariots, a hundred complete wagons 
Vaá¸·abhi
 may mean a tent or shed.
 filled with all sorts of gems, take you all these, O NÄga king, and give me your daughter IrandatÄ«.â

25. âWait while I consult my kinsmen, my friends, and acquaintances; a business done without consultation leads afterwards to regret.â
 {6.267}


26. Then the NÄga king, having entered his palace, spoke these words as he consulted his wife,


27. âThis Puá¹á¹aka the Yakkha asks me for IrandatÄ«; shall we give her to him in exchange for much wealth?â

28. âOur IrandatÄ« is not to be won by wealth or treasure; if he obtains by his own worth and brings here the sageâs heart, the princess shall be won by that wealth, we ask no further treasure.â


29. Then the NÄga Varuá¹a went out from his palace, and, consulting with Puá¹á¹aka, thus addressed him:


30. âOur IrandatÄ« is not to be won by wealth or treasure; if you obtained by your own worth and bring here the sageâs heart, the princess shall be won by that wealth, we ask no further treasure.â

31. âHim whom some people call a sage, others will call a fool; tell me, for they utter different opinions about the matter, who is he whom you callest a sage, O NÄga?â
 {6.268}

32. âIf you have heard of Vidhura the minister of the Koravya king DhanaÃ±jaya, bring that sage here, and let IrandatÄ« be your lawful wife.â


33. Hearing these words of Varuá¹a, the Yakkha sprang up greatly pleased; just as he was, he said at once to his attendant, âBring me here my thoroughbred ready harnessed.â


34. With ears of gold and hoofs of ruby, and mail-armour of molten gold.

35. âPuá¹á¹aka, having mounted his horse, a charger fit for bearing the gods, himself richly adorned and with his beard and hair trimmed, went through the sky.


36. Puá¹á¹aka, greedy with the passion of desire, longing to win the NÄga maiden IrandatÄ«, 
{6.269}
 having gone to the glorious king, thus addressed Vessavaá¹a Kuvera:


37. âThere is the palace BhogavatÄ« called the Golden Home, the capital of the snake kingdom erected in its golden city.


38. Watch-towers which mimic lips and necks, with rubies and catâs eye jewels, palaces built of marble and rich with gold, and covered with jewels inlaid with gold. 
[6.133]


39. Mangoes, tilaka trees and Jambu plums, sattapaá¹á¹as, mucalindas and ketakas, piyakas, uddÄlakas and sahas, and sinduvÄritas with their wealth of blossom above,


40. Champacs, NÄgamÄlikÄs, bhaginÄ«mÄlÄs, and jujube trees, all these different trees bending with their boughs, lend their beauty to the NÄga palace.


41. There is a huge date palm made of precious stones with golden blossoms that fade not, and there dwells the NÄga king Varuá¹a, endowed with magical powers and born of supernatural birth.


42. There dwells his queen VimalÄ with a body like a golden creeper, tall like a young kÄlÄ plant, fair to see with her breasts like nimba fruits.


43. Fair-skinned and painted with lac dye, like a kaá¹ikÄra tree blossoming in a sheltered spot, like an AccharÄ dwelling in the Deva world, like lightning flashing from a thick cloud.
 {6.270}


44. Bewildered and full of a strange longing, she desires Vidhuraâs heart. I will give it to them, O king, and they will give me IrandatÄ«.â

45. âPuá¹á¹aka, having bidden farewell to Vessavaá¹a the glorious lord of beings, thus gave his command to his servant standing there, âBring hither my thoroughbred harnessed.â


46. With ears of gold, hoofs of ruby, and mail-armour of molten gold.


47. Puá¹á¹aka, having mounted the god-bearing steed, well-adorned and with his beard and hair well-trimmed, went through space in the sky.â

48. âHe went to pleasant RÄjagaha, the far-off city of Aá¹ga, rich in provisions and abounding with food and drink. Like MasakkasÄra, Sakkaâs capital. 
{6.272}


49. Filled with the notes of peacocks and herons, resonant, full of beautiful courts, and with every kind of bird like the mountain Himavat covered with flowers.


50. So Puá¹á¹aka climbed Mount Vepulla, with its heaps of rocks inhabited by Kimpurisas, seeking for the glorious jewel, and at last he saw it in the middle of the mountain.
 [6.134]


51-52. When he saw the glorious precious gem thus flashing light, gleaming so splendidly with its beauty, shining like lightning in the sky, he at once seized the precious lapis lazuli, the jewel of priceless value, and mounted on his peerless steed, himself of noble beauty, he rushed through space in the sky.


53. He went to the city Indapatta, and he alighted in the court of the Kurus; 
{6.273}
 the fearless Yakkha summoned the hundred warriors who were gathered there.


54. âWho wishes to conquer from us the prize of kings? Or whom shall we conquer in the contest of worth? What peerless jewel shall we win? Or who shall win our best of treasures?â â

55. âIn what kingdom is your birthplace? These are not the words of a Koravya: you surpass us all in your form and appearance; tell me your name and kindred.â

56. âI am a youth named KaccÄyana, O king; they call me one of no mean name; 
{6.274}
 my kindred and friends are in Aá¹ga; I have come here for the sake of play.â

57. âWhat jewels has the youth, which the gamester who conquers him may win? A king has many jewels, how can you, a poor man, challenge them?â

58. âThis is a fascinating jewel of mine, it is a glorious jewel which brings wealth; and the gamester who conquers me shall win this peerless steed which plagues all enemies.â

59. âWhat will one jewel do, O youth? And what will one thoroughbred avail? Many precious jewels belong to a king, and many peerless steeds swift like the wind.

60-61. âO greatest of men, behold this peerless jewel of mine; in it are the bodies of women and the bodies of men; the bodies of beasts are in it and the bodies of birds, the NÄga kings and Supaá¹á¹as, all are created in this jewel.


62-63. An elephant host, a chariot host, horses, foot-soldiers, and banners, behold this complete army created in the jewel; elephant-riders, the kingâs body-guard, warriors fighting from chariots, warriors fighting on foot, and troops in battle array, behold all created in this jewel.
 {6.276}


64. Behold created in this jewel a city furnished with solid foundations and with many gateways and walls, and with many pleasant spots where four roads meet.


65. Pillars and trenches, bars and bolts, watch-towers and gates, behold all created in the jewel.


66-67. See various troops 
cf. Ja 535 
SudhÄbhojanajÄtaka
, v. 74.
 of birds in the roads under the gateways, geese, herons, peacocks, ruddy geese and ospreys; cuckoos, spotted birds, peacocks, jÄ«vajÄ«vakas, birds of every sort behold gathered together and created in the jewel.


68-69. See a marvellous city with grand walls, making the hair stand erect with wonder, pleasant with banners upraised, and with its sands all of gold, see the hermitages divided regularly in blocks, and the different houses and their yards, with streets and blind lanes between.


70. Behold the drinking shops and taverns, the slaughter-houses and cooksâ shops, and the harlots and wantons, created in the jewel.


71. The garland-weavers, the washermen, the astrologers, the cloth merchants, the gold workers, the jewellers â behold created in the jewel.


73. See drums and tabours, conchs, tambours and tambourines and all kinds of cymbals, created in the jewel.
 {6.277}


74. Cymbals, and lutes, dance and song well executed, musical instruments and gongs, behold created in the jewel.


75. Jumpers and wrestlers too are here, and a sight of jugglers, and royal bards and barbers, behold created in the jewel.


76. Crowds are gathered here of men and women, see the seats tiers beyond tiers created in the jewel.


77. See the wrestlers in the crowd striking their doubled arms, see the strikers and the stricken, created in the jewel.


78-80. See on the slopes of the mountains troops of various deer, lions, tigers, boars, bears, wolves, and hyenas; rhinoceroses, gayals, buffaloes, red deer, rurus, antelopes, wild boars, niá¹kas and hogs, spotted kadalÄ«-deer, cats, rabbits, all kinds of hosts of beasts, created in the jewel.
 [6.136] {6.278}


81-82. Rivers well-situated, paved with golden sand, clear with flowing waters and filled with quantities of fishes; crocodiles, sea-monsters are here and porpoises and turtles, pÄá¹­hÄ«nas, pÄvusas, vÄlajas, and muÃ±jarohitas.


83. Behold created in the jewel all kinds of trees, filled with various birds, and a forest with its branches made of lapis lazuli.


84. See too lakes well-distributed in the four quarters, filled with quantities of birds and abounding with fish with broad scales.


85. See the earth surrounded by the sea, abounding with water everywhere, and diversified with trees, all created in the jewel.


86. See the Videhas in front, the GoyÄniyas behind, the Kurus and JambudÄ«pa all created in the jewel.


87. See the sun and the moon, shining on the four sides, as they go round Mount Sineru, created in the jewel.


88. See Sineru and Himavat and the miraculous sea and the four guardians of the world, created in the jewel.


89. See parks and forests, crags and mountains, pleasant to look at and full of Kimpurisas, all created in the jewel.


90. Sakkaâs gardens PhÄrusaka, CittalatÄ, Missaka, and Nandana, and his palace Vejayanta, behold all created in the jewel.


91. Sakkaâs palace Sudhamma, the heaven of the Thirty-Three, the heavenly tree PÄricchatta in full flower, and Sakkaâs elephant ErÄvaá¹a, behold created in the jewel.


92. See here the DevakaÃ±Ã±Äs risen like lightning in the air, wandering about in the Nandana, all created in the jewel.
 {6.279}


93. See the DevakaÃ±Ã±Äs bewitching the Devaputtas, and the Devaputtas wandering about, all created in the jewel,


94. Behold more than a thousand palaces covered with lapis lazuli, all created with brilliant colours in the jewel.


95. And the beings of the TÄvatiá¹sa heaven and the YÄma heaven and the Tusita heaven, and those of the Paranimmita heaven all created in the jewel.


96. See here pure lakes with transparent water covered with heavenly coral trees and lotuses and water-lilies.


97. In this jewel are ten white lines and ten beautiful lines dark blue; twenty-one brown, and fourteen yellow.


98. Twenty golden lines, twenty silver, and thirty appear of a red colour.


99. Sixteen are black, twenty-five are of the colour of madder, these are mixed with bandhuka flowers and variegated with blue lotuses.


100. O king, best of men, look at this bright flame-like jewel, perfect in all its parts, this is the destined prize 
odhisuá¹kaá¹
?
 for him who wins.â

101. âO king, proceed to the appointed goal, you have not such a jewel: let us conquer by fair dealing, and by the absence of violence, and when you are conquered pay down your stake.â

102. âO lofty PaÃ±cÄla and Surasena, O Macchas, and Maddas, with the Kekakas, let them all see that the contest is without treachery, no one is to interfere in our assembly.â
 {6.281}

103. âThe king of the Kurus and the Yakkha Puá¹á¹aka entered wild with the intoxication of play; the king played the losing throw and the Yakkha Puá¹á¹aka the winning throw.


104. They two met there in contest in the presence of the kings and amidst the witnesses, the Yakkha conquered the mightiest of men and loud was the tumult which arose there.â

105. âVictory and defeat belong to one or another of the contending parties, O king; O king, you have lost the great prize; being worsted, pay down the price forthwith.â

106. âElephants, oxen, horses, jewels and earrings, whatever gems I have in the earth, take the best of wealth, O KaccÄna, take it and go where you wish.â

107. âElephants, oxen, horses, jewels and earrings, whatever gems you have in the earth, Vidhura the minister is the best of them all, he has been won by me, pay him down to me.â

108. âHe is my minister, my refuge and help, my shelter, my fortress and my defence, that minister of mine is not to be weighed against wealth, that minister of mine is like my life.â

109. âThere would be a long contest between you and me, let us go to him and ask him what he wishes, 
{6.284}
 let him decide this matter between us, let then what he determines be the judgment of us both.â

110. âVerily you speak truth, O youth, you utter no injustice, let us go at once and ask him: in this way we shall both be satisfied.â

111. âHave the gods truly set you among the Kurus as the councillor Vidhura firm in justice? Are you the slave or the kinsman of the king? What is your value in the world, Vidhura?â

112. âSome are slaves from their mothers, others are slaves bought for money, some come of their own will as slaves, others are slaves driven by fear. These are the four sorts of slaves among men.


113. I verily am a slave from my birth: my weal and my woe come from the king, I am the kingâs slave even if I go to another, he may give me by right to you, O young man.â

114. âThis is my second victory today, your minister when asked has answered your question; verily the best of kings is unjust; it has been well decided, but you do not give it to me.â

115. âIf he has thus answered our question, saying, âI am a slave and not a kinsman,â then take, O KaccÄna, this best of treasures, take it and go whither you will.â

116. âO Vidhura, how shall there be a prosperous life to him who lives as a householder in his own house? How shall there be for him kind favour among his own people?


117. How shall he be free from suffering? And how shall the young man who speaks truth escape all sorrow when he reaches the next world?â


118. Then Vidhura, full of wisdom and insight, he who sees the real aim and presses steadily onward, he who knows all doctrines, uttered these words:


119. âLet him not have a wife in common with another; let him not eat a dainty meal alone; let him not deal in vain conversation, for this increases not wisdom.


120. Virtuous, faithful to his duties, not careless, quick to discern, humble-minded, not hard-hearted, compassionate, affectionate, gentle. 
{6.287}


121. Skilled in winning friends, ready to distribute, prudent in arranging in accordance with the season, let him continually satisfy the monks and brahmins with food and drink.


122. Let him long for righteousness and be a pillar of the sacred text, ever ready to ask questions and let him reverentially attend to the virtuous and learned.


123. Thus shall there be a prosperous life for one who lives as a householder in his own house, thus shall there be for him kind favour among his own people.


124. Thus shall he be free from suffering; and thus the youth who speaks truth shall escape all sorrow when he reaches the next world.â
 [6.140]

125. âCome, I will now depart, you were given to me by the king; attend only to this duty â this is the ancient law.â

126. âI know it, O youth; I was won by you; I was given by the king to you; let me lodge you for three days in my home while I exhort my sons.â

127. âLet that advantage be for me too, let us dwell there three days; do, sir, whatever needs to be done in your home; instruct today your sons and your wife, that they may be happy after you are gone.â

128. âGladly assenting and eagerly longing, the Yakkha went with Vidhura; and the best of the holy ones introduced him into his home, attended by elephants and thoroughbred steeds.â

129. âHe went there to KoÃ±ca, MayÅ«ra, and Piyaketa, each of most pleasant aspect, furnished with abundance of food and plenty to eat and to drink, like Sakkaâs own palace MasakkasÄra.â

130. âThese women adorned like AccharÄ among the Devas dance and sing and address him, each better in her turn. 
varÄvaraá¹
?


131. The guardian of the Dhamma, having given him food and drink and fair women, 
{6.290}
 next, thinking only of his highest good, brought him into the presence of his wife.â
 [6.141]


132. Then he said to his wife, who was adorned with sandal and liquid perfumes and stood like an ornament of purest gold, âCome, listen, lady; call your sons here, O fair one with eyes of the hue of copper.â


133. AnujjÄ, hearing her husbandâs words, spoke to her daughter-in-law, fair-eyed and with nails like copper, âO CetÄ, who wearest your bracelets as an armour, and are like a blue water-lily, go, call my sons hither.â â

134. âThe guardian of the Dhamma, without trembling, kissed his sons on their foreheads when they drew near, and having addressed them uttered these words, âI have been given by the king to this young man.


135. I am subject to him, but today I was free to seek my own pleasure, he will now take me and go whither he will, and I am come to admonish you, for how could I go if I had not given you safe haven?


136. If Janasandha, the king who dwells in Kurukhetta, should very earnestly ask you, âWhat do you reckon as having been ancient even in ancient time? What, did your father teach first and foremost?â and if he were then to say,


137. âYou are all of an equal position with me, which of you here is not more than a king?â 
I read the line as 
ko na idha raÃ±Ã±o abbhadhiko;
 the commentator explains it as 
ko nu.
 Do you make a respectful salutation and reply to him, âSay not so, O monarch, this is not the Dhamma; how shall the baseborn jackal be of equal position with the royal tiger?â â â
 {6.292}

138. âThen Vidhura thus addressed his friends and his enemies, his kindred, and his intimates, with his mind and will detached from all things,


139. âCome, dear ones, sit down and listen to me as I tell of a royal dwelling, how a man who enters a kingâs court may attain to honour.


140. When he enters a kingâs court he does not win honour while he is unknown, nor does one ever win it who is a coward, nor the foolish man, nor the thoughtless.


141. When the king finds out his moral qualities, his wisdom and his purity of heart, then he learns to trust him and hides not his secrets from him.


142-143. When he is asked to carry out some business, like a well-fixed balance, with a level beam, and evenly poised, he must not hesitate; if like the balance, he is ready to undertake every burden, he may dwell in a kingâs court.
 {6.293}


144. Whether by day or by night, the wiser man should not hesitate when set upon the kingâs business; such a one may dwell in a kingâs court.


145. The wise man who, when set upon the kingâs business, whether by day or by night, undertakes every commission, he is the one who may dwell in a kingâs court.


146. He who sees a path made for the king and carefully put in order for him, and refrains from entering himself therein, though advised to do so, he is the one who may dwell in a kingâs court.


147. Let him on no account ever enjoy the same pleasures as the king, let him follow behind in everything, such a one may dwell in a kingâs court.


148. Let him not put on a garment like the kingâs nor garlands nor ointment like his; let him not wear similar ornaments or practise a tone of voice like his; let him always wear a different attire, such a one may dwell in a kingâs court.


149. If the king sports with his ministers or surrounded by his wives, let not the minister make any allusion to the royal ladies.


150. He who is not lifted up, nor fickle, who is prudent and keeps his senses under control, he who is possessed of insight and resolution, such a one may dwell in a kingâs court.
 {6.294}


151. Let him not sport with the kingâs wives nor talk with them privately; let him not take money from his treasury, such a one may dwell in a kingâs court.


152. Let him not think too much of sleep, nor drink strong drink to excess, nor kill the deer in the kingâs forest, such a one may dwell in a kingâs court.


153. Let him not seat himself on the kingâs chair or couch or seat or elephant or chariot; as thinking himself a privileged person, such a one may dwell in a kingâs court.


154. Let him prudently keep not too far from the king nor yet too near to him, and let him stand ready before him, telling something for his lord to hear.


155. The king does not count as a common person, the king must not be paired with anyone else; kings are easily vexed, as the eye is hurt if touched by a barley-awn.


156. Let not the wise man, thinking himself to be held in honour, ever venture to speak roughly to the suspicious king.


157. If he gets his opportunity, let him take it; but let him not trust in kings; let him be on his guard as in the case of fire, 
[This seems to mean: when there is a fire let him take a stand (i.e not run away from danger).] 
 such a one may dwell in a kingâs court.


158. If the ruler favours his son or his brother with a gift of some villages or towns or some people in his kingdom as clients, let him quietly wait in silence, nor speak of him as prudent or faulty.
 {6.295}


159. If the king increases the pay of his elephant-driver or his life-guardsman, his chariot-soldier or his foot-soldier, through hearing some story of their exploits, let him not interfere to hinder it, such a one may dwell in a kingâs court.


160. The wise man will keep his belly small like the bow, 
The bow must not be kept bent into too great a curve.
 but he will bend easily like the bamboo; let him not go contrary to the king, 
Or âlet him not go contrary to other people.â
 so he may dwell in a kingâs court.


161. Let him keep his belly small like the bow, and let him have no tongue like the fish; let him be moderate in eating, brave and prudent; such a one may dwell in a kingâs court. 
[6.143]


162. Let him not visit a woman too often, fearing the loss of his strength; the foolish man is a victim to cough, asthma, bodily pain and childishness.


163. Let him not laugh too much, nor keep always silent; he should utter, when the due season comes, a concise and measured speech.


164. Not given to anger, not ready to take offence, truthful, gentle, no slanderer, let him not speak foolish words, such a one may dwell in a kingâs court.
 {6.296}


165. Trained, educated, self-controlled, experienced in business, 
katatto
 = 
kataá¹­á¹­o
 
(ká¹tÄrtha?)
. 
 temperate, gentle, careful, pure, skilful, such a one may dwell in a kingâs court.


166. Humble in behaviour towards the old, ready to obey, and full of respect, compassionate, and pleasant to live with, such a one may dwell in a kingâs court.


167. Let him keep at a distance from a spy sent by a foreign king to meddle; 
So the commentator seems to explain it.
 let him look to his own lord alone, and own no other king.


168-169. Let him pay respect to monks and brahmins who are virtuous and learned; let him carefully wait on them; such a one may dwell in a kingâs court.


170. Let him satisfy virtuous and learned monks and brahmins with food and drink, such a one may dwell in a kingâs court.


171. Let him draw near and devotedly attend on virtuous and learned monks and brahmins, desiring thereby his own real good.


172. Let him not seek to deprive monks or brahmins of any gift previously bestowed on them, and let him in no way hinder mendicants at a time of distributing alms.


173. One who is righteous, endowed with wisdom, and skilled in all business arrangements, and well-versed in times and seasons, such a one may dwell in a kingâs court. 
{6.297}


174. One who is energetic in business, careful and skilful, and able to conduct his affairs successfully, such a one may dwell in a kingâs court.


175. Visiting repeatedly the threshing-floor, the house, the cattle and the field, he should have the corn carefully measured and stored in his granaries, and he should have it carefully measured for cooking in his home.


176. (Let him not employ or promote) 
Some line to this effect seems to have dropped from the text.
 a son or a brother who is not steadfast in virtue; such children are no true members of oneâs own body, they are to be counted as if they were dead; let him cause clothing and food for sustenance to be given to them and let them sit while they take it.


177. Let him employ in offices of authority servants and agents who are established in virtue and are skilful in business and can rise to an emergency.


178. One who is virtuous and free from greed and devoted to his king, never absent from him 
I would read 
aviraho
.
 and seeking his interest, such a one may dwell in a kingâs court.


179. Let him know the kingâs wish, and hold fast to his thoughts, and let his action be never contrary to him, such a one may dwell in a kingâs court. 
{6.298}


180. He will rub him with perfumes and bathe him, he will bend his head low when washing his feet; when smitten he will not be angry; such a one may dwell in a kingâs court.


181. He will make his salutation to a jar full of water, or offer his reverential greeting to a crow, yes, he will give to all petitioners and be ever prudent and preeminent.


182. He will give away his bed, his garment, his carriage, his house, his home, and shower down blessings like a cloud on all beings.


183. This, sirs, is the way to dwell in a kingâs court, this is how a man is to behave himself and so to conciliate the kingâs favour, and to obtain honour from his rulers.â â 
[6.144]

184. âHaving thus counselled the company of his kindred, the wise one, surrounded by his friends, went up to the king. 
{6.299}


185. Having saluted his feet with his head and made a reverential homage, Vidhura with his hands clasped thus addressed the king,


186. âThis youth, wishing to employ me according to his will, is leading me away; I will speak for the sake of my kindred, hear what I say, O enemy-conqueror.


187. Will you be pleased to look to my sons and whatever property I may have besides in my house, so that when I am gone my company of kinsmen may not hereafter perish?


188. As when the earth trembles that which is upon it likewise trembles, and as when the earth is firm it all remains firm, 
[This seems to mean: As when those of earth stumble, the earth remains firm, so when I have stumbled (let my relatives remain firm).]
 so I see that my kindred fall in my fall; this I perceive was my error.â â

189. âYou can not go, this is my resolve; having smitten and slain this KÄtiya 
[KatiyÄna is another form of KaccÄna.].
 fellow, do you dwell here, this is what seems best to me; do not go hence, O you possessed of such vast wisdom.â

190. âDo not set your mind on unrighteousness, be you devoted to temporal and spiritual good; 
Or âthe sacred text and its inner meaning.â
 shame on an action which is ignoble and sinful, which when a man has done, he goes afterwards to hell.
 {6.300}


191. This is not righteousness, this is not what ought to be done; a king, O lord of men, is the supreme authority of a poor slave, which sets him to kill or to burn or kills by its own act; I have no wrath against him and I depart.â

192. âHaving embraced his eldest son and controlled the anguish in his heart, with eyes filled with tears he entered the palace.â

193. âThe sons and wives of Vidhura lie prostrate in the palace like SÄl trees shaken and shattered by the wind.
 {6.301}


194. A thousand wives, and seven hundred female slaves wailed stretching out their arms, in the palace of Vidhura.


195. The ladies of the harem and the princes, the Vesiyas and brahmins wailed stretching out their arms in the palace of Vidhura.


196. Elephant-drivers, the soldiers of the body-guard, charioteers and foot-soldiers wailed stretching out their arms in the palace of Vidhura.


197. The people of the country and the towns collected together wailed stretching out their arms in the palace of Vidhura.â 
[Although it goes unnoticed by the translator, he here omits four verses.]

202. âHaving done all that was to be done within the house and having instructed all the people, his friends and counsellors and companions, his wives, sons and relations.


203. Having arranged the outside work which demanded attention and informed them of the stores in the house, the treasure and the debts that were to be paid, he thus spoke to Puá¹á¹aka:


204. âYou have dwelt three days in my house, I have done all that needed to be done in my home, I have instructed my sons and my wives, let us now act according to your will, O KaccÄna.â â
 {6.302}

205. âIf, O you who attest of your own will, 
Is 
katte
 a vocative for 
katta
?
 you have instructed your sons, your wives, and your dependents, then, alas, you stand here as one about to cross: this is a long journey before you.


206. Take hold, without fear, of the tail of your noble steed, this is your last sight of the world of the living.â

207. âOf whom shall I be afraid, when I have done no evil to him by body, speech or thought, whereby I could come to misfortune?â

208. âThe prince of horses bearing Vidhura went up into the sky and soon reached the Black Mountain 
Is this 
KÄá¸·agiri
 the same as the 
KÄá¸·apabbata,
 a peak of the HimÄlayas?
 without coming into contact with the boughs of trees or the rocks.â
 {6.303}

218. âThe seer is wise, and learned, and skilful; he will soon set himself free; fear not, he will come back.â

219. âWhen he had gone there he thought to himself: âRational beings exist in various gradations; I have no possible use for his life, I will kill him and take his heart.â â
 {6.305}

220. âHaving gone there and entered within the mountain KÄtiyÄna of evil mind held him with his head downwards in the open expanse of the world. 
So, the sky.


221. While he hung there as on the precipice of hell frightful to see and most difficult to traverse, he, the best of all the Kurus in action, thus addressed Puá¹á¹aka undismayed:


222. âYou are base in your nature, though you assume for a time a noble form, utterly licentious though wearing the guise of one restrained, you are doing a cruel and monstrous deed, there is nothing good in your nature.


223. What is your reason for killing me, when you wish to see me thrown down this precipice? Your appearance bespeaks you as something superhuman, tell me what kind of a god you are.â â
 {6.307}

224. âYou have heard perchance of the Yakkha Puá¹á¹aka, he is the minister of king Kuvera. There is an earth-ruling NÄga called Varuá¹a, mighty, pure, and endowed with beauty and strength.


225. I desire his younger sister, the NÄga maiden named IrandatÄ«; for the love of that fair damsel I have set my mind on killing you, O sage.â
 [6.148]

226. âBe not deceived, O Yakkha; many people are destroyed by a thing being misunderstood; what has your love for that fair maiden to do with my death? Come, let us hear the whole.â

227. âIn my love for the daughter of that mighty NÄga I consulted her kinsfolk, and when I sought her hand my father-in-law told me that they knew that I was moved by an honourable passion.


228. âWe will give you the damsel endowed with beautiful body and eyes, fair-smiling and with her limbs perfumed with sandalwood, if you bring to me the sageâs heart won in fair fight; 
{6.308}
 the maiden is to be won by this prize, we ask no other gift besides.â


229. Thus I am not deceived, listen, O you doer of right actions; there is nothing misunderstood by me; the NÄgas will give me the NÄga maiden IrandatÄ« for your heart won in fair fight.


230. It is for this that I am set on killing you, it is in this way that I have need of your death. If I threw you hence down into hell I would kill you and take your heart.â

231. âHold me up forthwith, O KÄtiyÄna, if you needest my heart; 
{6.309}
 I will declare to you this day the Dhamma of the good man.â

232. âPuá¹á¹aka, having quickly placed the best of the performers of good actions among the Kurus upon the mountainâs summit, asked the Teacher of lofty wisdom, as he sat looking at a pipul tree:


233. âI have brought you up from the precipice, I have need of your heart this day, tell me then today the Dhamma of the good man.â â

234. âI am saved by you from the precipice; if you need my heart, I will declare to you this day the Dhamma of the good man.â 
[6.149]

235. âO youth, follow you the path already traversed; put away from you the soiled hand, 
This line seems corrupt and does not agree with the commentary, which explains it âdo not burn the wet hand.â In the verses 
addo
 is translated here both âsoiledâ and âwetâ; 
adubbha
 is the word used for âinnocent.â
 
{6.310}
 be not ever treacherous to your friends, nor fall into the power of unchaste women.â

236. âHow does one follow the path already traversed? How does one burn the wet hand? Who is the unchaste woman? Who is treacherous to his friend? Tell me the meaning at my request.â

237. âLet a man follow his actions, who invites him even to a seat, when he comes as a stranger and never seen before; him the wise call one who follows in the path already traversed.


238. In whosoever house a man dwells even for one night, and receives there food and drink, let him not conceive an evil thought against him in his mind; he who is treacherous to his friend burns the innocent hand. 
i.e. the hand which had given him food?


239. Let not a man break a bough of that tree under whose shadow he sits or lies, the wretch is treacherous to his friend.


240. Let a man give this earth filled with riches to the woman whom he has chosen, yet she will despise him if she gets the opportunity; let him not fall into the power of unchaste women.


241. Thus does a man follow the path already traversed; thus does he burn the wet hand; this is the unchaste woman; this is one that is treacherous to his friend; such a man is righteous, abandon you unrighteousness.â
 {6.311}

242. âI dwelt three days in your house, I was served with food and drink, you were my friend, I will let you go, O seer of excellent wisdom, you shall depart at your will to your own home. 
{6.312}


243. Yea, let all that concerns the NÄga race perish, I have had enough of the NÄga maiden; by your own well-spoken words you are set free, O seer, from my threatened blow today.â

244. âCome, Yakkha, carry me to your father-in-law, and act as is best towards me; I will show to him a royal NÄga palace which he has never seen before.â

245. âThe wise man should not look on that which is not for a manâs well-being; why then, O seer of excellent wisdom, do you wish to go amongst your enemies?â

246. âVerily I know it all; the wise man ought not to look upon it; but I have never at any time committed evil, and therefore I fear not the coming of death.
 {6.313}

247. âCome, you shall see with me that world of unequalled glory where the NÄga king dwells amidst dance and song like king Vessavaá¹a 
Kuvera.
 in NalinÄ«.


248. Filled with troops of NÄga maidens, gladdened constantly with their sports day and night, abounding with garlands and covered with flowers, it shines like the lightning in the sky.


249. Filled with food and with drink, with dance and song and instruments of music; filled with maidens richly attired, it shines with dresses and ornaments.â

250. âThen Puá¹á¹aka placed him, the best doer of good actions among the Kurus, on a seat behind him and carried the illustrious sage to the palace of the NÄga king.


251. When he reached that place of unrivalled glory, the sage stood behind Puá¹á¹aka; and the NÄga king, beholding the concord between them, thus addressed his son-in-law as he had done before.
 {6.314}


252. âYou did go before to the world of men, seeking for the sageâs heart; have you returned here with success, bringing the sage of unequalled wisdom?â â

253. âHe whom you desire is come, he is my guardian in duty, won by righteous means; behold him as he speaks before you, intercourse with the good brings happiness.â

254. âThis mortal, beholding me whom he had never seen before and pierced with the fear of death, does not speak to me in his terror; this is not like a wise man.â

255. âI am not terrified, O NÄga, nor am I pierced with the fear of death; the victim should not address his executioner, nor should the latter ask his victim to address him.â 
The same thought is repeated in different words after this passage [i.e vs. 256 is omitted.]

257. âIt is as you say, O sage, you speak the truth; the victim should not address his executioner nor should the latter ask his victim to address him.â 
The same thought is repeated in different words after this passage [i.e.. vs. 258 is omitted.]

259. âThis splendour and glory and this might and NÄga birth of thine, are subject to death and not immortal; I ask you this question, O NÄga king, how did you obtain this palace?


260. Was it gained without a cause or as the development of a previous condition? was it made by yourself or given by the gods? Explain to me this matter, O NÄga king, how you did win this palace.â 
See Ja 524 
Saá¹khapÄlajÄtaka
, v.24.
 {6.316}

261. âIt was not gained without a cause, nor was it the development of a previous condition; it was not made by myself nor given by the gods; this palace of mine was gained by my own virtuous deeds.â 
See Ja 524 
Saá¹khapÄlajÄtaka
, v.29.

262. âWhat holy vow was it, what practice of sanctity? Of what good action was this the fruit, this splendour and glory and might and NÄga birth of thine and this great palace, O NÄga?â 
Ja 524 
Saá¹khapÄlajÄtaka
, v.30ff, 
Sumaá¹galavilÄsinÄ«
 i. 177.

263. âI and my wife in the world of men were both full of faith and bountiful; my house was made into a drinking-hall, and ascetics and brahmins were cheered there.


264. Garlands and perfumes and ointments, lamps and couches and resting-places, raiment and beds and food and drink, I virtuously gave away there as free gifts.


265. That was my vow and practice of sanctity, this is the fruit of that good conduct, this splendour and glory and NÄga birth and this great palace, O seer.â
 {6.317}

266. âIf you have thus gained this palace, you know about the fruit of holy actions and rebirth; therefore practise virtue with all diligence that you may live again in a palace.â

267. âThere are no ascetics or brahmins here to whom we may give food and drink, O holy one; tell me this thing I pray, how may I again live in a palace?â

268. âThere are snakes who have been born here, sons and wives and dependents; commit no wrong towards them in word or deed at any time.


269. Thus follow you, O NÄga, innocence in word and deed, so shall you dwell here all your life in a palace and then depart hence to the world of the gods.â
 [6.152] {6.318}

270. âVerily that best of kings is mourning in your absence, whose intimate minister you are; having once regained you, though now distressed and sick, a man will regain happiness.â

271. âYou do indeed utter the holy words of the good, a peerless word of Dhamma; in such crises of life as these the character of men like me is made known.â

272. âSay, were you taken for nothing? Say, did he conquer you in the game? He says that he won you fairly â how did you come into his power?â

273. âPuá¹á¹aka conquered in the game with dice him who was my lord and king; 
{6.319}
 he being conquered gave me to the other; so I was won fairly and not by wrong.â


274. The great NÄga, delighted and overjoyed, when he heard these noble words of the sage, seized the lord of lofty wisdom by the hand and thus went into the presence of his wife.


275-276. âHe for whom, O VimalÄ, you grew pale and food lost its savour in your eyes, this sun, for the sake of whose heart this trouble came upon you, listen well to his words, you will never see him again.â


277. VimalÄ, when she saw the lord of great wisdom, folded the ten fingers of her hands in reverence, and thus addressed the best of the Kurus with her whole soul full of delight:


278. âThis mortal, beholding me whom he had never seen before and pierced with the fear of death, does not speak to me in his terror; this is not like a wise man.â


279. âI am not terrified, O NÄgÄ«, nor am I pierced with the fear of death; the victim should not address his executioner, nor should the latter ask his victim to address him.â 
The same dialogue is here repeated, with the gender altered to suit VimalÄ [i.e. vs. 280-297 are omitted.]
 {6.322}


298-299. Thus the NÄga maiden asked the sage the same question which the NÄga Varuá¹a had asked him before; and the sage by his answer satisfied her as he had before satisfied Varuá¹a.


300. The sage, seeing that the NÄga king and the NÄga maiden were both pleased with his answers, undaunted in soul and with not one hair erect with fear, thus addressed Varuá¹a:


301. âFear not, O NÄga, here I am; whatever use this body may be to you, whatever it can do by its heart and its flesh, I myself will carry out according to your will.â

302. âThe heart of sages is their wisdom, we are delighted today with your wisdom; let him whose name implies perfection 
anÅ«nanÄmo
? In allusion to his name Puá¹á¹aka from 
pupa
 âfull.â
 take his bride today and let him put you in possession today of the Kurus.â 
[6.153] {6.323}

303. âPuá¹á¹aka, delighted and overjoyed, having won the NÄga maiden IrandatÄ«, with his whole soul full of joy, thus addressed him who was the best of the Kurus in action:


304. âYou have made me possessed of a wife, I will do what is due to you, O Vidhura; I give this pearl of jewels and I will put you today in possession of the Kurus.â â

305. âMay your friendship with your loved wife be indissoluble, and do you in your joy with a happy heart give me the jewel and carry me to Indapatta.â

306. âThen Puá¹á¹aka placed the best of the Kurus in action on a seat before him and carried him, the lord of supreme wisdom, to the city Indapatta.


307. Swift as the mind of man may travel, his speed was even swifter still; and Puá¹á¹aka bore the best of the Kurus to the city Indapatta.â
 {6.324}

308. âBehold before you the city Indapatta and its pleasant mango groves and districts; I am possessed of a wife, and you have obtained thine own home.â

309. âPuá¹á¹aka of noble race, having set him down, the best of the Kurus in action, in the middle of the Dhamma Hall, mounted his own noble steed and sped in the sky through the air.


310. When the king beheld him, he, filled with delight, sprang up and embraced him with his arms, and without a momentâs fear seated him on a throne before him in the midst of the congregation.â

311. âYou guide us like a ready-furnished chariot, the Kurus rejoice at seeing you; answer me and tell me this, how was it that that young man let you go?â

312. âHe whom you call a young man, O great king, is no common man, O best of heroes; if you have ever heard of the Yakkha Puá¹á¹aka, it was he, the minister of king Kuvera.


313. There is a NÄga king named Varuá¹a, mighty, endowed with strength and a noble presence, now Puá¹á¹aka loves his younger daughter, the NÄga maiden IrandatÄ«. 
{6.326}


314. He laid his plan for my death for the sake of that fair maiden whom he loved, he thus obtained his wife, and I was allowed to depart and the jewel was won.â

315. âThere grew a tree before my gates, its trunk was wisdom and its boughs the moral virtues; it ripened into all that was natural and developed, its fruits were the five products of the cow, and it was covered with elephants and cattle.


316. But while it resounded with dance, song, and musical instruments a man came and cut it up from the roots and carried it away; it then came to this palace of ours, pay your homage to this tree.


317. Let all who are joyful by my means show it today by their actions; bring your presents in abundance, and pay your homage to this tree.


318. Whatever captives there may be in my realm, let them set them all loose from their captivity; as this tree has been delivered from its captivity, so let them release others from bondage.
 {6.328}


319. Let them spend this month on holiday, hanging up their ploughs; let them feast the brahmins with flesh and rice; let them drink in private, and still seem total abstainers, with their full cups flowing over.


320. Let them invite their friends on the highway, and keep a strict watch in the kingdom so that none may injure his neighbour, pay your homage to this tree.â

321. âThe queens, the princes, the vesiyas, and the brahmins brought to the sage much food and drink.


322. Riders on elephants, body-guards, riders in chariots, foot-soldiers, brought to the sage much food and drink. 
{6.329}


323. The people of the country and the city gathered together in crowds brought to the sage much food and drink.


324. The vast assembly were filled with joy, beholding the seer after he had come: when the sage had come a triumphant waving of cloths took place.â

The Teacher, having brought his lesson to an end, said: âNot only now but formerly also did the TathÄgata, having wisdom, show himself skilful in means.â Then he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time the sageâs father and mother were the royal family, the eldest queen was RÄhulaâs mother, the eldest son was RÄhula, Varuá¹a the NÄga king was SÄriputta, the Garuá¸·a king was MoggallÄna, Sakka was Anuruddha, the king DhanaÃ±jaya was Änanda, and the wise Vidhura was myself.â

## Full Story
âKing Brahmadatta of PaÃ±cÄla.â The Teacher, while dwelling at Jetavana, told this about the Perfection of Wisdom. 


One day the monks sat in the Dhamma Hall and described the TathÄgataâs Perfection of Wisdom, âMonks, the TathÄgata is greatly wise, his wisdom is vast, ready, swift, sharp, crushing heretical doctrines, after having converted, by the power of his own knowledge, the brahmins KÅ«á¹­adanta and the rest, the ascetics Sabhiya and the rest, the thieves Aá¹gulimÄla and the rest, the Yakkhas Äá¸·avaka and the rest, the Devas Sakka and the rest, and the Brahmas Baka and the rest, made them humble, and ordained a vast multitude as ascetics and established them in the fruition of the paths of sanctification.â The Teacher came up and asked what they were discoursing about, and when they told him, he replied, 
{6.330}
 âNot only now is the TathÄgata wise, in the past also, before his knowledge was fully mature, he was full of all wisdom, as he went about for the sake of wisdom and knowledge,â and then he told a story of the past.

1. âMeat, cattle, necklace, thread, son, ball and a chariot,

Pole, head and also the snake, chicken, gem, the calving,

Rice and also sand, the tank, the park, the ass, the jewel.â

2. âNo perfume collection it is; only the poor piyaá¹gu smells;

That wicked woman told a lie; the truth the village woman tells.â

3. âThink you that the sire is always better than the son, O excellent king?

Then is that creature better than the mule; the ass is the muleâs sire.â 
I do not understand 
haá¹si.

4. âThat chameleon used not to climb upon the archway: explain, Mahosadha, why the chameleon has become stiff-necked.â

5. âThe chameleon has got what he never had before, a half-anna piece; hence he despises Vedeha lord of MithilÄ.â 
{6.347}

6. âShould a woman be virtuous and fair, and a man not desire her â do you believe it Mahosadha?â 
{6.349}

7. âO king, I do believe it: the man would be an unlucky wretch; good luck and ill luck never can mate together.â

8. âTwo natural enemies, who never before in the world could come within seven paces of each other, have become friends and go around inseparable. What is the reason?â

9. âIf this day before noon you cannot solve me this question, I will banish you all. I have no need of ignorant men.â

10. âIn a great crowd, where a great din of people are assembled, our minds are distracted, our thoughts cannot concentrate, and we cannot solve the question.


11. But alone, calm in thought, apart they will go and ponder on the matter, in solitude grappling with it firmly, then they will solve it for you, O lord of men.â

12. âYoung beggars and young princes like and delight in ramâs 
The words 
meá¹á¸o
 and 
urabbho
 mean âram,â and I have translated them literally in the following verses, reserving âgoatâ for 
eá¸·aka
.
 flesh; dogâs flesh they do not eat. Yet there might be friendship betwixt ram and dog.â
 [6.178]

13. âThey take off a goatskin to cover the horseâs back withal, but a dogskin they do not use for covering: yet there might be friendship betwixt ram and dog.â 
{6.354}

14. âTwisted horns has a ram, the dog has none at all; one eats grass, one flesh: yet there might be friendship betwixt ram and dog.â

15. âGrass and leaves both the ram eat, the dog neither grass nor leaves; the dog would take a hare or a cat: yet there might be friendship betwixt ram and dog.â

16. âThe ram, with eight half-feet on his four feet, and eight hooves, unobserved, brings meat for the other, and he brings grass for him. 
I have transposed the two last lines, to suit the obvious sense; the grammar is incorrect as they stand. One might almost suppose that Senaka was reciting his verse learnt by rote [the verse is being recited by Mahosadha, of course, which is what the translator must have intended].


17. The chief of Videha, the lord of men, on his terrace beheld with his own eyes the interchange of food given by each to the other, between bow-wow and full-mouth.â

18. âNo small gain is it that I have men so wise in my house. A matter profound and subtle they have penetrated with noble speech, the clever men!â

19. âTo each I give a chariot and a female mule, to each a rich village, very choice, these I give to all the wise men, delighted at their noble speech.â

20. âEndowed with wisdom and bereft of wealth, or wealthy and without wisdom â I ask you this question, Senaka: Which of these two do clever men call the better?â

21. âVerily, O king, wise men and fools, men educated or uneducated, do service to the wealthy, although they be high-born and he be base-born. Beholding this I say: âThe wise is mean, and the wealthy is better.â â

22. âYou also I ask, lofty in wisdom, Mahosadha, who knows all the Dhamma: âA fool with wealth or a wise man with small store, which of the two do clever men call the better?â â
 {6.357}

23. The fool commits sinful acts, thinking: âIn this world I am the better;â he looks at this world and not at the next, and gets the worst of it in both. Beholding this I say: âThe wise is better than the wealthy fool.â â

24. âScience does not give riches, nor does family or personal beauty. Look at that idiot Gorimanda greatly prospering, because Luck favours the wretch.

25. âHe that is small of wit, when he gets wealth, is intoxicated: struck by misfortune he becomes stupefied: struck by ill luck or good luck as chance may come, he writhes like a fish in the hot sun. Beholding this I say: âThe wise is better than the wealthy fool.â â

26. âAs in the forest, the birds gather from all quarters to the tree which has sweet fruit, so to the rich man who has treasure and wealth crowds flock together for their profit. Beholding this I say: âThe wise is mean, the wealthy is the better.â â

27. âThe powerful fool does not well to win treasure by violence; roar loud as he will, 
i.e. 
ânirayapÄlÄ,â

 Beholding this I say: âThe wise is better than the wealthy fool.â â

28. âWhatsoever streams pour themselves into the Ganges, all these lose name and kind. The Ganges falling into the sea, is no longer to be distinguished. So the world is devoted to wealth. Beholding this I say: âThe wise is mean, the rich is better.â â

29. âThis mighty ocean of which he spoke, whereinto always flow rivers innumerable, this sea beating incessantly on the shore can never pass over it, mighty ocean though it be.


30. So it is with the chatterings of the fool: his prosperity cannot overpass the wise. Beholding this I say: âThe wise is better than the prosperous fool.â â 
{6.360}

31. âA wealthy man in high position may lack all self-control, but if he says anything to others, his word has weight in the midst of his kinsfolk; but wisdom has not that effect for the man without wealth. Beholding this I say: âThe wise is mean, the rich is better.â â

32. âFor anotherâs sake or his own the fool and small of wit speaks falsely; he is put to shame in the midst of company, and hereafter he goes to misery. Beholding this I say: âThe wise is better than the wealthy fool.â â
 [6.181]

33. âEven if one be of great wisdom, but without rice 
anÄlayo.
 Following the Sinhalese version I derive this from 
nÄli,
 a measure (of rice, &c.).
 or grain, and needy, should he say anything, his word has no weight in the midst of his kinsfolk, 
{6.361}
 and prosperity does not come to a man for his knowledge. Beholding this I say: âThe wise is mean, the rich is better.â â

34. âNot for his own sake nor anotherâs does the man of great wisdom speak a lie; he is honoured in the midst of the assembly, and hereafter he goes to happiness. Beholding this I say: âThe wise is better than the wealthy fool.â â

35. âElephants, kine, horses, jewelled earrings, women, are found in rich families; these all are for the enjoyment of the rich man without success. Beholding this I say: âThe wise is mean, the rich is better.â â

{6.362}

37. âWe are five wise men, sire, all waiting upon you with gestures of respect; and you are our lord and master, like Sakka, lord of all creatures, King of the Devas. Beholding this I say: âThe wise is mean, the rich is better.â â

38. âThe wealthy fool is but the slave of a wise man, when questions of this kind arise; when the sage solves it cleverly, then the fool falls into confusion. Beholding this I say: âThe wise is better than the wealthy fool.â â

39. âVerily wisdom is esteemed of the good; wealth is beloved because men are devoted to enjoyment. The knowledge of the Buddhas is incomparable, and wealth never surpasses wisdom.â

40. âWhatsoever I asked he has answered me, Mahosadha

63. âDo you declare your mind, O lord of the earth! You are our supporter and bear our burdens. The five clever men will understand your wish and pleasure, and will then speak, O master of men!â

64. âIf a woman be virtuous, and faithful, subservient to her husbandâs wish and will, affectionate,

69. âGood is the secrecy of a secret, the revealing of a secret is not to be praised. The clever man should keep it to himself while it is not accomplished; but after it is done he may speak when he will.â

70. âWhy are you perplexed, O king? We hear not the voice of the lord of men! What do you ponder thus downcast? There is no offence from me, my lord.â

71. âThey said, the wise Mahosadha must be slain; and condemned by me to death is the most wise one. As I think on this I am downcast. There is no fault in you, my queen.â

79. One should not disclose a secret thing, but should guard it like a treasure; for a secret thing is not well revealed by the prudent.


80. Not to a woman would the wise man tell a secret, not to a foe, nor to one who can be enticed by self-interest, nor for affectionâs sake.


81. He who discloses a secret thing unknown, through fear of broken confidence must endure to be the otherâs slave.


82. As many as are those who know a manâs secret, so many are his anxieties: therefore one should not disclose a secret.

 âBrahmadatta of PaÃ±cÄla has come with all his host; this army of PaÃ±cÄla is infinite, O Mahosadha!


85-86. Men with burdens on their backs,

 foot-soldiers, men skilful in fight, men ready to destroy, a great din, the noise of drums and conchs, here is all skill in the use of steel weapons, here are banners and knights in mail, accomplished warriors and heroes!


87. Ten sages are here, profound in wisdom, secret in stratagem, and eleventh, the mother of the king 
To explain this, the commentator tells the following story: Amongst those wise men the kingâs mother, they say, was still more wise. One day a man set out to cross over a river, holding a bundle of husked rice, a meal of boiled rice wrapped in a leaf, and a thousand rupees. When he came to the mid-river he could get no further, and so he called out to the men on the bank: âSee, I have in my hand a bundle of husked rice, a leaf of boiled rice, and a thousand rupees; I will give whichever of these I like if anthate will take me across.â Then a strong man girt up his loins and dived in, caught the man by the hands and pulled him across. âNow,â said he, âgive me my due.â âYou may have the husked rice or the boiled rice,â said the man. 
{398}
 âWhat!â said he, âI saved you without thinking of my own life! That is not what I want: give me the money.â âI told you that I would give you what I liked, and now what I like I give you. Take it if you will.â The other told a bystander, and he also said, âThe man gives you what he likes; then take it.â âNot I!â said the other, and complained before the judges of court. They all said the same. The man discontented with this sentence complained to the king, who sent 
[203]
 for the judges and heard both sides, and knowing no better decision gave it against the man who had risked his life. At this moment the kingâs mother, Queen TalatÄ, who sat near, hearing the kingâs mistaken award, asked him if he had carefully considered his sentence. He replied, âMother, that is the best I can do; decide it better if you can.â âAnd so I will,â said she. Then she said to the man: âFriend, put down on the ground the three things which you held in your hand; put them in order. And tell me, when you were in the water what did you say?â He told her. âNow then,â said she, âtake which you like.â He took up the money. As he began to go away she asked him, âSo you like the money?â âYes.â âAnd did you, or did you not say to the man, that you would give him what you liked?â âYes, I did say so.â âThen you must give him the money.â He gave it weeping and wailing. Then king and courtiers applauded in great delight; and after this her wisdom became noised abroad everywhere.

94. Let them utter gentle words which shall give pleasure, and let the people of PaÃ±cÄla and Videha be as one.â

95. âHow did your meeting with Mahosadha come off, Kevaá¹­á¹­a? Pray tell me that. Was Mahosadha reconciled, was he pleased?â

96. âHe is a man ignoble of nature, lord of men! Disagreeable, obstinate, wicked in disposition, like one dumb or deaf: he said not a word.â

99. âDo you know, great king: mighty and strong is king Cullaá¹Ä« Brahmadatta, and he wants you to kill, as a hunter catches the deer by decoy.


100-101. As a fish greedy for food does not recognize the hook hidden in the bait, or a mortal his death, so you O king, greedy in desire, do not recognize Cullaá¹Ä«âs daughter, you, mortal, your own death.


102. Go to PaÃ±cÄla, and in a little time you will destroy yourself, as a deer caught on the road comes into great danger.â
 [6.215] {6.417}

103. âI was foolish, I was deaf and dumb, to consult you on high matters. How can you understand things like other men, when you grew up hanging on to the plow-tail?â

104. âTake this fellow by the neck and rid my kingdom of him, who speaks to hinder my getting a jewel.â

105. âThen he went out of Vedehaâs presence, and spake to his messenger, MÄá¹­hara, the clever parrot:


106-107. Come, my green parrot, do a service for me. The king of PaÃ±cÄla has a mynah that watches his bed: ask him in full, for he knows all, knows all the secrets of the king and Kosiya.


108. MÄá¹­hara the clever parrot listened, and went â the green parrot â to the mynah bird.


109. Then this clever parrot MÄá¹­hara spake to the sweet-voiced mynah in her fine cage:

 {6.421}

116. âParrot should love parrot, and mynah love mynah: how can there be union between parrot and mynah?â

121. âNo luck for the hasty, O wise parrot MÄá¹­hara. Stay here until you shall see the king, and hear the sound of tabours and see the splendour of our king.â

136. âWelcome are you, Vedeha, a good coming is thine! Enquire now for a lucky hour, and I will give you my daughter, full of grace, attended by her handmaidens.â

145. âWarrior, you are careless, neglectful of advice, unwise: now let your clever advisers save you.


146. A king who will not do the bidding of a wise and faithful counsellor, being bent on his own pleasure, is like a deer caught in a trap.


147. As a fish, greedy for the bait, does not notice the hook hidden in the meat which is wrapped round it, does not recognise its own death:


148. So you, O king, greedy with lust, like the fish, do not recognise Cullaá¹Ä«âs daughter as your own death.


149. If you go to PaÃ±cÄla, (I said,) you will speedily lose your happiness, as a deer caught on the highway will fall into great danger.


150. A bad man, my lord, would bite you like a snake in your lap; no wise man should make friends with him; unhappy must be the association with an evil man. 
{6.438}


151. Whatsoever man, my lord; one should recognise for virtuous and instructed, he is the man for the wise to make his friend: happy would be the association with a good man.â

152. âFoolish you are, O king, deaf and dumb, that did upbraid my best advice, asking how I could know what was good like another, when I had grown up at the plow-tail?


153. Take that fellow by the neck, you said, and cast him out of my kingdom, who tries by his talk to keep me from getting a precious thing!â 
See p. 215 above.
 [6.227]

154. âMahosadha, the wise do not throw up the past in oneâs teeth; why do you goad me like a horse tied fast?


155. If you see deliverance or safety, comfort me: why throw up the past against me?â

156. â âTis too late for men to act, too hard and difficult: I cannot deliver you, and you must decide for yourself.


157. There are elephants which can fly through the air, having Powers, glorious: they that possess such as these can go away with them.

159. Birds there are which can fly through the air, having Powers, glorious: they that possess such as these can go away with them.


160. Yakkhas there are which can fly through the air, having Powers, glorious: they that possess such as these can go away with them.


161. But it is too late for men to act, too hard and difficult: I cannot save you, and you must decide for yourself.â

162. âA man who cannot see the shore in the mighty ocean, when he finds a footing is full of joy.


163. So to us and the king you, Mahosadha, are firm ground to stand on; you are our best of counsellors; deliver us from woe.â

164. â âTis too late for men to act, too hard and difficult: I cannot deliver you, and you must decide for yourself, Senaka.â

165. âHear this word of mine: you see this great danger, and now Senaka, I ask you â what do you think ought to be done here?â
 {6.441}

166. âLet us set fire to the door, let us take a sword, let us wound one another, and soon we shall cease to live: let not Brahmadatta kill us slowly with a lingering death.â
 [6.228]

167. âHear this word: you see this great danger. Now I ask Pukkusa â what do you think ought to be done here?


168. Let us take poison and die, and we shall soon cease to live: let not Brahmadatta kill us slowly with a lingering death.


169-171. Now I ask KÄvinda. Let us fasten a noose and die, let us cast ourselves from a height, let not Brahmadatta kill us slowly with a lingering death. Now I ask Devinda.


172. Let us set fire to the door, let us take a sword, let us wound one another, and soon we shall cease to live: I cannot save us, but Mahosadha can do so easily.â

173. âThis is my meaning, sire: Let us all ask the wise man; and if for all our asking Mahosadha cannot easily save us, then let us follow Senakaâs advice.â

174-175. âAs one that searches for sap in the plantain tree or the silk-cotton tree, finds none; so we searching for an answer to this problem have found none.


176. Our dwelling is in a bad place, like elephants in a place where no water is, with worthless men and fools that know nothing.


177. My heart throbs, my mouth is parched, I cannot rest, I am like one burnt in the fire and then put in the sun.


178. As the smithâs fire burns inwardly and is not seen outside, so my heart burns within and is not seen outside.â

179. âThen this wise sage Mahosadha, discerning of the good, when he beheld Vedeha sorrowful thus spake to him:


180-185. âFear not, O king, fear not, lord of chariots; I will set you free, like the moon when it is caught by RÄhu, like the sun when it is caught by RÄhu, like an elephant sunk in the mud, like a snake shut up in a basket, like fish in the net.


186. I will set you free with your chariots and your army; I will scare away PaÃ±cÄla, as a crow is scared by a clod.


187. Of what use indeed is the wisdom or the counsellor of such a kind as cannot set you free from trouble when you are in difficulties?â â

188. âCome, men, up and open the mouth of the entrance: Vedeha with his court is to go through the tunnel.â
 [6.229]

189. âHearing the wise manâs voice, his followers opened the tunnel door and the mechanical bolts.â

190. âIn front went Senaka, behind went Mahosadha, and in the midst king Vedeha with the men of his court.â

191. âVedeha coming forth from the tunnel went aboard ship, and when he was aboard, Mahosadha thus encouraged him:


192. âThis is now your father-in-law, 
The brother takes the place of the absent father-in-law, according to the commentator.
 my 
[6.230]
 lord, this is your mother-in-law, O master of men: as you would treat your mother, so treat your mother-in-law.


193. As a brother by the same father and mother, so protect PaÃ±cÄlacaá¹á¸a, O lord of chariots.


194. PaÃ±cÄlacaá¹á¸Ä« is a royal princess, much wooed; 
abhijjhitÄ
.
 love her, she is your wife, O lord of chariots.â â
 {6.446}

195. âCome aboard with speed: why do you stand on the bank? From danger and trouble we have been delivered; now, Mahosadha, let us go.â

196. âThis is not right, sire, that I, the leader of an army, should desert my army and come myself.


197. All this army, left behind in the town, I will bring away with the consent of Brahmadatta.â

198. âA small army against a great, how will you prevail? The weak will be destroyed by the strong, wise sir!â
 {6.447}

199. âA small army with counsel conquers a large army that has none, one king conquers many, the rising sun conquers the darkness.â

200. âHappiness truly comes, O Senaka, by living with the wise. As birds from a closed cage, as fish from a net, so Mahosadha set us free when we were in the hands of my enemies.â

201. âEven so, sire, there is happiness amongst the wise. As birds from a closed cage, as fish from a net, so Mahosadha set us free when we were in the hands of our enemies.â
 [6.231]

202. âThe mighty Cullaá¹Ä« watched all night, and at sunrise approached UpakÄrÄ«.


203-204. Mounting his noble elephant, strong, sixty years old, Cullaá¹Ä«, mighty king of PaÃ±cÄla, addressed his army; fully armed with jewelled harness, an arrow 
The text 
gharam ÄdÄya pÄá¹inaá¹

pÄá¹inaá¹

 in his hand, he addressed his men collected in great numbers.â

205. âMen mounted on elephants, lifeguardsmen, charioteers, footmen, men skilful in archery, bowmen, all gathered together.â

206. âSend the tusked elephants, mighty, sixty years old, let them trample down the city which Vedeha has nobly built.


207. Let the arrows 
senÄ =
 arrows, as fitted with hawkâs feathers.
 fly this way and that way, sped by the bow, arrows like the teeth of calves, 
i.e. white or shining.
 sharp-pointed, piercing the very bones.


208. Let heroes come forth in armour clad, with weapons finely decorated, bold and heroic, ready to face an elephant.


209. Spears bathed in oil, their points glittering like fire, stand gleaming like the constellation of a hundred stars. 
{6.449}


210. At the onset of such heroes, with mighty weapons, clad in mail and armour, who never run away, how shall Vedeha escape, even if he fly like a bird?


211. My thirty and nine thousand 
So the commentator and the Sinhalese version both interpret 
tiá¹sÄâ¦ nÄvutyo.
 warriors, all picked men, whose like I never saw, all my mighty host.


212. See the mighty tusked elephants, caparisoned, of sixty years, on whose backs are the brilliant and goodly princes.


213-215. Brilliant are they on their backs, as the Devaputtas in Nandana, with glorious ornaments, glorious dress and robes: swords of the colour of the sheat-fish, 
Silurus Boalis.
 well oiled, glittering, held fast by mighty men, well-finished, very sharp, shining, spotless, made of tempered steel, 
sikÄyasamayÄ:
 â
sattavÄre koÃ±casakuá¹e khÄdÄpetvÄ gahitena sikÄyasena katÄ
.â The Sinhalese version explains it as follows: âSteel was obtained by burning the excrement of Koslihiá¹iyas, which had been fed on flesh mixed with steel dust got from
 [232]
 the filings of JÄti steel. The steel obtained from the excrement was again filed and mixed with flesh as before and given to the birds. And so the process was seven times repeated. From the steel obtained from the seventh burning the swords were made.â
 strong, 
[6.232]
 held by mighty men who strike and strike again.


216. In golden trappings and blood-red girths they gleam as they turn like lightning in a thick cloud.


217-218. Mailed heroes with banners waving, skilled in the use of sword and shield, grasping the hilt, accomplished soldiers, mighty fighters on elephant-back, encompassed by such as these you have no escape; I see no power by which you can come to MithilÄ.â
 {6.450}

219. âWhy have you driven up your elephant thus in haste? You come with a glad look; you think that you have got what you want.


220. Throw down that bow, put away that arrow, put off that shining armour set with jewels and coral.â

221. âYour countenance looks pleased, you speak with a smile. It is in the hour of death that such beauty is seen.â

222. âYour thunders are in vain, O king! Your plan is thwarted, man of war! The king is as hard for you to catch as a thoroughbred for a hack.


223. Our king crossed the Ganges yesterday, with his courtiers and attendants. You will be like a crow trying to chase the royal goose.â

224. âJackals, in the night time, seeing the Flame of the Forest in flower, think the flowers to be lumps of meat, 
See Ja 248 
Kiá¹sukopamajÄtaka
.
 and gather in troops, these vilest of beasts.


225. When the watches of the night are past, and the sun has risen, they see the Flame of the Forest in flower, and lose their wish, those vilest of beasts.


226. Even so you, O king, for all that you have surrounded Vedeha, shall lose your wish and go, as the jackals went from the Flame of the Forest.â

227-228. âCut off his hands and feet, ears and nose, for he delivered Vedeha my enemy from my hands; cut off his flesh and cook it on skewers, for he delivered Vedeha my enemy out of my hands.


229-230. As a bullâs hide is spread out on the ground, or a lionâs or tigerâs fastened flat with pegs, so I will peg him out and pierce him with spikes, for he delivered Vedeha my enemy out of my hand.â

231-234. âIf you cut off my hands and feet, my ears and nose, so will Vedeha deal with PaÃ±cÄlacaá¹á¸a, so with PaÃ±cÄlacaá¹á¸Ä«, so with queen NandÄ, your wife and children. 
{6.454}


235-238. If you cut off my flesh and cook it on skewers, so will Vedeha cook that of PaÃ±cÄlacaá¹á¸a, of PaÃ±cÄlacaá¹á¸Ä«, of queen NandÄ, your wife and children.


239-242. If you peg me out and pierce me with spikes, so will Vedeha deal with PaÃ±cÄlacaá¹á¸a, with PaÃ±cÄlacaá¹á¸Ä«, with queen NandÄ, your wife and children. So it has been secretly arranged between Vedeha and me.


243. Like as a leather shield of a hundred layers, carefully wrought by the leather-workers, is a defence to keep off arrows.


244. So I bring happiness and avert trouble from glorious Vedeha, and I keep off your devices as a shield keeps off an arrow.â
 {6.455}

245. âCome, sire, see your inner apartments are empty: wife, children, mother, O warrior, were carried through a tunnel and put in charge of Vedeha.â

246. âCome, enter my inner apartments and enquire whether the manâs words be truth or lies.â

247. âEven so, sire, as Mahosadha said: empty is your inner palace, like a waterside village inhabited by crows.â

248. âThis way, sire, went the woman beauteous in every limb, her lips like plates of gold, her voice like the music of the wild goose.


249. This way was she taken, sire, the woman beauteous in every limb, clad in silken raiment, dark, with fair girdle of gold.


250. Her feet reddened, fair to see, with girdles of gold and jewels, with eyes like a pigeon, slender, with lips like bimba fruit, and slender 
[6.235]
 waist.


251-252. Well-born, slender-waisted like a creeper or a place of sacrifice, 
velli
, the ground being raised and narrow in the middle.
 her hair long, black, and a little curled at the end, well-born, like a fawn, like a flame of fire in winter time. Like a river hidden in the clefts of a mountain under the low reeds. 
{6.457}


253. Beauteous in nose or thigh, peerless, with breasts like the tindook fruit, not too long, not too short, not hairless and not too hairy.â

254. âAnd so you are pleased at NandÄâs death, glorious king: now NandÄ and I will go before Yama.â
 {6.458}

255. âDo you study the magical arts, or have you bewitched my eyes, that you have delivered Vedeha my enemy out of my hand?â

256. Wise men, sire, learn magic in this world; they deliver themselves, wise men, full of counsel.


257. I have young men who are clever at breaking barriers; by the way which they made for me Vedeha has gone to MithilÄ.â
 {6.459}

258. âCome see, O king, a tunnel well made, big enough for elephants or horses, chariots or foot soldiers, brightly illuminated, a tunnel well built.â
 [6.236]

259. âNo small gain is it to that Vedeha, who has in his house or kingdom men so wise as you are, Mahosadha!â 
cp. p. 178 above.
 {6.460}

260. âSupport, and honour, double allowance of food and wages, and other great boons I give; eat and enjoy at will: but do not return to Vedeha; what can he do for you?â
 {6.462}

261. âWhen one deserts a patron, sire, for the sake of gain, it is a disgrace to both oneself and the other.


262. While Vedeha lives I could not be anotherâs man; while Vedeha remains, I could not live in anotherâs kingdom.â

263. âI give you a thousand nikkhas of gold, eighty villages in KÄsi, four hundred female slaves, and a hundred wives. Take all your army, and go in peace, Mahosadha.â

264. âLet them give even double quantity to the elephants and horses, let them content charioteers and footmen with food and drink.â

265. âGo; wise sir, taking elephants, horses, chariots, and footmen; let king Vedeha see you back in MithilÄ.â

266. âElephants, horses, chariots, footmen, a great army is visible, with four divisions, terrible in aspect; what does it mean, wise sirs?â

267. âThe greatest joy is what you see, sire: Mahosadha is safe, with all his host.â

268. âAs four men leave a corpse in the cemetery, so we left you in the kingdom of Kampilliya and returned.


269. But you â by what colour, or what means, or what device did you save yourself?â

270. âBy one purpose, Vedeha, I overmastered another, by plan I outdid plan, O warrior, and I encompassed the king as the ocean encompasses JambudÄ«pa.â
 [6.239]

271. âA thousand nikkhas of gold were given to me, and eighty villages in KÄsi, four hundred slave women, and a hundred wives, and with all the army I have returned safe home.â

272. âHappiness truly comes by living with the wise. As birds from a closed cage, as fish from a net, so Mahosadha set us free when we were in the hands of our enemies.â

273. âEven so, sire, there is happiness with a wise man. As birds from a closed cage, as fish from the net, so Mahosadha set us free when we were in the hands of our enemies.â

274. âLet them sound all manner of lutes, drums and tabors, let conchs of Magadha boom, merrily roll the kettledrums.â

275. âWomen and maids, vesiya and brahmin wives, brought plenty of food and drink to the sage.


276-277. Elephant drivers, lifeguardsmen, charioteers, footmen, all did the like; and so did all the people from country and villages assembled.


278. The multitude were glad to see the sage returned, and at his reception shawls were waved in the air.â
 {6.466}

279. âIf there were seven of you voyaging on the ocean, and a Yakkha seeking for a human sacrifice should seize the ship, in what order would you give them up and save yourself from the Water Rakkhasa?â
 {6.470}

280. âFirst I would give my mother, next my wife, next my brother, fourth my friend, fifth my brahmin, sixth myself, but I would not give up Mahosadha.â

281. âShe reared you and she brought you forth, and for a long time was kind to you, when ChambhÄ« offended against you she was wise and saw what was for your good, and by putting a counterfeit in your place she saved you from harm.


282. Such a mother, who gave you life, your own mother who bore you in her womb, for what fault could you give her to the Water Rakkhasa?â 
Cullaá¹Ä«âs father was named MahÄcullaá¹Ä«; and when the child was young, the mother committed adultery with the chaplain ChambhÄ«, then poisoned her husband and made the brahmin king in his place, and became his queen. One day 
[243]
 the boy said he was hungry, and she gave him molasses to eat: but flies swarmed about it, so the boy, to get rid of the flies, dropped some upon the ground and drove away those that were near him. The flies flew away and settled on the molasses that was on the ground. So he ate his sweetmeat, washed his hands, rinsed his mouth, and went away. But the brahmin, seeing this, thought: âIf he has found out this way of getting rid of the flies, when he grows up he will take the kingdom from me; so I will kill him now.â He told Queen TalatÄ, and she said, âVery good, my lord; I killed my husband for love of you, and what is the boy to me? But let us kill him secretly.â So she deceived the brahmin. But being clever and skilful she hit on a plan. Sending
 [243]
 for the cook, she said to him, âFriend, my son prince Cullaá¹Ä« and your son young Dhanusekha were born on one day, they have grown up together in friendship. The brahmin ChambhÄ« wants to kill my son; I pray thee save his life!â He was willing, and asked how. âLet my son,â she said, âbe often in your house; you and he must both sleep in the great kitchen for several days to avoid suspicion. When all is safe, put a heap of sheepâs bones in the place where you lie, and at the time when men go to sleep, set fire to the kitchen, and without a word to anthate take my son and yours, go out by the house door, and go to another country, and protect my sonâs life without letting anthate know that he is a prince.â He promised, and she gave him a quantity of treasure. He did as she bade, and went with the boy to the city of SÄgala in the Madda kingdom, where he served the king: he dismissed his former cook and took his place. The two boys used to go to the palace with him. The king asked whose sons they were; the cook said they were his. âSurely they are not alike!â said the king. âThey had different mothers,â he said. As time went on they played about in the palace with the kingâs daughter. Then Cullaá¹Ä« and the princess, from seeing each other constantly, fell in love. In the playroom, the prince used to make the princess fetch his ball or dice; if she would not, he hit her on the head and made her cry; the king hearing her cry asked who had done it, and the nurses would come to enquire; but the princess thought: âIf I say he did it, my father will play the king over him,â and for love of him she would not tell, but said no one had struck her. But one day the king saw him do it; and he thought: âThis lad is not like the cook, he is handsome and attractive and very fearless; he cannot be his son.â So after that he showed favour to the lad. The nurses used to bring food for the princess in the playroom, and she gave some to the other children; they used to go down on their knees to take it, but prince Cullaá¹Ä« without stopping his play put out his hand for it as he stood. The king saw this. One day, Cullaá¹Ä«âs ball ran under the kingâs little couch. The lad went to get it, but in pride of his own majesty 
{472}
 pulled it out with a stick, that he might not bend under the bed of a foreign king. When the king saw this, he felt sure that the lad was no cookâs son; so he sent for the cook, and asked him whose son he was. âMine, my lord,â he said. âI know who is your son and who is not; tell me the truth â if you do not, you are a dead man,â and he drew his sword. The cook, terrified out of his wits, said, âMy lord, I will tell you, but I ask you for secrecy.â The king granted his request, and promised immunity. Then he told the truth. Then the king adorned his daughter, and gave her to the lad for his handmaiden. Now on the day when these ran away, there was a great outcry throughout the city, âThe cook and his son and prince Cullaá¹Ä« are burnt up in the kitchen!â Queen TalatÄ, hearing it, told the brahmin that his wish had been fulfilled, and they were all three burnt up in the kitchen. He was highly pleased, and Queen TalatÄ, showing him the goatâs bones as prince Cullaá¹Ä«âs, had them burnt.
 [6.243] {6.472}

283-284. âLike a young girl she wears ornaments which she ought not to use, she mocks unseasonably at doorkeepers and guards, unbidden she sends messages to rival kings; and for these faults I would give her to the Water Rakkhasa.â
 [6.244] {6.473}

285-286. âShe is chief amongst womankind, she is exceedingly gracious of speech, devoted, virtuous, who cleaves to you like your shadow, not given to anger, prudent, wise, who sees your good: for what fault would you give your wife to the Water Rakkhasa?â

287. âBy her sensual attractions she has made me subject to evil influence, and asks what she should not for her sons.


288. In my passion I give her many and many a gift; I relinquish what is very hard to give, and afterwards I bitterly repent: for that fault I would give my wife to the Water Rakkhasa.â

289-290. âHe who gave prosperity to the people, and when you were living in foreign parts brought you back home, he whom great wealth could not influence, peerless bowman and hero, Tikhiá¹amantÄ«: for what fault would you give your brother to the Water Rakkhasa?â 
He was born while his mother lived with the brahmin. When he grew up, the brahmin put a sword in his hand, told him to take it and stand by him. He, thinking that the brahmin was his father, did so. But one of the courtiers told him that he was not that manâs son. âWhen you were in your motherâs womb,â said he, âQueen TalatÄ murdered the king and made this man king instead; you are the son of king MahÄCullaá¹Ä«.â He was angry, and determined to find a way to kill the brahmin. He entered the palace, and gave the sword to one servant, and then said to another, âMake a brawl at the palace gate, and declare that this sword is yours.â Then he went in, and they began brawling. The prince sent a messenger to enquire what the noise was. He returned and said it was a quarrel about the sword. The brahmin hearing it asked, what sword? The prince said, âIs the sword which you gave me anotherâs property?â âWhat have you said, my son!â âWell, shall I send for it? Will you recognize it?â He sent for it, and, drawing it from the scabbard, said, âLook at itâ; on pretence of showing it to the brahmin he went up to him, and with one blow cut off his head, which dropped at his feet. Then he cleansed the palace, and decorated the city, and was proclaimed king. Then his mother told him how prince Cullaá¹Ä« was living in Madda; whereupon the prince went thither with an army and brought back his brother and made him king.

291. âHe thinks: âI gave prosperity to the people, I brought him back home when he was living in foreign parts, great wealth could not influence me.


292. I am a peerless bowman and hero, and sharp in counsel, by me he was made king.â


293. He does not come to wait on me, madam, as he used to do; that is the fault for which I would give my brother to the Water Rakkhasa.â
 {6.475}

294. âIn one night both you and Dhanusekha were born here, both called PaÃ±cÄla, friends and companions:


285. Through all your life he has followed you, your joy and pain were his, zealous and careful by night and day in all service: for what fault would you give your friend to the Water Rakkhasa?â
 [6.245]

286. âMadam, through all my life he used to make merry with me, and today also he makes free excessively for the same reason.


287. If I talk in secret with my wife, in he comes unbidden and unannounced.


288. Give him a chance and an opening, he acts shamelessly and disrespectfully. That is the fault for which I would give my friend to the Water Rakkhasa.â

289-290. âHe is clever, knows all omens and sounds, skilled in signs and dreams, goings out and comings in, 
{6.476}
 understands all the tokens in earth and air and stars: for what fault would you give the brahmin to the Water Rakkhasa?â

291. âEven in company he stares at me with open eyes; therefore I would give this rascal with his puckered brows to the Water Rakkhasa.â

292-293. âSire, you dwell amidst your courtiers in a great continent surrounded by the sea, with the ocean in place of an encircling wall: lord of the earth, with a mighty empire, victorious, sole emperor, your glory has become great.


294. You have sixteen thousand women dressed in jewels and ornaments, women of all nations, resplendent like DevakaÃ±Ã±Äs.


295. Thus provided for every need, every desire fulfilled, you have lived long in happiness and bliss.


296. Then by what reason or what cause do you sacrifice your precious life to protect the sage?â
 {6.477}

297. âSince Mahosadha, madam, came to me, I have not seen the steadfast man do the most trifling wrong.


298. If I should die before him at any time, he would bring happiness to my sons and grandsons.


299. He knows all things, past or future. This man without wrong I would not give to the Water Rakkhasa.â

300. âHear this, men of PaÃ±cÄla, which Cullaá¹Ä« has said. To protect the wise man he sacrifices his own precious life. 
{6.478}


301. His motherâs life, his wifeâs and his brotherâs, his friendâs life and his own, PaÃ±cÄla is ready to sacrifice.


302. So marvellous is the power of wisdom, so clever and so intelligent, for good in this world and for happiness in the next.â
 [6.246]

This is the identification of the JÄtaka,

âUppalavaá¹á¹Ä« was BherÄ«, Suddhodana was the wise manâs father,

MahÄmÄyÄ his mother, the beautiful BimbÄ was AmarÄ,


Änanda was the parrot, SÄriputta was Cullaá¹Ä«,

Mahosadha was the lord of the world: thus understand the JÄtaka.


Devadatta was Kevaá¹­á¹­a, CullanandikÄ was TalatÄ,

SundarÄ« was PaÃ±cÄlacaá¹á¸Ä«, YasassikÄ was the queen,


Ambaá¹­á¹­ha was KÄvinda, Poá¹­á¹­hapÄda was Pukkusa,

Pilotika was Devinda, Saccaka was Senaka,


Diá¹­á¹­hamangalikÄ was queen UdumbarÄ,

Kuá¹á¸alÄ« was the mynah bird, and LÄá¸·udÄyÄ« was Vedeha.â

In the present when the Buddha returns to his kinsmen they do not want to pay respects to him as he is younger than they are. He then tells a story of a prince who was so generous he was sent into exile by the people, even there he gave away all he had, including his children and his wife. Recognising his virtue the people call him back to be their king. Sakka provides the king with a ready supply of gifts to be given away.

## Full Story
âTen boons.â
 {6.479}
 This story the Teacher told while dwelling near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Grove, about a shower of rain.


When the Teacher turned the precious Wheel of the Dhamma and came in due course to RÄjagaha, where he spent the winter, with elder UdÄyi leading the way, and attended by twenty thousand saints, he entered Kapilavatthu: whereupon the Sakya princes gathered together to see the chief of their clan. They inspected the Fortunate Oneâs abode, saying: âA delightful place this Banyan Grove, worthy of Sakka.â Then they made all due provision for guarding it; and making ready to meet him with fragrant posies in their hands, they sent first all the youngest boys and girls of the township dressed in their best, next the princes and princesses, and amongst these themselves did honour to the Teacher with fragrant flowers and powders, escorting the Fortunate One as far as the Banyan Park; where the Fortunate One took his seat, surrounded by twenty thousand saints upon the Buddhaâs goodly seat, which was appointed for him.


Now the SÄkiyas are a proud and stiff-necked race; and they, thinking within themselves: âPrince Siddhattha is younger than we; he is our younger brother, our nephew, our grandson,â said to the younger princes, âYou do him obeisance; we will sit behind you.â As they sat there without doing obeisance to him, the Fortunate One, perceiving their intent, thought to himself, âMy kinsfolk do me no obeisance; well, I will make them do so.â So he caused to arise in him that Absorption which is based on the Super Knowledges, rose up into the air, and as though shaking off the dust of his feet upon their heads, performed a miracle like the twofold miracle at the foot of the knot-mango tree. 
[See Ja 483 
SarabhamigajÄtaka
.]
 The king, seeing this wonder, said: âSir, on the day of your birth, when I saw your feet placed upon the head of brahmin KÄladevala who had come to do you obeisance, I did obeisance to you, and that was the first time. On the day of the Plowing Festival, when you sat on the royal seat under the shade of a Jambu plum tree, 
[6.247]
 when I saw that the shadow of the tree moved not, I did obeisance to your feet; and that was the second time. And now again, I see a miracle which I never saw before, and do obeisance to your feet, this is the third time.â But when the king had thus done obeisance, not one SÄkiya could sit still and refrain, they did obeisance one and all.


The Fortunate One, having thus made his kinsfolk do obeisance to him, came down from the air and sat upon the appointed seat; when the Fortunate One was there seated, his kinsfolk were made wise, and sat with peace in their hearts. Then a great cloud arose, and burst into a shower of rain: down came the rain red and with a loud noise, and those who desired to be wet were wetted, 
{6.480}
 but he who did not, had not even a drop fell upon his body. All who saw it were astonished at the miracle, and cried one to another, âLo, a marvel! Lo, a miracle! Lo, the power of the Buddhas, on whose kinsfolk such a shower of rain is falling!â On hearing this, the Buddha said: âThis is not the first time, monks, that a great shower of rain has fallen upon my kinsfolk,â and then, at their request, he told a story of the past.

Samaá¹Ä«, Samaá¹Ä, the holy sister GuttÄ,

BhikkhudÄsikÄ, and DhammÄ and SudhammÄ,

And of the sisters the seventh Saá¹ghadÄsÄ«.

KhemÄ, Uppalavaá¹á¹Ä, the third was Paá¹­ÄcÄrÄ,

GotamÄ, DhammadinnÄ, and sixthly MahÄmÄyÄ,

And of this band of sisters the seventh was VisÄkhÄ.

1. âTen boons I give you, PhusatÄ«, O beauteous lady bright:

Choose you whatever on the earth is precious in your sight.â 
{6.482}

2. âGlory to you, O king of gods! What wrong is done by me,

To send me from this lovely place as winds blow down a tree?â

3. âDear are you still as you have been, and wrong you have not done:

I speak because your merit now is all used up and gone.


4. Now your departure is at hand, the hour of death draws nigh:

Ten boons I offer you to choose; then choose, before you die.â
 [6.249]

5. âKing Sakka, lord of beings all, a boon hath granted me:

I bless him: craving that my life in Siviâs realm may be.


6. Black eyes, black pupils like a fawn, black eyebrows may I have,

And PhusatÄ« my name: this boon, O bounteous one, I crave.


7. A son be mine, revered by kings, famed, glorious, debonair,

Bounteous, ungrudging, one to lend a ready ear to prayer.


8. And while the babe is in my womb let not my figure go,

Let it be slim and graceful like a finely fashioned bow.
 {6.483}


9. Still, Sakka, may my breasts be firm, nor white-haired may I be; 
Reading

 cf. the Sinhalese version, p. 7: âgrant that my hair may not whiten.â

My body all unblemished, may I set the death-doomed free. 
I.e. may I be fair enough to keep my influence over the king.


10. Mid heronsâ cries, and peacocksâ calls, with waiting women fair,

Poets and bards to sing our praise, shawls waving in the air,

 âwaving of cloths in token of joy.â The next compound I translate as though it were

 seems to contain

11. When rattling on the painted door the menial calls aloud,

God bless king Sivi! Come to meat! Be I his queen avowed.â

12. âKnow that these boons, my lady bright, which I have granted you,

In Sivi kingdom, beauteous one, all ten fulfilled shall be. 
{6.484}


13. So spake the monarch of the gods, the great Sujampati,

Called VÄsava, well pleased to grant a boon to PhusatÄ«.â

14. âNext born a princess, PhusatÄ« was to the city led,

Jetuttara, and there anon to SaÃ±jaya was wed.â 
[6.250]

15. âTen months she bore me in her womb; procession then they made;

And PhusatÄ« in Vessa Street through me was brought to bed.â

16. âMy name not from the motherâs side nor from the fatherâs came;

As I was born in Vessa Street, Vessantaraâs my name.â 
[
Antara
 here has the meaning of, âin the vicinity of,â ânearâ the Vessas.]

17. âWhen I was yet a little boy, but of the age of eight,

Upon my terrace, generosity and gifts I meditate.


18. If any man should ask of me blood, body, heart, or eye,

Or blood or body, eye or heart Iâd give him, was my cry.


19. And as with all my being I pondered with thoughts like these

The unshaken earth did shake and quake with mountains, woods and trees.â 
[6.252]

20. âWith hairy armpits, hairy heads, stained teeth, and dust on poll,

O brahmins, stretching forth your hands, what is it that you crave?â

21. âWe crave a precious thing, O prince that do your people save:

That choice and saving

 elephant with tusks like any pole.â

22. âI give, and never shrink from it, that which the brahmins want,

This noble beast, for riding fit, fierce tuskÃ¨d elephant,â

23. âThe king, the saviour of his folk, dismounted from its back,

And glad in sacrificing, gave the brahmins what they lacked.â

24. âThen was a mighty terror felt, then bristling of the hair;

When the great elephant was given the earth did quake for fear.


25. Then was a mighty terror felt, then bristling of the hair;

When the great elephant was given, trembled the town for fear.


26. With a resounding mighty roar the city all did ring,

When the great elephant was given by Siviâs foster-king.â 
[6.254]

27. âUpon that loud and mighty sound, so terrible to hear,

When the great elephant was given the earth did quake for fear.


28. Upon that loud and mighty sound, so terrible to hear,

When the great elephant was given trembled the town to hear.


29. So loud and mighty was the sound all terrible did ring,

When the great elephant was given by Siviâs foster-king.â
 {6.490}

30. âThen prince and brahmin, Vesiya and Ugga, 
Ugga: a mixed caste, by a Ká¹£atriya father from a ÅÅ«dra mother. The commentator, however, explains the word by 
uggatÄ paÃ±Ã±ÄtÄ,

 great and small,

Mahouts and footmen, charioteers and soldiers, one and all,


31. The country landowners, and all the Sivi folk come by.

Seeing the elephant depart, thus to the king did cry:


32. âYour realm is ruined, sire: why should Vessantara your son

Thus give away our elephant revered by every one?


33. Why give our saviour elephant, pole-tuskÃ¨d, goodly, white,

Which ever knew the vantage-ground to choose in every fight?


34. With jewels and his yak-tail fan; which trampled down all foes;

Long-tuskÃ¨d, furious, white as Mount KelÄsa with his snows;


35. With trappings and white parasol, fit riding for a king,

With leech and driver, he has given away this precious thing.â â

36. âWhoso bestows with food and drink, with raiment, fire and fleet,

That is a right and proper gift, for brahmins that is meet.


37. O SaÃ±jaya, your peopleâs friend, say why this thing was done

By him, a prince of our own line, Vessantara, your son?


38. The bidding of the Sivi folk if you refuse to do,

The people then will act, I think, against your son and you.â
 {6.491}

39. âYea, let my country be no more, my kingdom no more be,

Banish I will not from his realm a prince from fault quite free,

Nor will obey the peopleâs voice: my true-born son is he. 
[6.255]


40. Yea, let my country be no more, my kingdom no more be,

Banish I will not from his realm a prince from fault quite free,

Nor will obey the peopleâs voice: my very son is he.


41. No, I will work no harm on him; all noble is he still;

And it would be a shame for me, and it would cause much ill.

Vessantara, my very son, with sword how could I kill?â

42. âNot chastisement does he deserve, nor sword, nor prison cell,

But from the kingdom banish him, on Vaá¹kaâs mount to dwell.â

43. âBehold the peopleâs will! And I that will do not gainsay.

But let him bide one happy night before he go away.


44. After the space of this one night, when dawns the coming day,

Together let the people come and banish him away.â

45. âRise, fellow, go away post-haste, and tell the prince my word.

The people all, and citizens, in wrath, with one accord,


46. Uggas and princes, vesiyas and brahmins too, my son,

Mahouts and lifeguards, charioteers, and footmen, every one,

All citizens, all country folk, together here have run,


47. After the space of this one night, when dawns the coming day,

They will assemble one and all and banish you away.


48. This fellow sent by Siviâs king swift on his errand pressed,

Upon an armed elephant, perfumed, and finely dressed,


49. Head bathed in water, jewelled rings in ears, and on he rode

Till to that lovely town he came, Vessantaraâs abode.


50. Then he beheld the happy prince abiding in his land,

Like VÄsava the king of gods; round him the courtiers stand.


51. There in haste the fellow went, and to the prince said he:

âI bear ill tidings, royal sir: be not angry with me!â


52. With due obeisance, weeping sore, he said unto the king:

âYou are my master, sire, and you do give me every thing:

Bad news I have to tell you now: do you some comfort bring.


53. The people all and citizens, in wrath, with one consent,

Uggas and princes, vesiyas and brahmins, all are bent,


54. Mahouts and lifeguards, charioteers, the footmen every one,

All citizens and country folk together now have run,


55. After the space of this one night, when dawns the coming day,

Determined all to come in crowds and banish you away.â â

56. âWhy are people angry with me? For no offence I see.

Tell me, good fellow, wherefore pray they wish to banish me?â 
[6.256] {6.493}

57. âUggas and vesiyas, charioteers, and brahmins every one,

Mahouts and lifeguards, charioteers and footmen, there run,

All angry at your giving gifts, and therefore banish you.â

58. âMy very eye and heart Iâd give: why not what is not mine,

Or gold or treasure, precious stones, or pearls, or jewels fine?


59. Comes any one to ask of me, Iâd give my hand, my right, 
Reading

Nor for a moment hesitate: in gifts is my delight.


60. Now let the people banish me, now let the people kill,

Or cut me sevenfold, for cease from gifts I never will.â

61. âThis is the Sivi peopleâs will; they bade me tell you so:

Where KontimÄrÄ by the hill ÄraÃ±jara does flow,

There depart, where banished men, good sir, are wont to go.â

62. âSo I by that same road shall go as they who do offend:

But first to make a gift, one night and day I pray them lend.â

63. âThus did the king to MaddÄ« speak, that lady passing fair:

âAll that I ever gave to you, or goods or grain, beware,


64. Or gold or treasure, precious stones, and plenty more beside,

Your fatherâs dower, find a place this treasure all to hide.


65. Then out spake MaddÄ« to the king, that princess passing fair:

Where shall I find a place, my lord, to hide it? Tell me where?â â
 [6.257]

66. âIn due proportion on the good your wealth in gifts bestow,

No other place than this is safe to keep it, well I know.â 
{6.495}

67. âBe kind, O MaddÄ«, to your sons, your husbandâs parents both,

To him who will your husband be do service, nothing loth.


68. And if no man should wish to be your husband, when Iâm gone,

Go seek a husband for thyself, but do not pine alone.â

69. âTomorrow to a forest drear, beset with beasts of prey,

I go: and whether I can live within it, who can say?â


70. Then spake the princess MaddÄ«, spake the lady passing fair:

âIt is not so! A wicked word! To say it do not dare!


71. It is not meet and right, my king, that you alone should fare:

Whatever journey you shall go, I also will be there.


72. Give me the choice to die with you, or live from you apart,

Death is my choice, unless I can live with you where you art.


73. Kindle a blazing fiery flame the fiercest that can be,

There I would rather die the death than live apart from thee.
 {6.496}


74. As close behind an elephant his mate is often found

Moving through mountain pass or wood, oâer rough or level ground,


75. So with my boys Iâll follow you, wherever you may lead,

Nor shall you find me burdensome or difficult to feed.â 
The last two verses are repeated, with a difference, from v. 259
21-4
, translation v. p. 133.

76. âWhen you shall see your pretty boys, and hear their prattle ring

Under the greenwood, youâll forget that ever you were king.


77. To see your pretty boys at play, and hear their prattle ring

Under the greenwood, youâll forget that ever you were king.

In our fair home, you will forget that ever you were king.


84. The elephant of sixty years, all lonely wandering

The woodland, will make you forget that ever you were king.


85. The elephant of sixty years, at even wandering

And early, will make you forget that ever you were king.

86. When you behold the elephant his herd of subjects bring,

To hear the sound you will forget that ever you were king.


87. The woodland glades, the roaring beasts, and every wished-for thing

When you behold, you will forget that ever you were king.


88. The deer that come at eventide, the varied flowers that spring,

The dancing Kimpurisas, you will forget that ever you were king.


89. When you shall hear the rivers roar, and the Kimpurisas sing,

Believe me, you will clean forget that ever you were king.


90. When you shall hear the screech-owlâs note in mountain cave dwelling,

Believe me, you will clean forget that ever you were king.


91. Rhinoceros and buffalo, that make the woodland ring,

Before the peahens, youâll forget that ever you were king.


95. When in the winter you behold the trees all flowering

Waft their sweet odours, youâll forget that ever you were king.


96-97. When in the winter you behold the plants all flowering,

The plants named are:

Abroad their odours, youâll forget that ever you were king.


98. When in the winter you behold the forest flowering

And blooming lotus, youâll forget that ever you were king.
 {6.498}

99. âShe heard the princess and her son, the talk that passed between,

Then bitterly she did lament, that great and glorious queen.


100. Better drink poison, better leap from off a cliff, say I,

Or better bind a strangling noose about my neck and die:

Why banish they Vessantara my unoffending son?
 [6.259]


101. So studious and free from greed, giving to all who came,

Respected by his rival kings, of great and glorious fame,

Why banish they Vessantara, my unoffending son?


102. His parentsâ prop, who did respect his elders every one,

Why banish they Vessantara, my unoffending son?


103. BelovÃ¨d by the king and queen, by all his kith and kin,

BelovÃ¨d by his friends, the realm and all that are therein,

Why banish they Vessantara, my unoffending son?â
 {6.499}

104. âLike mangoes fallen to the ground, like money waste and spent,

So falls your kingdom, if they will banish the innocent.


105. Like a wild goose with crippled wing, when all the waterâs gone,

Deserted by your courtiers, you will live in pain alone.


106. I tell you true, O mighty king: let not your good go by,

Nor banish him, the innocent, because the people cry.â

107. âYour son, the peopleâs banner, if I send to exile drear,

My royal duty I obey, than life itself more dear.â

108-111. âOnce hosts of men escorted him, with goodly banners flown,

Like forests full of flowering trees: today he goes alone. 
Four verses, almost the same, are here condensed into one. The tree is 
kaá¹ikÄra
 (Pterospermum Acerifolium).
 
{6.500}


112. Bright yellow robes, GandhÄra make, once round about him shone,

Or glowing scarlet, as he went: today he goes alone.


113. With chariot, litter, elephant he went in former days:

Today the king Vessantara afoot must tramp the ways.


114. He once by sandal-scent perfumed, awaked by dance and song,

How wear rough skins, how axe and pot and pingo bear along?


115. Why will they not bring yellow robes, why not the garb of skin,

And dress of bark, the mighty woods that he may enter in?


116. How can a banished king put on the robe of bark to wear,

To dress in bark and grass how will the princess MaddÄ« bear?


117. MaddÄ«, who once Benares cloth and linen used to wear,

And fine kodumbara, how bark and grasses will she bear?


118. She who in litter or in car was carried to and fro,

The lovely princess, now today on foot how can she go?


119. With tender hands and tender feet in happiness she stood:

How can the lovely princess go trembling into the wood?


120. With tender hands and tender feet she lived in happy state:

The finest slippers she could wear would hurt her feet of late;

Today how can the lovely one afoot now go her gait?


121. Once she would go with garlands amidst a thousand maids:

How can the beauteous one alone now walk the forest glades?


122. Once if she heard the jackal howl she would be all dismayed:

How can the timid beauteous one now walk the forest glade?
 [6.260]


123. She who of Sakkaâs royal race would ever shrink afraid,

Trembling like one possessed, to hear the hoot some owl had made,

How can the timid beauteous one now walk the forest glade?


124. Like as a bird beholds the nest empty, the brood all slain,

So when I see the empty place long shall I burn in pain.
 {6.501}


125. Like to a bird that sees the nest empty, the brood all slain,

Thin, yellow I shall grow to see my dear son neâer again.


126. Like to a bird that sees the nest empty, the brood all slain,

Iâll run distracted, if I see my dear son neâer again.


127. As when an eagle sees its nest empty, its young brood slain,

So when I see the empty place long shall I live in pain.


128. As when an eagle sees its nest empty, its young brood slain,

Thin, yellow I shall grow to see my dear son neâer again.


129. As when an eagle sees its nest empty, its young brood slain,

Iâll run distracted, if I see my dear son neâer again.


130. Like ruddy geese beside a pond from which the waterâs gone,

Long shall I live in pain, to see no more my dearest son.


131. Like ruddy geese beside a pond from which the waterâs gone,

Thin, yellow I shall grow to see no more my dearest son.


132. Like ruddy geese beside a pond from which the waterâs gone,

Iâll fly distracted, if I see no more my dearest son.


133. And if you banish from the realm my unoffending son,

In spite of this my sore complaint, I think my life is done.â
 {6.502}

134. âHearing the queen bewailing sore, straight all together went

The palace dames, their arms outstretched, to join in her lament.


135. And in the palace of the prince, prone lying all around

Women and children lay like trees blown down upon the ground.


136. And when the night was at an end, and the sun rose next day,

Then king Vessantara began his gifts to give away.


137. âFood to the hungry give, strong drink to those who drink require, 
The commentator says: âHe knew that the gift of spirits brings no fruit with it, but gave it nevertheless, that tipplers might have the ânoble giftâ and might not be able to say that they could not get what they wanted.â This shows a tolerance not always seen in the pious.

Give clothes to those who wish for clothes, each after his desire.


138. Let not one suitor hither come go disappointed back,

Show all respect, and food or drink to taste let no man lack.â


139. And so they gathered thick and fast with joy and merry play,

As Siviâs great and fostering king prepared to go away.


140. They did cut down a mighty tree that full of fruit did stand,

When the innocent Vessantara they banished from the land.


141. They did cut down a wishing tree, with every boon at hand,

When the innocent Vessantara they banished from the land.


142. They did cut down a wishing tree, with choicest boons at hand,

When the innocent Vessantara they banished from the land.


143. Both old and young, and all between, did weep and wail that day,

Stretching their arms out, when the king prepared to go away,

Who fostered Siviâs realm.
 [6.261]


144. Wise women, 
atiyakkhÄ:
 â
bhÅ«tavijjÄ ikkhaá¹ikÄ
,â âwomen possessed, who have seen Yakkhas.â
 eunuchs, the kingâs wives, did weep and wail that day,

Stretching their arms out, when the king prepared to go away,

Who fostered Siviâs realm.


145. And all the women in the town did weep and wail that day,

When Siviâs great and fostering king prepared to go away.


146. The brahmins and ascetics too, and all who begged for need,

Stretching their arms out, cried aloud, âIt is a wicked deed!â


147. To all the city while the king his bounty did present,

And by the peopleâs sentence, fared forth into banishment.
 {6.503}


148. Seven hundred elephants he gave, with splendour all bedight, 
Compare above, p. 47
22
 (translation, p. 30), V. 258
 28
 (translation, p. 132), and the following lines.

With girths of gold, caparisoned with trappings golden bright,


149. Each ridden by his own mahout, with spikÃ¨d hook in hand:

Lo now the king Vessantara goes banished from the land!


150. Seven hundred horses too he gave, bedecked in bright array,

Horses of Sindh, and thoroughbreds, all fleet of foot are they,


151. Each ridden by a henchman bold, with sword and bow in hand:

Lo, now the king Vessantara goes banished from the land!


152. Seven hundred chariots all yoked, with banners flying free,

With tiger skin and panther hide, a gorgeous sight to see,


153. Each driven by mailÃ¨d charioteers, all armed with bow in hand:

Lo, now the king Vessantara goes banished from the land!


154. Seven hundred women too he gave, each standing in a car,

With golden chains and ornaments bedecked these women are,


155. With lovely dress and ornaments, with slender waist and small,

Curved brows, a merry smile and bright, and shapely hips withal:

Lo, now the king Vessantara goes banished from the land!


156. Seven hundred kine he also gave, with silver milkpails all:

Lo, now the king Vessantara goes banished from the land!


157. Seven hundred female slaves he gave, as many men at call:

Lo, now the king Vessantara goes banished from the land!


158-159. Cars, horses, women, elephants he gave, yet after all,

Lo, now the king Vessantara goes banished from the land!


160. That was a thing most terrible, that made the hair to stand,

When now the king Vessantara goes banished from the land!â 
The commentator, in his comment paraphrasing the above, adds another verse (p. 504): âThen sounded forth a mighty sound, a terrible great roar; For giving gifts they banish you â now have you given more!â
 {6.505}

161. âGive greeting to king SaÃ±jaya the righteous: bid him know

That since he now does banish me, to Vaá¹ka hill I go.


162. Whatever beings, mighty king, the future time shall know,

With their desires unsatisfied to Yamaâs house shall go.


163. For wrong 
abhisasiá¹: pÄ«á¸·esiá¹
, Commentator.
 I did my people, giving bounty from my hand,

By all the peopleâs sentence I go banished from the land.


164. That wrong now I expiate in the panther-haunted wood:

If you will wallow in the slough, 
paá¹kamhi: kÄmapaá¹kamhi
, Commentator.
 yet I will still do good.â

165. âMother, I take my leave of you, a banished man I stand.

For wrong I did my people, giving bounty from my hand,

By all the peopleâs sentence I go banished from the land. 
{6.506}


166. That wrong now I expiate in the panther-haunted wood:

If you will wallow in the slough, yet I will still do good.â

167. âI give you leave to go, my son, and take my blessing too:

Leave MaddÄ« and the boys behind, for she will never do;

Fair rounded limbs and slender waist, why need she go with you?â

168. âEven a slave against her will I would not take away:

But if she wishes, let her come; if not, then let her stay.â

169. âAnd then unto his daughter-in-law the king began to say:

âLet not your sandal-scented limbs bear dust and dirt, I pray,


170. Wear not bark-fibre wraps instead of fine Benares stuff;

Blessed princess, go not! Forest life indeed is hard enough.â


171. Then princess MaddÄ«, bright and fair, her father-in-law addressed:

âTo be without Vessantara I care not to be blessed.â


172. Then Siviâs mighty fostering king thus spake to her again:

âCome, MaddÄ«, listen while the woes of forests I explain.


173. The swarms of insects and of gnats, of beetles and of bees

Would sting you in that forest life, unto your great dis-ease.
 {6.507}


174. For dwellers on the river banks hear other plagues that wait:

The boa-constrictor (poisonless âtis true, but strong and great),


175. If any man or any beast come near, will take firm hold,

And drag them to his lurking-place enwrapped in many a fold.
 [6.263]


176. Then there are other dangerous beasts with black and matted hair;

They can climb trees to catch a man: this beast is called a bear.


177. Along the stream SotumbarÄ there dwells the buffalo;

Which with his great sharp-pointed horns can give a mighty blow.


178. Seeing these herds of mighty kine wander the forest through,

Like some poor cow that seeks her calf say what will MaddÄ« do?


179. When crowds of monkeys in the trees gather, they will affright

You, MaddÄ«, in your ignorance with their uncomely sight.


180. In the past the jackalâs howl would bring great fear to you:

Now dwelling on the Vaá¹ka hill, MaddÄ«, what will you do?


181. Why would you go to such a place? Even at high midday,

When all the birds are stilled to rest, the forest roars away.â


182. Then beauteous MaddÄ« to the king spake up and answered so:

âAs for these things so terrible, which you have tried to show,

I willingly accept them all; I am resolved to go.
 {6.508}


183. Through all the hill and forest grass, through clumps of bulrush reed,

With my own breast Iâll push my way, nor will complain indeed.


184. She that would keep a husband well must all her duties do;

Ready to roll up balls of dung, 
gohanubbeá¹­hanena: gohanaá¹
 is cowdung (see V. 246). I take this to refer to the patties of cowdung used as fuel.
 ready for fasting too,


185. She carefully must tend the fire, must mop up water still,

But terrible is widowhood! Great monarch, go I will.


186. The meanest harries her about; she eats of leavings still:

For terrible is widowhood! Great monarch, go I will.


187. Knocked down and smothered in the dust, haled roughly by the hair â

A man may do them any hurt, all simply stand and stare.

O terrible is widowhood! Great monarch, go I will.


188. Men pull about the widowâs sons with cruel blows and foul,

Though fair and proud of winning charm, as crows would peck an owl.

O terrible is widowhood! Great monarch, go I will.


189. Even in a prosperous household, bright with silver without end,

Unkindly speeches never cease from brother or from friend.

O terrible is widowhood! Great monarch, go I will.


190. Naked are rivers waterless, a kingdom without king,

A widow may have brothers ten, yet is a naked thing.

O terrible is widowhood! Great monarch, go I will.


191. A banner is the chariotâs mark, a fire by smoke is known,

Kingdoms by kings, a wedded wife by husband of her own.

O terrible is widowhood! Great monarch, go I will.


192. The wife who shares her husbandâs lot, be it rich or be it poor,

Her fame the very gods do praise, in trouble she is sure.


193-194. My husband I will follow still, the yellow robe to wear,

To be the queen 
icche
 occurs for the first time here; it comes from 
irÅ
, âto ruleâ (Commentator. â
issarÄ hoti
â).
 of all the earth without, I would not care.

O terrible is widowhood! Great monarch, go I will.


195. Those women have no heart at all, theyâre hard and cannot feel,

Who when their husbands are in woe, desire to be in weal.


196. When the great lord of Sivi land goes forth to banishment,

I will go with him; for he gives all joy and all content.â
 [6.264] {6.509}


197. Then up and spake the mighty king to MaddÄ« bright and fair:

âBut leave your two children behind: for what can they do there,

Auspicious lady? We will keep and give them every care.â


198. Then MaddÄ« answered to the king, that princess bright and fair:

âMy JÄli and Kaá¹hÄjinÄ are dearest to my heart:

Theyâll in the forest dwell with me, and they will ease my smart.â
 {6.510}


199. Thus answer made the monarch great, thus Siviâs foster-king:

âFine rice has been their food and well-cooked viands hitherto:

If they must feed on wild tree fruit, what will the children do?


200. From silver dishes well adorned or golden hitherto,

They ate: but with bare leaves instead what will the children do?


201. Benares cloth has been their dress, or linen hitherto:

If they must dress in grass or bark, what will the children do?


202. In carriages or palanquins theyâve ridden hitherto

When they must run about on foot, what will the children do?


203. In gabled chambers they would sleep safe-bolted hitherto:

Beneath the roots of trees to lie, what will the children do?


204. On cushions, rugs or broidered beds they rested hitherto:

Reclining on a bed of grass, what will the children do?


205. They have been sprinkled with sweet scents and perfumes hitherto:

When covered all with dust and dirt, what will the children do?


206. When peacockâs feathers, yakâs tail fans have fanned them hitherto,

Bitten by insects and by flies, what will the children do?â â

207. âThen MaddÄ« answered to the king, that lady bright and fair:

Do not lament for us, my lord, nor be perplexÃ¨d so:

The children both will go with us wherever we shall go.


208. With these words MaddÄ« went away, that lady bright and fair:

Along the highroad, and the two children her path did share.
 {6.511}


209. Then king Vessantara himself, his vow performed as bound,

Does reverence to his parents both, and passes rightwise round.


210. Then, mounting in the chariot swift, drawn by its team of four,

With wife and children off he sped where Vaá¹kaâs peak did soar.


211. Then drove the king Vessantara where most the crowd did swell,

And cried: âWe go! A blessing on my kinsfolk â fare you well!â â

212. âWhen from the city he came forth, he turned again to look:

And, therefore, like a banyan tree great Mount Sineru shook.â

213. âSee, MaddÄ«, see the lovely place from which we now have come â

The king of Siviâs dwelling-house and our ancestral home!â 
{6.512}

214. âThen did four brahmins catch him up, and for the horses plead:

He gave the horses on the spot â each beggar had one steed.â

215. âSee, MaddÄ«, what a wondrous thing â a marvel, MaddÄ«, see!

These clever horses, in the shape of red deer, drawing me!â

216. âA fifth came thereupon, and asked the chariot of the king:

He gave this also, and his heart to keep it did not cling.


217. Then made the king Vessantara his people to dismount,

And gave the chariot to the man who came on that account.â
 {6.513}

218. âMaddÄ«, you take Kaá¹hÄjinÄ, for she is light and young,

But JÄli is a heavy boy, so Iâll bring him along.â 
[6.266]

219. âHe carrying his boy, and she her daughter, on they went,

Talking together on the road in joy and all content.â

220. âWhenever they met travellers coming along the way,

They asked directions for their road, and where Mount Vaá¹ka lay.


221. The travellers all wept full sore to see them on the way,

And told them of their heavy task: âThe road is long, they say.â â

222. âWheneâer the children did behold trees growing on the steep

Laden with fruit, the children for the fruit began to weep.


223. But when they saw the children weep, the tall trees sorrowful

Bowed down their branches to their hands, that they the fruit might pull.


224. Then MaddÄ« cried aloud in joy, that lady fair and bright,

To see the marvel, fit to make oneâs hair to stand upright.


225. Oneâs hair might stand upright to see the marvel here is shown:

By power of king Vessantara the trees themselves bend down!â
 {6.514}

226. âThe Yakkhas made the journey short, pitying the childrenâs plight,

And so to Ceta kingdom they arrived before the night.â

227. âAway to Ceta they proceed, a journey great and long,

A kingdom rich in food and drink, and prosperous, and strong.â

228. âSeeing the auspicious lady there the women round her throng.

The tender lady! Now afoot she needs must walk along.


229. In palanquin or chariot once the noble lady rode:

Now MaddÄ« needs must go afoot; the woods are her abode.â
 {6.515}

230. âSeeing him, the Ceta princes came, with wailing and lament.

âGreet you, my lord: we trust that you are prosperous and well, 
Compare 584

, and 
MahÄbhÄrata
 (Calcutta) XII. 13, 727.

That of your father and his realm you have good news to tell.


231. Where is your army, mighty king? And where your royal car?

With not a chariot, not a horse, you now have journeyed far:

Were you defeated by your foes that here alone you are?â â

232. âI thank you, sirs; be sure that I am prosperous and well;

And of my father and his realm I have good news to tell.


233. I gave the saviour elephant, pole-tuskÃ¨d, goodly white, 
Above, p. 254 (text, p. 490).

Which ever knew the vantage-ground to choose in every fight;


234. His jewels, and his yakâs tail fan; which trampled down the foes,

Long-tuskÃ¨d, furious, white as Mount KelÄsa with his snows;


235. With trappings and white parasol, fit riding for a king,

With leech and driver: yes, I gave away this precious thing.


236. Therefore the people were in wrath, my father took it ill:

Therefore he banished me, and I now go to Vaá¹ka hill.

I pray you, tell me of a place to be my dwelling still.â

237. âNow welcome, welcome, mighty king, and with no doubtful voice:

Be lord of all that here is found, and use it at your choice.


238. Take herbs, roots, honey, meat, and rice, the whitest and the best:

Enjoy it at your will, O king, and you shall be our guest.â

239. âYour proffered gifts I here accept, with thanks for your goodwill.

But now the king has banished me; I go to Vaá¹ka hill.

I pray you, tell me of a place to be my dwelling still.â

240. âStay here in Ceta, mighty king, until a message go

To tell the king of Sivi land what we have come to know.


241. Then they behind him in a throng escorting him did go,

All full of joy and confidence: this I would have you know.â
 [6.268]

242. âI would not have you send and tell the king that I am here:

He is not king in this affair: he has no power, I fear.


243. The palace folk and townsfolk all in wrath came gathering,

All eager that because of me they might destroy the king.â
 {6.517}

244. âIf in that kingdom came to pass so terrible a thing,

Surrounded by the Ceta folk stay here, and be our king.


245. The realm is prosperous and rich, the people strong and great:

Be minded, sir, to stay with us and govern this our state.â

246. âHear me, O sons of Ceta land! I have no mind to stay,

As I go forth a banished man, nor here hold royal sway.


247. The Sivi people one and all would be ill pleased to know

That you had sprinkled me for king, as banished forth I go.


248. If you should do it, that would be a most unpleasant thing,

To quarrel with the Sivi folk: I like not quarrelling.


249-250. Your proffered gifts I here accept, with thanks for your goodwill.

But now the king has banished me: I go to Vaá¹ka hill.

I pray you, tell me of a place to be my dwelling still.â

251. âYes, we will tell you how a king who leaves the world may be

Good, peaceful by his sacred fire, and all tranquillity.


252. That rocky mountain, mighty king, is GandhamÄdana,

Where with your children and your wife together you may stay.


253. The Ceta folk, with faces all bewept and streaming eyes,

Advise you to go northward straight where high its peaks uprise.


254. There you shall see Mount Vipula (and blessing with you go),

Pleasant with many a growing tree that casts cool shade below.


255. When you shall reach it, you shall see (a blessing with you still)

KetumatÄ«, a river deep and springing from the hill.


256. Full of all fish, a safe resort, its deep flood flows away:

There you shall drink, and there shall bathe, and with your children play.


257. And there, upon a pleasant hill, cool-shaded, you will see,

Laden with fruit as honey sweet, a noble banyan tree.


258. Then you will see Mount NÄlika, and that is haunted ground:

For there the birds in concert sing and Kimpurisas abound.
 [6.269]


259. There further still towards the north is Mucalinda lake,

On which the lilies blue and white a covering do make.


260. Then a thick forest, like a cloud, with grassy sward to tread,

Trees full of flowers and of fruit, all shady overhead,

Enter: a lion seeking prey wherewith he may be fed.


261. There when the forest is in flower, a shower of song is heard,

The twitter here and twitter there of many a bright-winged bird.


262. And if those mountain cataracts you follow to their spring,

Youâll find a lily-covered lake with blossoms 
karaÃ±ja
 (Pongamia Glabra), 
kakudha
 (Terminalia Arjuna).
 flowering,


263. Full of all fish, a safe resort, deep water without end,

Foursquare and peaceful, scented sweet, no odour to offend:


264. There build yourself a leafy cell, a little to the north,

And from the cell which you shall make in search of food go forth.â
 {6.519}

265. âOnce in KÄliá¹ga, JÅ«jaka a brahmin spent his life,

Who had AmittatÄpanÄ, quite a young girl, to wife.


266. The women who with waterpots down to the river came,

Cried shame upon her, crowding up, and roundly cursed her name.


267. A foe indeed your mother was, a foe your father too, 
A pun on 
amitto,
 âfoeâ.

To let an old decrepit man wed a young wife like you.


268-271. Your people brewed a secret plot, a bad, mean, cruel plan,

To let a fine young girl be wed to an old decrepit man.
 {6.522}


272. A hateful thing your life must be, as youthful as you are,

With an old husband to be wed; nay, death were better far.


273. It surely seems, my pretty one, your parents were unkind

If for a fine young girl they could no other husband find.


274. Your fire-oblation, and your ninth 
A sacrifice nine days after birth?
 were offered all for naught

If by an old decrepit man so young a wife was caught.


275. Some brahmin or ascetic once no doubt you have reviled,

Some virtuous or learned man, some ascetic undefiled,

If by an old decrepit man so young a wife was caught.


276. Painful a spear-thrust, full of pain the serpentâs fiery bite:

But a decrepit husband is more painful to the sight.


277. With an old husband there can be no joy and no delight,

No pleasant talk: his very laugh is ugly to the sight.


278. When men and maidens, youth with youth, hold intercourse apart

They make an end of all the woes that harbour in the heart.


279. You are a girl whom men desire, youâre young and you are fair:

How can an old man give you joy? Go home and tarry there!â

280. âI cannot fetch the water home, the women mock me so:

Because my husband is so old they mock me when I go.â

281. âYou need not fetch the water home, you need not serve me so:

Do not be angry, lady mine: for I myself will go.â

282. âYou fetch the water? No, indeed! Thatâs not our usual way.

I tell you plainly, if you do, with you I will not stay.


283. Unless you buy a slave or maid this kind of work to do,

I tell you plainly I will go and will not live with you.â

284. âHow can I buy a slave? I have no craft, no corn, no pelf:

Come, be not angry, lady mine: Iâll do your work myself.â 
[6.272]

285. âCome now, and let me tell to you what I have heard them say.

Out yonder in the Vaá¹ka hill lives king Vessantara:


286. Go, husband, to Vessantara and ask him for a slave;

The prince will certainly consent to give you what you crave.â

287. âI am an old decrepit man; the road is rough and long;

But do not worry, do not weep â and I am far from strong:

But be not angry, lady mine: Iâll do the work myself.â 
{6.524}

288. âYouâre like a soldier who gives in before the fight: but why?

And do you own that you are beat before you go 
Reading 
agantva
.
 and try?


289. Unless you buy a slave or maid this kind of work to do,

I tell you plainly, I will go, I will not live with you.

That will be a most unpleasant thing, a painful thing for you.


290. When happy in anotherâs arms you shall behold me soon,

Dressed gaily at the seasonâs change, or changes of the moon.


291. And as in your declining years my absence you deplore,

Your wrinkles and your hoary hairs will double more and more.â

292. âAnd now the brahmin full of fears to his wifeâs will gives way;

So then tormented by his love, you might have heard him say:


293. âGet me provision for the road: make me some honey-cake,

Prepare some bannocks too, and set the barley-bread to bake.


294. And then an equal 
âEqual in caste, quality, and position,â Commentator.
 pair of slaves with me Iâll bring away,

Who without wearying shall wait upon you night and day.â â

295. âThis done, the brahmin dons his shoes; then rising presently,

And walking round her towards the right he bids his wife good-bye.


296. So went he, dressed in holiness, tears standing in his eyes:

To the rich Sivi capital to find a slave he hies.â

297. âWhen further he had come, he asked the people gathered round:

âSay, where is king Vessantara? Where can the prince be found?â

To him replied the multitude who were assembled round:


298. âBy such as you heâs ruined; for by giving, giving still,

Heâs banished out of all the realm and dwells in Vaá¹ka hill.


299. By such as you heâs ruined; for by giving, giving still,

He took his wife and children and now dwells in Vaá¹ka hill.â â

300. âSo he, upbraided by his wife, in greedy passionâs sway,

Paid for his error in the wood where beasts and panthers prey.


301. Taking his staff and begging-bowl and sacrificial spoon,

He sought the forest where abode the giver of every boon.


302. Once in the forest, came the wolves thronging around his way:

He leapt aside, and went confused far from the path astray. 
The Commentator says: âWhen he entered the wood, not knowing the road to Vaá¹ka hill he became perplexed and went astray: as he sat there, the dogs of a countryman of Ceta surrounded him to keep watch; then he climbed up a tree and cried with a loud voiceâ 
(kandi)
. I take it rather from 
skand
, as in IV. 471
01
, i.e. he leapt aside, went astray. The commentator anticipates what is soon to come.


303. This brahmin of unbridled greed, finding himself astray,

The way to Vaá¹ka now quite lost, began these lines to say:
 {6.526}


304. âWhoâll tell me of Vessantara, the prince all conquering,

Giver of peace in time of fear, the great and mighty king?


305. Refuge of suitors, as the earth to all that living be,

Whoâll tell me of Vessantara, the great and mighty king?


306. All who seek favours go to him as rivers to the sea:

Whoâll tell me of Vessantara, the great and mighty king?


307. Like to a safe and pleasant lake, with water fresh and cool,

With lilies spread, whose filaments cover the quiet pool:

Whoâll tell me of Vessantara, the great and mighty king?


308. Like a great fig tree on the road, which growing there has made

A rest for weary wayfarers who hasten to its shade:

Whoâll tell me of Vessantara, the great and mighty king?


309-310. Like Banyan, SÄl, or Mango tree, which on the road has made

A rest for weary wayfarers that hasten to its shade:

Whoâll tell me of Vessantara, the great and mighty king?


311-312. Who will give ear to my complaint, the forest all around?

Glad I should be, could anyone tell where he may be found!


313-314. Who will give ear to my complaint, the forest all around?

Great blessing it would be, if one could tell where he may be found.â â
 {6.527}

315. âThe hunter ranging in the wood heard this lament, and said:

By such as you heâs ruined; for by giving, giving still,

Heâs banished out of all the realm and dwells in Vaá¹ka hill.


316. By such as you heâs ruined; for by giving, giving still,

He took his wife and children and now dwells in Vaá¹ka hill.


317. A good-for-nothing fool you are, if leaving home you wish

To seek the prince in forests, like a crane that seeks a fish.


318. Therefore, my worthy man, I will not spare your life; and so

My arrow now shall drink your blood when shot from out my bow.


319. Iâll split your head, tear out your heart and liver in a trice,

Like birds to spirits of the road Iâll make you sacrifice.


320. Iâll take your flesh, Iâll take your fat, Iâll take your heart and head,

And you shall be a sacrifice 
Reading 
Ähutiá¹

 as soon as you are dead.


321. Youâll be a welcome sacrifice, a goodly offering;

And then youâll not destroy the wife and children of the king.â
 {6.528}

322. âThe ambassadorâs inviolate, and no man may him kill:

This is a very ancient rule; so listen, if you will.


323. The people have repented them, his father misses him,

His mother pines away for grief â her eyes are waxing dim.


324. I come as their ambassador, Vessantara to bring:

Hear me, and tell me if you know where I may find the king.â

325. âI love the envoy and the prince: and here I give to you

A gift of welcome â leg of deer and pot of honey too;

Our benefactor how to find Iâll tell you what to do.â

326. âSir brahmin, yonder rocky mount is GandhamÄdan hill

Where lives the king Vessantara with wife and children still.

Skinclad he lies upon the ground and tends the fire with care.
 [6.275]


328. See yonder, trees with many fruits, green on the mountain side,

While the dark mountain-peaks uplift till in the clouds they hide.


329. There shrubs, and creepers, horsear, sÄl, and many another tree

Najjuha, 
[According to PED in Sanskrit it is, 
dÄtyÅ«ha
 a kind of cock or hen.]
 cuckoo, flocks of them, from tree to tree flitting.
 {6.529}


331. Thronging among the leafy twigs they bid the stranger come,

Welcome the guest, delighting all who make the woods their home,

Where with his children now abides Vessantara the king.


332. With brahminâs dress, with hook and spoon, the asceticâs matted hair,

Skinclad he lies upon the ground, and tends the fire with care.â

333-334. âMango, Jambu plum, Jackfruit, SÄl, all kinds of Myrobalan,

Bo, Golden Tindook, many more, including the Banyan; 
Other trees mentioned are: 
kapittha
 (Feronia Elephantum), 
kapitthana = kapitana?
 (Thespesia Populneoides).


335. Plenty of figs, all growing low, all ripe, as sweet as sweet,

Dates, luscious grapes, and honeycomb, as much as you can eat.


336. The mango trees are some in flower, some with the fruit just set,

Some ripe and green as any frog, while some are unripe yet.


337. A man may stand beneath the trees and pluck them as they grow:

The choicest flavour, colour, taste, both ripe and unripe show.


338. It makes me cry aloud to see that great and wondrous sight,

Like heaven where the gods abide, the garden of delight.


339. Palmyra, date-palm, coconut grow in that forest high,

Festoons of flowers garlanded as when the banners fly,

Blossoms of every hue and tint like stars that dot the sky.
 {6.530}


340-341. Ebony, aloe, trumpet-flower, and many another tree, 
The names of the trees are given in full, and may be found in Childers. We may add the following:

Acacias, berries, nuts, and all as thick as thick can be.


342. Hard by there is a lake bespread with lilies blue and white,

As in the garden of the gods, the Garden of Delight.


343. And there the cuckoos make the hills re-echo as they sing,

Intoxicated with the flowers which in their season spring.


344. See on the lilies drop by drop the honey-nectar fall,

And feel the breezes blowing free from out the south and west,

Until the pollen of the flowers is waften over all.
 [6.276]


345. Plenty of rice and berries

And honey drips like milk or ghee from the flowers one and all.


346. A frequent breeze blows through the trees where every scent is found,

And seems to intoxicate with flowers the forest all around.


347. The bees about the scented flowers fly thronging with their hum,

There fly the many-coloured birds together, all and some,

Cooing and chirping in delight, each with his mate they come.


348. O pretty chicky, happy chap! They twitter and they tweet:

âO lovey dovey, deary dear, my pretty little sweet!â 
This couplet is made up of words which express joy and affection, and seems to contain names for the birds playfully made; 
jÄ«vaputto
 means one who has living children. Perhaps it is not too fanciful to hear an echo of their melodious chirping. The commentator says: 
tesam etÄneva nÄmÄni ahesuá¹.


349. Festoons of flowers garlanded as when the banners fly,

Blossoms of every hue and tint, sweet odours wafted by,

Where with his children now abides Vessantara the king.


350. With brahminâs dress, with hook and spoon, the asceticâs matted hair,

Skinclad he lies upon the ground and tends the fire with care.â

351. âAccept this piece of barley-bread all soaked with honey sweet,

And lumps of well-cooked honey-cake: I give it you to eat.â

352. âI thank you, but I have no need: keep your provision still;

And take of my provision; then go, brahmin, where you will. 
{6.532}


353. Straight onward to a hermitage the pathway there will lead,

Where Accata an ascetic dwells, black-toothed, with dirty head,

With brahmin dress, with hook and spoon, the asceticâs matted hair,


354. Skinclad he lies upon the ground and tends the fire with care:

Go there, ask the way of him, and he will give you speed.


355. When this he heard, the brahmin walked round Ceta towards the right,

And went in search of Accata, his heart in high delight.

356. Then BhÄradvÄja

 went along until he came anigh

Unto the asceticâs place, to whom he spake thus courteously:


357. âO holy man, I trust that you are prosperous and well,

With grain to glean and roots and fruit abundant where you dwell.


358. Have you been much by flies and gnats and creeping things annoyed,

Or from wild beasts of prey have you immunity enjoyed?â â

359. âI thank you, brahmin â yes, I am both prosperous and well,

With grain to eat and roots and fruit abundant where I dwell. 
[6.277]


360. From flies and gnats and creeping things I suffer not annoy,

And from wild beasts of prey I here immunity enjoy.


361. In all the innumerable years Iâve lived upon this ground,

No harmful sickness that I know has ever here been found.


362. Welcome, O brahmin! Bless the chance directed you this way,

Come enter with a blessing, come, and wash your feet I pray.


363. The tindook and the piyal leaves, and kÄsumÄrÄ« sweet,

And fruits like honey, brahmin, take the best I have, and eat,


364. And this cool water from a cave high hidden on a hill,

O noble brahmin, take of it, drink if it be your will.â

365. âAccepted is your offering, and your oblation, sir.

I seek the son of SaÃ±jaya, once banished far away

By Siviâs people: if you know where he abides, please say.â

366. âYou seek the king of Sivi, sir, not with a good intent:

I think your honourâs real desire upon his wife is bent:


367. Kaá¹hÄjinÄ for handmaiden, JÄli for serving-man,

Or you would fetch the mother with her children, if you can,

The prince has no enjoyments here, no wealth or food, my man.â

368. âI wish no ill to any man, no boon I come to pray:

But sweet it is to see the good, pleasant with them to stay.


369. I never saw this monarch, whom his people sent away:

I came to see him: if you know where he abides, please say.â

370. âSir brahmin, yonder rocky mount is GandhamÄdan hill

Where lives the king Vessantara with wife and children still.


371. With brahminâs dress, with hook and spoon, the asceticâs matted hair,

Skinclad he lies upon the ground and tends the fire with care.


372. See yonder, trees with many fruits, green on the mountain side,

While the dark mountain-peaks uplift till in the clouds they hide.

Skinclad he lies upon the ground, and tends the fire with care. 
{6.534}


376. The foliage of the pepper tree in that fair spot is seen,

No dust is ever blown aloft, the grass is ever green.


377. The grasses like a peacockâs neck, soft-cotton to the touch,

Grow never more than inches four, but always just so much.

Kapittha, Mango, Jambu plum, and ripe figs dangling low,

All trees whose fruit is good to eat in that fine forest grow.


378. There sweet and clean and fragrant streams as blue as beryl flow,

Through which disporting up and down the shoals of fishes go.


379. A lake lies in a lovely spot, with lilies blue and white,

Hard by, like that which in heaven is the Garden of Delight.


380. Three kinds of lilies in that lake present them to the sight,

With varied colours: some are blue, some blood-red, others white.â

381. âAs soft as linen are the flowers, those lilies blue and white,

And other herbs grow there: the lake is Mucalinda hight.


382. And there in number infinite the full-blown flowers you see,

In summer and in winter both as high as to the knee.
 [6.278]


383. Always the many-coloured flowers blow fragrant on the breeze,

And you may hear drawn by the scent the buzzing of the bees. 
{6.535}


384. All round about the waterâs edge are standing in a row

The ebony, the trumpet-flower, and tall kadamba trees.


385-390. Six-Petals and many another tree 
Again I omit many names in this description, for which I know no English equivalents.
 with flowers all blow,

And leafy bowers all standing round about the lake one sees.

There trees of every shape and size, there flowers of every hue,

All shrubs and bushes, high and low are spread before the view:


391. The breezes sweetly waft the scent from flowers white, blue, and red,

That grow about the hermitage wherein the fire is fed.
 {6.536}


392. Close round about the waterâs edge grow many plants and trees,

Which tremble as they echo to the murmurs of the bees.


393-397. The scent of all the lovely blooms that grow about that shore

Will last you if you keep them for a week, or two, or more.


398. Three kinds of gourds, all distinct, grow in this lake, and some

Have fruit as big as waterpots, others big as a drum.


399-401. Mustard, green garlic, lilies blue to pick, and flowers full-blown,

Jasmine, sweet sandal, creepers huge about the trees are grown.
 {6.537}


402. Sweet jasmine, cotton, indigo, and plants of many a name,

Cress, trumpet-flower, grow all around like tongues of golden flame.


403-404. Yea, every kind of flower that grows in water or on land,

In and about this lovely lake lo and behold they stand.


405-406. There crocodiles and water-beasts abide of every sort,

Red deer and other animals for water do resort.


407-408. Turmeric, camphor, panick-seed, the liquorice-plant, and all

Most fragrant seeds and grasses grow with stalks exceeding tall.


409-410. There lions, tigers, elephants are seeking for a mate,

Deer red and dappled, jackals, dogs, and fawns so swift of gait,
 {6.538}


411. Yaks, antelopes, and flying fox, and monkeys great and small,

Bears, bulls, and other mighty beasts come flocking one and all:


412-413. Rhinoceros, mongoose, squirrel, boar, dog, jackal, buffalo,

Loris, hare, speckled panther, wolf and lizard, there they go:


414-416. Spiders and snakes and hairy things, and every kind of bird,

Which as they chirp and twitter round all make their voices heard:


417. Hawk, woodcock, heron, piper, owl, the cuckoo with his flute,

Partridge, geese, ospreys, pheasants, cranes, and redbacks, follow suit.
 {6.539}


418. There sweetly singing to their mates the gorgeous-coloured things,

White-tufted, blue-necked, peacock-hued flutter their pretty wings.


419-427. Why should I try their thousand names in detail to rehearse?

Imagine every kind of bird, and add them to my verse.


428. There a melodious company their thousand songs they make

And fill the air with pleasant noise round Mucalinda lake.


429. The wood is full of elephants, of antelopes and deer,

Where hanging down from all the trees great creepers do appear.


430. There mustard grows, and sugar-cane, and many kinds of rice,

And beans and other plants and herbs, all comers to suffice.


431. Yonder the footpath leads you straight unto his settling-ground

Where never hunger, never thirst, and no distaste is found,

Where with his children now abides Vessantara the king:
 [6.279]


432. With brahminâs dress, with hook and spoon, the asceticâs matted hair,

Skinclad he lies upon the ground, and tends the fire with care. 
{6.540}


433. When this he heard, the brahmin walked around him towards the right,

And went to seek Vessantara, his heart in high delight.â

434. âJÄli, arise and stand: behold a brahmin in my sight!

âTis the old time come back again, and fills me with delight!â 
[6.280]

435. âYes, yes, my father, I behold the brahmin whom you see;

He comes as though a boon to ask; our guest he needs must be.â

436. âO holy man, we trust that you are prosperous and well,

With grain to glean and roots and fruit abundant where you dwell.


437. Have you been much by flies and gnats and creeping things annoyed,

Or from wild beasts of prey have you immunity enjoyed?â

438. âI thank you, brahmin, and reply: we prosper and are well

With grain to glean and roots and fruit abundant where we dwell.


439. From flies and gnats and creeping things we suffer no annoy,

And from wild beasts of prey we here immunity enjoy.


440. Seven months we have lived happy in this forest, and have not

Once seen a brahmin, as we now see you, godlike, I wot,

With wood apple-staff and tinder-box, and with the waterpot.


441. Welcome, O brahmin! Blessed the chance directed you this way;

Come, enter with a blessing, come and wash your feet, I pray.


442. The tindook and the piyal leaves, the kÄsumÄri sweet,

And fruits like honey, brahmin, take the best I have, and eat.


443. And this cool water from a cave high hidden on a hill,

O noble brahmin, take of it, drink if it be your will.â

444. âNow tell me what may be the cause, what can the reason be,

That brings you to this mighty wood? I pray you tell to me.â

445. âAs a great water-flood is full, and fails not any day,

So you, from whom I come to beg â give me your children, pray!â

446. âI give, and shrink not: you shall be their master. But my queen

Went out this morning for our food; at evening sheâll be seen. 
[6.281]


447. Stay here this night: the morning light shall see you on your way.

Sheâll wash them and perfume them both, 
upaghÄte: sÄ«saá¹hi upasiá¹ghite
.
 and garland them with flowers.


448. Stay here this night: the morning light shall see you on your way.

Decked out with flowers they both shall be, with scents and perfumes sweet;

Take them away, and plenty take of fruits and roots to eat.â

449. âNo, mighty monarch, I would go; I do not wish to stay:

Iâll go, lest some impediment should thwart me in the way.


450. Women no generous givers are, to thwart they always try,

They know all sorts of cunning spells, and always go awry.


451. Let him who gives a gift in faith not see his motherâs face,

Or she will find impediments: O king, Iâd go apace.


452. Give me your children; let them not behold their motherâs face:

For he that gives a gift in faith, his merit grows apace.


453. Give me your children; let them not behold their motherâs face:

He who gives wealth to such as I, up to heaven goes apace.â

454. âIf you wish not to see my wife, a faithful wife is she!

Let JÄli and Kaá¹hÄjinÄ their grandfather go and see.


455. When these fair children, sweet of speech, shall come within his sight,

Heâll give you wealth in plenty, full of joy and high delight.â

456. âI fear the spoiling of my goods: O prince, I pray you hear!

The king may deal me punishment, may slay, or sell, I fear;

Without wealth and servants, my wife would mock at me, and jeer!â 
{6.545}

457. âWhen these fair children, sweet of speech, shall come within his sight,

The foster-king of Sivi folk, who always does the right,

Will give you wealth in plenty, filled with pleasure and delight.â

458. âNo, no, I will not do this thing which you would recommend:

Iâll take the children, on my wife as servants to attend.â

459. âSo JÄli and Kaá¹hÄjinÄ here and there ran,

In deep distress to hear the voice of the pursuing man.â

460. âCome hither, my beloved son, my perfect state fulfil;

Come now and consecrate my heart, and follow out my will.


461. Be you my ship to ferry me safe oâer existenceâs sea,

Beyond the worlds of birth and gods Iâll cross and Iâll be free.â

462. âCome hither, my beloved girl, my perfect state fulfil,

Come now and consecrate my heart, and follow out my will.


463. Be you my ship to ferry me safe oâer existenceâs sea,

Beyond the worlds of men and gods Iâll cross and lift

464-465. âThe foster-king of Sivi land then took his children both,

And gave this gift most precious to the brahmin, nothing loth.


466. Then was there terror and affright, and the great earth did quake,

What time the king with folded hands bestowed the children both;


467. Then was there terror and affright, and the great earth did shake,

When Siviâs king his children gave the brahmin, nothing loth.â
 {6.548}

468. âThe cruel brahmin bit a length of creeper off; which done,

He with the creeper bound their hands, and dragged the children on. 
anumajjatha
?


469. And then the brahmin, staff in hand, holding the creeper tight,

Beat them and drove them on and on before their fatherâs sight.â

470. âThe children thus at liberty then from the brahmin fly;

The boy looks on his fatherâs face, the tears are in his eye.


471. Then like a fig-leaf in the wind the little boy did quake,

Embracing threw his arms around his fatherâs feet, and spake:


472. âFather, will you dispose of us while mother is away?

O do not give us till she come! Till she return, O stay!


473. And will you then dispose of us while mother is away?

O wait until she shall return, then give us if you will!

Then let the brahmin sell us both, then let the brahmin kill!


474. His foot is huge, his nails are torn, his flesh hangs sagging down,

Long underlip and broken nose, all trembling, tawny-brown,


475. Pot-bellied, broken-backed, with eyes that chew an ugly squint, 
visamacakkhulo:
 or âof different colours,â as the Sinhalese version has it.

All spots and wrinkles, yellow-haired, with beard of bloody tint,
 [6.284]


476. Yellow, loose-jointed, cruel, huge, in skins of goats bedight,

An Amanussa, he was a most terrifying sight; 
{6.549}


477. A man, or monstrous cannibal? And can you tamely see

This Yakkha come into the wood to ask this boon of thee?


478. And is your heart a piece of stone fast bound about with steel,

To care not when this greedy man, who can no pity feel,

Binds us, and drives us off like kine? At least I would appeal


479. That sister Kaá¹ha, who as yet no trouble knows, may stay,

Now crying like a sucking fawn lost from the herd away.â â
 {6.550}

480. âI care not for the pain of death, that is the lot of all:

Neâer more to see my motherâs face, âtis this that does appal.


481. I care not for the pain of death, that is the lot of all:

Neâer more to see my fatherâs face, âtis this that does appal.


482-487. Long will my parents mourn and weep, long will they nurse their woe,

At midnight and at dawn their tears will like a river flow,

No more to see Kaá¹hÄjinÄ, whom they had cherished so.


488. Those clusters of Jambu plum trees which droop around the lake,

And all the fruitage of the woods this day we do forsake.


489. Fig tree and jack-fruit, banyan broad and every tree that grows,

Yea! All the fruitage of the woods this day we do forsake.


490. There stand they like a pleasant park, there cool the river flows,

The place where once we used to play, this day we do forsake.


491. The fruit that once we used to eat, the flowers we used to wear,

That yonder grow upon the hill, this day we do forsake.


492-493. And all the pretty little toys that once we played with there,

The horses, oxen, elephants, this day we do forsake.â
 {6.551}

494. âThe children to their father said as they were led away:

O father! Wish our mother well, and happy be your day!


495. These oxen, horses, elephants wherewith we used to play,

Give them to mother, and they will somewhat her grief allay.


496. These oxen, horses, elephants wherewith we used to play,

When she looks on them, will anon somewhat her grief allay.â

497. âThe warrior prince Vessantara thus gave his gift, and went,

And there within his leafy bower he sadly did lament.â 
[6.285]

498-499. âO when at morning or at eve for food my children cry,

Oppressed by hunger or by thirst, who will their want supply? 
{6.552}


500. How will their little trembling feet along the roadway go

Unshod? Whoâll take them by the hand and lead them gently so?


501. How could the brahmin feel no shame, while I was standing by,

To strike my harmless innocents? A shameless man say I!


502. No man with any sense of shame would treat another so,

Were it a servant of my slave, and I brought very low.


503. I cannot see him, but he scolds and beats my children dear,

While like a fish caught in a trap Iâm standing helpless here.â

504. âHe bound his sword upon his left, he armed him with his bow:

âIâll bring my children back again; to lose them is great woe.


505. But even if my children die âtis wicked to feel pain:

507. Lifeâs nothing to us: let us die; we are his chattels now,

This cruel greedy violent man, who drives us like his cow.


508. These clusters of Jambu plum trees, which droop around the lake,

And all the verdure of the woods, O Kaá¹hÄ, we forsake.


509. Fig tree and jack-fruit, banyan tree, and every tree that grows,

Yea all the many kinds of fruit, O Kaá¹hÄ, we forsake.


510. There stand they like a pleasant park, there cool the river flows;

The place where once we used to play, O Kaá¹hÄ, we forsake.


511-512. The fruit that once we used to eat, the flowers we used to wear,

That yonder grow upon the hill, O Kaá¹hÄ, we forsake.


513. And all the little pretty toys that once we played with there,

The horses, oxen, elephants, O Kaá¹hÄ, we forsake.â
 [6.286]

514. âNow JÄli and Kaá¹hÄjinÄ, thus by the brahmin led,

Somehow got free, and then away and on and on they fled.â 
{6.554}

515. âAnd so the brahmin took his cord, and so his staff he took,

And brought them back with beating, while the king was forced to look.â

516. âThen spake Kaá¹hÄjinÄ and said: âMy father, pray you see â

As though I were a home-born slave this brahmin thrashes me!


517. Brahmins are men of upright life: no brahmin he can be.

A Yakkha sure in brahmin-shape, that leads us off to eat.

And can you stay and see us led to be a Yakkhaâs meat?â â

518. âSore are these little feet of mine, hard in the way we go,

The brahmin drives us on and on, the sun is sinking low. 
{6.555}


519. On hills and forests, and on those that dwell in them, we call,

We reverently bow to greet the spirits, one and all


520-521. That haunt this lake; its plants and roots and creepers, and we pray

To wish our mother health: but us the brahmin drives away.

If she would follow after us, let her make no delay.


522. Straight leads unto the hermitage this path by which we go;

And if she will but follow this, she soon will find us so.


523. You gatherer of wild fruits and roots, you of the knotted hair,

To see the empty hermitage will cause you great despair.


524. Long stayed our mother on her quest, great store she must have found,

Who knows not that a cruel man and greedy has us bound,

A very cruel man, who now like cattle drives us round.


525. Ah, had our mother come at eve, and had they chanced to meet,

Had she given him a meal of fruit with honey mixed, to eat, 
[6.287]


526. He would not drive us cruelly, when he his meal had hent:

Cruel he drove us, and our feet loud echoed as we went!

So for their mother longing sore the children did lament.â 
{6.556}

527. âA lion, tiger, a leopard, three creatures of the brake,

Which heard this lamentation loud, thus each to other spake:


528. Let not the princess back return at eve from seeking food,

Lest the wild beasts should slay her in our kingdom of the wood.


529. If lion, leopard, tiger should the auspicious mother slay,

O where would then prince JÄli be, O where Kaá¹hÄjinÄ,

The parent and the children both do you preserve this day.â

530. âDown falls my spade, a throbbing now in my right eye I feel,

The fruitful trees unfruitful seem, all round me seems to reel!â


531. And when she turned at evening time to go, the dayâs work done,

Wild beasts beset her homeward path at setting of the sun.


532. âThe hermitage is far, I think, the sun is sinking low

And all the food they have to eat is what I bring, I know.


533. And there my prince sits all alone within the leafy hut,

The hungry children comforting: and I returning not.
 [6.288]


534-535. It is the time of evening meal, O woe is me! âTis late:

Thirsting for water or for milk my children me await;


536-538. They come to meet me, standing like calves looking for their dam;

Like wild-goose chicks above the lake â O wretched that I am!


539. This is the sole and only path, with ponds and pits around:

And I can see no other road now I am homeward bound.


540. O mighty monarchs of the woods, O royal beasts, I cry,

Be brothers now in righteousness, 
She appeals to them as a princess, Commentator.
 and let me safe go by!


541. I am a banished princeâs wife, a prince of glory fair;

As SÄ«tÄ did for RÄma, so I for my husband care.


542. When you go home at evening time, your children you can see:

So JÄli and Kaá¹hÄjinÄ be given once more to me!


543. Here are abundant roots and fruits, much food I have to chew:

The half I offer now to you: O let me safely go!
 {6.558}


544. A king my father, and a queen my mother â hear my cry!

Be brothers now in righteousness, and let me safe go by!â

545. âThe beasts that heard her thus lament with great exceeding woe,

In voice of sweet and gentle sound, went off and let her go.â

546. âThe children, dusty, close to home, are wont to meet me here

Like calves that seek the mother-cow, like birds above the mere.


547-549. Like little deer, with pricked-up ear, they meet me on the way:

With joy and happiness they skip and frolic in their play:

But JÄli and Kaá¹hÄjinÄ I cannot see today.


550. As goat and lioness may leave their young, a bird her cage,

To seek for food, so have I done their hunger to assuage:

But JÄli and Kaá¹hÄjinÄ I cannot see today.


551. Here are their traces, close by home, like snakes upon the hill,

The little heaps of earth they made all round, remaining still:

But JÄli and Kaá¹hÄjinÄ I cannot see today.


552. All covered up with dust to me my children used to run,

Sprinkled with mud, but now indeed I can see neither one.


553. Like kids to welcome back their dam they ran from home away

As from the forest I returned; I see them not today.


554-555. Here they were playing, here this yellow wood apple fruit let fall:

But JÄli and Kaá¹hÄjinÄ I cannot see today.


556-557. These breasts of mine are full of milk, my heart will break withal:

But JÄli and Kaá¹hÄjinÄ I cannot see today.


558. They used to cling about my hips, one hanging from my breast:

How they would meet me, dust-begrimed, at time of evening rest!

But JÄli and Kaá¹hÄjinÄ I cannot see today.
 [6.289]


559. In the past this hermitage became our meeting-ground:

But now I see no children here, the whole place spins around. 
{6.560}


560-561. My children must be dead! The place so silent has become â

The very ravens do not caw, the very birds are dumb.â

562-563. âWhy are you silent? How that dream comes to my thought again:

The birds and ravens make no sound, my children must be slain!


564. O sir, have they been carried off by some wild beast of prey?

Or in the deep deserted wood have they been led astray?
 {6.561}


565. O do the pretty prattlers sleep? On errands do they fare?

O have they wandered out afar in frolic or in play?


566. I cannot see their hands and feet, I cannot see their hair:

Was it a bird that swooped? Or who has carried them away?â

567. â âTis like the wound of arrow-shot, and still more bitter smart

(But JÄli and Kaá¹hÄjinÄ I cannot see today!)


568. This is a second wound that you have struck me to the heart,

That I my children cannot see, that you have nought to say.


569. And so, O royal prince! This night since you will not reply,

I think my days are done indeed, and you will see me die.â

570. âO MaddÄ«, royal princess born, whose glory is so great,

You went for food in early morn: why come you very late?â

571. âDid you not hear the lion and the tiger loudly roar

When by the lake their thirst to slake they stood upon the shore?


572. As in the woods I walked, there came the sign I knew so well:

My spade fell from my hand, and from my arm the basket fell.


573. Then hurt, alarmed, I worshipped all the quarters, one by one,

Praying that good might come of this, my hands outstretched in prayer:


574. And that no lion, no leopard, hyena, wolf or bear,

Might tear or harry or destroy my daughter or my son.


575. A lion, tiger, and leopard, three ravening beasts, laid wait

And kept me from my homeward path: so that is why Iâm late.â

576. âMy husband and my children I have tended day and night,

As pupil tends a teacher, when he tries to do whatâs right.


577. In goatskins clothed, wild roots and fruits I from the forest brought,

And every day and every night for your convenience sought.


578. I brought you yellow wood apple fruit, my little girl and boy,

And many a ripe woodland fruit, to play and make you joy.
 [6.290]


579. This lotus root and lotus stalk, of golden yellow hue,

Join with your little ones, O prince, and eat your portion too.


580. Give the white lily to your girl, to JÄli give the blue,

And see them dance in garlands decked: O call them, Sivi, do!


581. O mighty monarch! Lend an ear while with delightful sound

Kaá¹hÄjinÄ sings sweetly, and enters our settling-ground.


582. Since we were banished, joy and woe in common shared has been:

O answer! My Kaá¹hÄjinÄ and JÄli have you seen?


583. How many holy brahmins I must have offended sore,

Of holy life, and virtuous, and full of sacred lore,

That JÄli and Kaá¹hÄjinÄ I cannot see today!â
 {6.564}

584. âThese clusters of Jambu plum trees, that droop around the mere,

And all the fruitage of the woods â my children are not here!


585. Fig tree and jack-fruit, banyan broad, and every tree that grows,

Yea, all the fruitage of the woods â my children are not here!


586-587. There stand they like a pleasant park, there cool the river flows,

The place where once they used to play â but now they are not here.


588. The fruit that once they used to eat, the flowers they used to wear

That yonder grow upon the hill â the children are not there!


589. And all the little toys that once they played with, there are those,

The oxen, horses, elephants â the children are not there!


590. Here are the many hares and owls, the dark and dappled deer,

With which the children used to play, but they themselves not here!


591. The peacocks with their gorgeous wings, the herons and the geese,

With which the children used to play, but they themselves not here!â

592. âThe woodland thickets, full of flowers that every season blow,

Where once the children used to play, but they themselves not here!


593. The lovely lakes that listen, when the ruddy geese give call,

When lotus white and lotus blue and trees like coral grow, 
See iv. 359
01
 (p. 226 of the translation).

Where once the children played, but now no children are at all.â
 {6.565}

594. âThe kindling wood you have not split, the fire you have not lit,

Nor brought the water as before: why do you idly sit?


595. When I return unto my den my toil is done away,

But JÄli and Kaá¹hÄjinÄ I cannot see today!â

596-597. âO husband mine, I cannot see by whom their death has come:

The very ravens do not caw, the very birds are dumb.â

598. âWhen she had traversed in the search each forest and each hill,

Back to her husband she returned, and stood lamenting still. 
{6.566}


599-601. In hills, woods, caves I cannot see by whom their death has come:

The very ravens do not caw, the very birds are dumb.


602. Then MaddÄ«, dame of high renown, princess of royal birth,

Lamenting with her arms outstretched fell down upon the earth.â

603. âHe sprinkled her with water as she fell down faint as dead,

And when she had come back again to consciousness, he said.â 
{6.567}

604. âI did not speak at once, because I shrank to cause you pain.

A poor old brahmin came to beg, and so, of giving fain,

I gave the children: do not fear, O MaddÄ«! Breathe again.


605. O MaddÄ«, do not grieve too sore, but set your eyes on me:

Weâll get them back alive once more, and happy shall we be.


606. Good men should ever give when asked, sons, cattle, wealth, and grain.

MaddÄ«, rejoice! A greater gift than children cannot be.â
 [6.292]

607. âI do rejoice! A greater gift than children cannot be.

By giving set your mind at rest; pray do the like again:


608. For you, the mighty fostering king of all the Sivi land,

Amidst a world of selfish men gave gifts with lavish hand.â

609. âThe earth did rumble, and the sound the highest heaven fills,

The lightning flared, the thunder woke the echoes of the hills!


610. Then NÄrada and Pabbata both greatly did rejoice,

Yea, all the Three and Thirty Gods with Sakka, at that voice. 
Four lines in another metre interrupt this couplet, which mention the names of Indra, Brahma, PrajÄpati, with kings Soma, Yama, and Vessavaá¹a.


611. Thus MaddÄ«, dame of royal birth, princess of high degree,

Rejoiced with him: a greater gift than children none can be.â

612. âAnd so when night was at an end, about the peep of day,

Sakka in brahminâs form to them first early made his way. 
{6.569}


613. O holy man, I trust that you are prosperous and well,

With grain to glean, and roots and fruit abundant where you dwell. 
See above, p. 276.


614. Have you been much by flies and gnats and creeping things annoyed,

Or from wild beasts of prey have you immunity enjoyed?â

615. âThank you, brahmin â yes, I am both prosperous and well,

With grain to glean, and fruits and roots abundant where I dwell.


616. From flies and gnats and creeping things I suffer no annoy,

And from wild beasts of prey I here immunity enjoy.
 [6.293]


617. Iâve lived here seven sad months, and you the second brahmin found,

Holding a goat-staff in his hand, to reach this forest-ground.


618. Welcome, O brahmin! Blessed the chance directed you this way; 
See above, pp. 48, 277, 280.

Come enter with a blessing, come, and wash your feet, I pray.


619. The tindook and the piyal leaves, and kÄsumÄrÄ« sweet,

And fruits like honey, brahmin, take the best I have, and eat.


620. And this cool water from a cave high hidden on a hill,

O noble brahmin! Take of it, drink if it be your will.â 
See p. 280.

621. âAnd now what reason or what cause directed you this way?

Why have you sought the mighty woods? Resolve me this, I pray.â

622. âAs a great water-flood is full and fails not any day,

So you, from whom I come to beg â give me your wife, I pray.â

623. âWeary am I, nor hide I that; yet in my own despite,

I give, and shrink not â for in gifts my heart does take delight.â

624. âThen he took up a water-jar, the king of Sivi land,

And taking MaddÄ«, gave her straight into the brahminâs hand.


625. Then was there terror and affright, then the great earth did quake,

What time he rendered MaddÄ« for his visitor to take.


626. The face of MaddÄ« did not frown, 
bhakuá¹­Ä«
 âa frown.â Not in Childers.
 she did not massage or cry,

But looked on silent, thinking, âHe knows best the reason why.â


627. âBoth JÄli and Kaá¹hÄjinÄ I let another take,

And MaddÄ« my devoted wife, and all for wisdomâs sake.


628. Not hateful is my faithful wife, nor yet my children are,

But perfect knowledge, to my mind, is something dearer far.â â

629. âFrom maidenhood I was his wife, he is my master still:

Let him to whomso he desire to give, or sell, or kill.â 
[6.294] {6.571}

630. âThereat spake Sakka, seeing how her wishes did incline:

Conquered is every obstacle, both human and divine.


631. The earth did rumble, and the sound the highest heaven fills,

The lightning flares, the thunder wakes the echoes of the hills.


632. Now NÄrada and Pabbata to hear this mighty voice,

Yea, all the Three and Thirty Gods at this hard feat rejoice.


633. âTis hard to do as good men do, to give as they can give,

Bad men can hardly imitate the life that good men live.


634. And so, when good and evil go to pass away from earth,

The bad are born in hell below, in heaven the good have birth. 
See II. 86 (translation, p. 59), IV. 65 (translation, p. 42).


635. This is the Supreme Vehicle: 
No trace has hitherto been found in the South of the Three Vehicles of Northern Buddhism 
(Åiká¹£Äsamuccaya
 328
08
, cp. 
Lotus de la Bonne Loi

)
; it is therefore worth while quoting the note on the word 
brahmayÄnaá¹:
 â
seá¹­á¹­hayÄnaá¹, tividho hi sucaritadhammo evarÅ«po dÄnadhammo ariyamaggassa paccayo hotÄ«ti, brahmayÄnam ti vuccati
.â [The Best Vehicle because of the threefold good conduct (good actions, speech and thoughts), such as generosity, there is the condition for the Noble Path, therefore the Supreme Vehicle is said.]
 both wife and child were given,

Therefore let him descend 
anokkamma:
 â
apÄyabhÅ«mim anokkamitvÄ
â used absolutely. No example in Childers.
 no more, but this bear fruit in heaven.â

636. âSir, now I give you MaddÄ« back, your fair and lovely wife,

A pair well-matched, and fitted for a most harmonious life.


637. Like the inevitable bond âtwixt water and a shell,

So you with MaddÄ«; mind and heart are both according well.


638. Of equal birth and family on either parentsâ side

Here in a forest hermitage together you abide,

That you may go on doing good where in the woods you dwell.â

639. âSakka the king of Gods am I, here come your place to see:

Choose you a boon, O royal sage, eight boons I give to you.â

640. âSakka, the lord of all the earth, has given me a boon.

Pray you my father reconcile, let him recall me soon

And set me in my royal seat: this the first boon I crave.


641. May I condemn no man to death, not though he guilty be,

Condemned, may I release from death: this second boon I crave.


642. May all the people for their help look only unto me,

The young, the old, the middle-aged: this the third boon I crave.


643. May I not seek my neighbourâs wife, contented with my own,

Nor subject to a womanâs will: this the fourth boon I crave.
 [6.295]


644. I pray you, Sakka, grant long life to my beloved son,

Conquering the world in righteousness: this the fifth boon I crave.


645. Then at the end of every night, at dawning of the day,

May food celestial be revealed: this the sixth boon I crave.


646. May means of giving never fail, and may I give alway

With hearty gladness and content: this the seventh boon I crave.
 {6.573}


647. Hence freed, may I be straight advanced to heaven, then that I may

No more be born upon the earth: this the eighth boon I crave.â

648. âEre long, the father whom you love, will wish his son to see.â

649. âThe Mighty One, the King of Gods, this said, Sujampati,

After the giving of the boons straight back to heaven went he.â

650. âWhose face is this that yellow shines, dry as though fire did scorch,

Like some gold bangle â one as though all shrivelled with a torch?


651. Both like in body, like in marks â who can these children be?

Like JÄli is the boy, and like Kaá¹hÄjinÄ is she.
 [6.296]


652. Theyâre like two little lion cubs that from their cave descend,

And like each other: and they seem all golden as they stand.â

653. âGood BhÄradvÄja, tell me whence you have those children brought?â

654. âA fortnight since one gave them me, well pleased with what he wrought.â 
{6.575}

655. âBy what soft speech or word of truth did you make him believe?

From whom these children, chief of all gifts, did you receive?â

656. âIt was the king Vessantara, in forest lands who lives,

Gave them as slaves, who like the earth to all suitors freely gives.


657. âTwas king Vessantara who gave his own as slaves to me,

To whom all suitors go, as go all rivers to the sea.â

658. âWere he at home, it were ill done by any king thatâs good:

How could he give his children then, when banished in the wood?


659. O listen to me, gentles all, that here assembled stand,

How could the king his children give to serve anotherâs hand?


660. Slaves male or female he might give, a horse, a mule, a car,

Or elephants: but how give those who his own children are?â

661. âHow, grandfather, can he give, when none in his possession are,

Slaves male or female, elephants, a horse, a mule, a car?â

662. âChildren, I praise your fatherâs gift: no word of blame I say.

But then how was it with his heart when he gave you away?â

663. âAll full of trouble was his heart, and it burned hot as well,

His eyes were red like RohinÄ«, and down the teardrops fell.â

664. âFather, this brahmin see â

With creepers, like his homeborn slave, my back he loves to beat.


665. This is no brahmin, father dear! For brahmins righteous be;

A Yakkha this in brahmin shape, who drives us off to eat.

How can you see us driven off with all this cruelty?â 
[6.297]

666. âYou children of a king and queen, royal your parents are:

Once you would climb upon my hip; why do you stand afar?â

667. âWeâre children of a king and queen, royal our parents are,

But now a brahminâs slaves are we, and so we stand afar.â

668. âMy dearest children, speak not so; my heart is parched with heat,

My bodyâs like a blazing fire, uneasy is this seat.


669. My dearest children, speak not so; you make me sorrow sore.

Come, I will buy you with a price, you shall be slaves no more.
 {6.577}


670. Come tell me truly as it is, I will the brahmin pay â

What price your father set on you when he gave you away?â

671. âA thousand pieces was my price: to set my sister free,

Of elephants and all the rest 
Reading 
hatthinÄdisatena
 with B
d
. This must be the sense, but the reading is uncertain.
 a hundred each fixed he.â

672. âUp, bailiff, pay the brahmin quick, and let the price be told:

A hundred male and female slaves, and cattle from the fold,

A hundred elephants and bulls, a thousand pounds in gold.â


673. The bailiff paid the brahmin quick, at once the price was told:

A hundred male and female slaves, and cattle from the fold,

A hundred bulls and elephants, a thousand pounds in gold.â

674. âThe children bought, well washed and dressed, richly adorned, and fed, 
{6.578}

And set on their grandparentsâ hips, the king then spake and said:


675-677. âJÄli, your parents are we trust both prosperous and well, 
See III. 371
21
 (translation, p. 234).

With grain to glean and roots and fruits abundant where they dwell.


678. Have they been much by flies and gnats and creeping things annoyed,

And have they from wild beasts of prey immunity enjoyed?â â

679. âI thank you, king, and answer thus: my parents both are well,

With grain to glean and roots and fruits abundant where they dwell.


680. From flies and gnats and creeping things they suffer not annoy,

And from wild beasts of prey they there immunity enjoy.


681. Wild bulbs and radishes she digs, catmint and herbs seeks she,

With jujubes, nuts, and wood apple fruit she finds us food alway.
 [6.298]


682. And when she brings wild fruits and roots, whatever they may be,

We all together come and eat by night and eke by day.


683. Our motherâs thin and yellow grown by seeking for our food,

Exposed to heat, exposed to wind in the beast-haunted wood.


684. Like to a tender lotus flower held in the hand which fades:

Her hair is thin 
âTorn out by the twigs of the trees,â Commentator.
 with wandering amid the forest glades.


685. Beneath her armpits clotted dirt, her hair in topknot bound,

She tends the fire, and clothed in skins she sleeps upon the ground.â

686. âIt is the custom in the world that each man loves his son;

But this in one case it would seem your honour has not done.â 
{6.579}

687. âIt was ill done of me indeed to ruin the innocent,

When by the peopleâs voice I drove my son to banishment.


688. Then all the wealth which I possess, all that I have in hand,

Be his; and let Vessantara come and rule in Sivi land.â

689. âNot for my word will he return, the chief of Sivi land:

Then go thyself and fill your son with blessings from your hand.â

690. âMy horses, chariots, elephants, and soldiers go prepare,

And let the people come around, the family priests all be there.


691. The sixty thousand warrior lords armed and adorned so fair,

Dressed up in blue or brown or white, with bloodred crests, be there.


692-694. Like as the spirit-haunted hills, where trees a plenty grow,

Are bright and sweet with plants divine, so here the breezes blow.


695-696. Bring fourteen thousand elephants, with trappings all of gold,

With drivers holding lance and hook: as many horse be told.


697-698. Sindh horses, all of noble breed, and very swift to go,

Each ridden by a henchman bold, and, holding sword and bow. 
Compare V. 259
04
 (translation, p. 132).
 {6.580}


699. Let fourteen thousand chariots be yoked and well arrayed,

Their wheels well wrought of iron bands, and all with gold inlaid.


700. Let them prepare the banners there, the shields and coats of mail,

And bows withal, those men of war that strike and do not fail.â

701. âStrow lÄja flowers all about, and scented garlands strow,

Let there be pious offerings on the way that he shall go.


702. Each hamlet bring a hundred jars of wine for those who wish,

And set them down beside the road by which my son shall go.
 [6.299]


703. Let flesh and cakes be ready there, soup garnished well with fish,

And set them down beside the road by which my son shall go.


704. Wine, oil, and ghee, milk, millet, rice, and curds in many a dish,

Let them be set beside the road by which my son shall go.


705-706. Cooks and confectioners be there, and men to sing or play,

Dancers and tumblers, tomtom men, to drive dull care away.


707. The lutes give voice, the harsh-mouthed conch, and let the people thrum

On timbrels and on tabours and on every kind of drum.â
 {6.581}

708. âThen did the mighty host set forth, the army of the land,

And went towards the Vaá¹ka hill, while JÄli led the band.


709. The elephant of sixty years gave forth a trumpet sound, 
âThe people of KÄsi had returned him to SaÃ±jaya, ruin having fallen in their country; he trumpeted with joy because he expected to see his mother again,â Commentator.

Loud trumpeted the mighty beast what time his girth they bound.


710. Then rattled loud the chariot wheels, then neighed the horses loud,

As the great army marched along the dust rose in a cloud.


711. For every need provided well the host marched with a will,

And JÄli led the army on as guide to Vaá¹ka hill.


712. They entered in the forest wide, so full of birds and trees,

With every kind of flowering plant and any fruit you please.


713. There when the forest is in flower, a shower of song is heard,

The twitter here and twitter there of many a bright-winged bird.


714. A night and day they marched, and came to the end of their long road,

And entered on the district where Vessantara abode.â
 {6.582}

715. âThe noise of this approaching host Vessantara did hear;

He climbed a hill and looked upon the army, full of fear.


716. âO listen, MaddÄ«, how the woods are full of roaring sound,

The neighing of the horses hear, the banners see around.
 [6.300]


717. Can they be hunters, who with pits or hunting-nets or knives

Seek the wild creatures in the woods with shouts to take their lives?


718. So we, exiled though innocent, in this wild forest land,

Expect a cruel death, now fallen into an enemyâs hand.â â

719. âAll will be well: your enemies can do no hurt to thee,

No more than any flame of fire could overcome the sea.â

720. âThen king Vessantara hereat descended from the hill,

And sat before his leafy hut and bade his heart be still.â

721. âHe set his army in array, his car turned to the road,

And sought the forest where his son in loneliness abode.


722. Upon his elephant, his robe over one shoulder thrown,

Clasping his upraised hands, he went to give his son the throne.


723. Then he beheld the beauteous prince, fearless, composed in will,

Seated before his hut of leaves and meditating still.
 {6.584}


724. Vessantara and MaddÄ« then their father went to greet,

As they beheld him drawing nigh, eager his son to see.


725. Then MaddÄ« made obeisance, laid her head before his feet,

Then he embraced them; with his hand he stroked them pleasantly.â

726. âI hope and trust, my son, that you are prosperous and well,

With grain to glean and fruits and roots abundant where you dwell.


727. Have you been much by flies and gnats and creeping things annoyed,

And have you from wild beasts of prey immunity enjoyed?â

728. âMy lord, the life we had to live a wretched life has been;

We had to live as best we could, to eat what we could glean.


729. Adversity breaks in a man, just as a charioteer

Breaks in a horse: adversity, O king, has tamed us here.


730. But âtis our parentsâ absence which has made our bodies thin,

Banished, O king, and with the woods and forests to live in.â

731. âBut JÄli and Kaá¹hÄjinÄ, your hapless heirs, whom now,

A brahmin cruel, merciless, drives on like any cow, 
[6.301] {6.585}


732. If you know anything of these the royal children, tell,

As a physician tries to make a man with snake-bite well.â

733. âBoth JÄli and Kaá¹hÄjinÄ, your children, now are bought:

I paid the brahmin: therefore be consoled, my son, fear nought.â

734. âI hope, dear father, you are well, and trouble comes no more,

And that my mother does not weep until her eyes are sore.â

735. âThank you, my son, I am quite well, and trouble comes no more,

So too your mother does not weep until her eyes are sore.â

736. âI hope the kingdom all is well, the countryside at peace,

The animals all strong to work, the rain clouds do not cease.â

737. âO yes, the kingdom all is well, the countryside at peace,

The animals all strong to work, the rain clouds do not cease.â

738. âNow while they talked together thus, the mother there was seen

Approaching to the door afoot, barefooted though a queen.


739. Vessantara and MaddÄ« then their mother went to greet,

And MaddÄ« ran and laid her head before her motherâs feet.


740. The children safe and sound afar then MaddÄ« did espy,

Like little calves that see their dam loud greetings they did cry.


741. And MaddÄ« saw them safe and sound: like one possessed she sped,

Trembling, and felt all full of milk the breasts at which they fed.â

742. âWhen these of kindred blood were met, a mighty sound outspake,

That all the hills reechoed round, and the great earth did quake. 
[6.302]


743. God brought a mighty cloud wherefrom he sent a shower of rain,

When as the king Vessantara his kindred met again.


744. King, queen, and son, and daughter-in-law, and grandsons, all were there,

When they were met their flesh did creep with rising of the hair.

The people clapped their hands and loud made to the king a prayer:


745. They called upon Vessantara and MaddÄ«, one and all:

âBe you our lord, be king and queen, and listen to our call!â â

746. âYou and the people, countryfolk and townsfolk, banished me,

When I upon my royal throne was ruling righteously.â

747. âIt was ill done of me indeed to ruin the innocent,

When by the peopleâs voice I drove my son to banishment.â

748. âA fatherâs or a motherâs pain, or sisterâs, to relieve,

A man should never hesitate his very life to give.â 
{6.588}

749. â âTis time to wash, O mighty king â wash off the dust and dirt!â

750. âThen did the king Vessantara wash off the dust and dirt.â

751. âWith well-washed head and goodly robes and ornaments of state,

Girt with his awful sword he rode the elephant his mate. 
paccayo:
 âborn on the same day as himself.â Commentator.


752. And then the sixty thousand chiefs, so beauteous to view,

His birthmates, came about their lord and did obeisance due.
 {6.589}


753. The women then bathed MaddÄ«, and all together pray â

Vessantara and SaÃ±jaya preserve you all alway!


754-755. Thus reestablished, and their past trouble remembering,

There in the pleasant masterâs land they made a merry cheer.


756. Thus reestablished, and the past trouble remembering,

Happy and glad the lady went with her own children dear.â

757. âI only ate one meal a day, I slept upon the ground,

That was my vow for love of you until you should be found.


758. But now my vow is brought to pass, and now again I pray,

What good so ever we have done preserve you both alway,

And may the great king SaÃ±jaya preserve you both alway.


759. What good so ever has been done by father or by me,

By that truth grow you never old, immortal do you be.â
 {6.590}

760. âGarments of cotton and of silk, linen and cloth so fine

Her mother-in-law to MaddÄ« sent which made her beauty shine.


761-764. Necklet and bracelet, frontlet-piece, foot-bangle, jewelled zone,

Her mother-in-law to MaddÄ« sent, wherewith her beauty shone.


765. And when the princess passing fair her jewellery surveyed,

She shone, as shines in Nandana the DevakaÃ±Ã±Ä arrayed.


766. With well-washed head and ornaments and goodly robes to see,

She shone, like to some AccharÄ before the Thirty-Three.


767. As when in CittalatÄ Grove 
One of Indraâs gardens.
 the wind a plantain sways,

The princess of the beauteous lips looked lovely as that tree.


768. Like as a brilliant-feathered bird that flies the airy ways,

She with her pretty pouting lips and beauty did amaze.
 {6.591}


769. They brought a fine young elephant, a mighty and a strong,

Which neither spear nor battle din could fright, whose tusks were long.


770. She mounts upon the elephant, so mighty and so strong,

Which neither spear nor battle din could fright, whose tusks were long.â

771-772. âBy glory of Vessantara, through all that mighty wood,

No beast or bird did any harm to the others, all did good.


773-776. And when he was to go away, they all with one consent,

Birds, beasts, and all the creatures of the wood, together went:

But silent were all pleasant sounds when he had left the wood.â
 {6.592}

777. âThe royal road was newly made, with flowers and bunting fair arrayed

From where he lived in forest glade down to the town Jetuttara.


778-779. His sixty thousand mates around, and boys and women places found,

Brahmins and vesiyas, homeward bound unto the town Jetuttara.


780. There many an elephant mahout, the charioteers and men afoot,

With all the royal guard to boot were going to Jetuttara.


781. Warriors that skulls 
karotiyÄ: sÄ«sakarotiko ti laddhanÄmÄ sÄ«se paá¹­imukkakaroá¹­ino yodhÄ
.
 or pelties wore, of mailed men with swords good store,

To guard the prince went on before down to the town Jetuttara.â

782. âThen the fair city entered they, with walls and arches high,

With songs and dances, food and drink in plentiful supply.


783. Delighted were the country folk and people of the town

To welcome back to Sivi land their prince of high renown.


784. All waved their kerchiefs in the air to see the giver come;

Now is a goal-delivery proclaimed by beat of drum.â
 {6.593}

785. âWhen as Vessantara came back, Siviâs protector king,

The god a shower of precious gold upon the place did bring.


786. So when Vessantara the prince his generous gifts had given;

He died at last, and fully wise, he passed away to heaven.â

When the Teacher had ended this discourse of Vessantara, with its thousand verses, he identified the JÄtaka, âAt that time, Devadatta was JÅ«jaka, the lady CiÃ±cÄ was AmitatÄpanÄ«, Channa was Cetaputta, SÄriputta was the ascetic Accuta, Anuruddha was Sakka, king Suddhodana was king SaÃ±jaya, MahÄmÄyÄ was PhusatÄ«, RÄhulaâs mother was queen MaddÄ«, RÄhula was prince JÄli, Uppalavaá¹á¹Ä was Kaá¹hÄjinÄ, the followers of Buddha were the rest of the people, and king Vessantara was I myself.â 
A number of verses follow, describing the contents of the 
JÄtaka
 book. They are the work of some copyist.
