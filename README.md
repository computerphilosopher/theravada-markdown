# theravada-rag-corpus

_A machine-ready corpus of canonical Theravāda Buddhist texts for GPT-based RAG systems_

This repository is a curated archive of early Theravāda Buddhist scriptures and key meditation manuals, intended primarily for **machine reading in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems**. It is not optimized for general human reading, but for semantic indexing, contextual lookup, and use within large language model (LLM) applications.

## 📌 Project Context

This archive is actively used in a **custom GPTs service** built on OpenAI infrastructure.  
It serves as the core knowledge base for a specialized assistant trained in the Theravāda Buddhist tradition.

If you're viewing this repository from the GPT itself, you're already interacting with its backend.
