# Foreword

I delivered a Dhamma talk on metta ̄-meditation on a meditation retreat in New Zealand in November 1992. The talk is now tran- scribed by meditators and printed in a book form after it has been edited. The book is published in commemoration of the second ceremony of Acariya Puja in honour of the most venera- ble Chanmyay Sayadaw on January 17, 18, 19, 2015.

# Namo Tassa Bagavato Arahato Sammasambuddhassa

Metta ̄ means a mental state wishing for the welfare of all living beings, hitakarapavattilakkhana metta ̄. The meaning is that metta ̄ has the characteristic of wishing the welfare of all living beings. The mental state that wishes all living beings to be happy and peaceful is metta ̄. When you develop the spirit of loving kindness or metta ̄ towards all living beings, that is called metta ̄-bha ̄vana ̄ or metta ̄-meditation.

# Metta ̄ and Tanha ̄

In the Burmese language the word metta ̄ is used in two senses. One is the sense of loving-kindness; the other is the sense of sen- sual love. When a man is in love with a lady it is said that he loves her, he has metta ̄ for her. In this case metta ̄ is not used in the sense of loving kindness wishing the welfare of that lady; it is used in the sense of sensual love or desire. The sensual love or desire is tanha ̄, not metta ̄ (loving kindness).
When we deliver a discourse on metta ̄-bh ̄avan ̄a we have to clarify it, repeatedly distinguishing between the two senses of metta ̄ and tanha ̄. Metta ̄ has the characteristic of wishing the wel- fare of beings without attachment while tanha ̄ has the charac- teristic of clinging to the object. Metta ̄ is cool while tanha ̄ is hot. Metta ̄ makes the mind pure, calm, cool and concentrated while tanha ̄ makes the mind defiled, distracted and hot.
Some people say that you should radiate your metta ̄ towards all living beings. Unless you develop metta ̄ in yourself, how can you radiate it to other living beings? If you have developed the spirit of metta ̄ abundantly in yourself, you need not intentionally radiate it to other beings. Your mind is naturally radiating metta ̄ to them all.

When you wish the welfare of other beings you have metta ̄ in yourself. When metta ̄ is well developed in yourself, your face looks calm, serene, pleasant, happy and peaceful. Sometimes your face looks smiling. Anyone who meets you and sees your face, feels happy and peaceful by the power of your metta ̄. He has the feeling of metta ̄ for you. These are some benefits of metta ̄- bha ̄vana ̄, metta ̄-meditation. More benefits of metta ̄-meditation are mentioned in Buddhist scriptures. Lord Buddha explained eleven benefits of metta ̄ in his teaching.

Eleven Benefits of Metta ̄

In the Anguttara Nikaya, the Omniscient Buddha explains eleven benefits of metta ̄ as follows:
1. The metta ̄ meditator sleeps well.
2. He wakes up happily, feeling refreshed.
3. He has good dreams.
4. He is deart to human beings.
5. He is dear to other beings such as Devas.
6. He is protected by Devas.
7. He is not harmed by weapons,poison and fire.
8. His mind is easily concentrated.
9. His facial expression is calm,clear,serene and peaceful.
10. At the time of death, he passes away peacefully without confusion.
11. When he has passed away, he is reborn among Brahmas.

# A Young monk

In the Visuddhimagga commentary we find the story of a young monk who practised metta ̄-meditation. In ancient times in Sri Lanka a young monk, named Vis ̄akh ̄a, practised both metta ̄- bha ̄vana ̄ and vipassana ̄-bha ̄vana ̄. He stayed at a place for four months, he did not stay longer at one place. In this way he moved from one place to another. At one time he stayed in Cit- talapabbata Vihara. He intensively practised metta ̄-meditation there. After he had stayed there four months, he was about to leave Cittalapabbata and go to another place. In the last night he practised metta ̄-meditation while walking. At that time he heard someone crying nearby. He looked for the person who was cry- ing. He did not see anyone. So he asked, “Who is crying?”
Then he heard, “Venerable sir, I am the deity who lives in this tree”. Then Vis ̄akh ̄a asked, “Why are you crying?” The de- ity answered, “Venerable sir, you are going to leave this place tomorrow, so I am crying”. Then Vis ̄akh ̄a said, “My leaving this place has nothing to do with your crying”. The deity said, “Ven- erable sir, before you came and stayed here, some Devas in this forest were quarrelling and fighting one another. We had to stay always unhappily. There was no unity and no peace at all. When you came and stayed here, all Devas here were no longer quar- relling nor fighting. All De
vas loved one another. We live very happily because of your metta ̄. Now you are going to leave here. Devas will quarrel and fight again. Then we will have no peace and happiness again. So, Venerable Sir, I request you not to leave from here”. Venerable Vis ̄akh ̄a, an intensive metta ̄-meditator, considering the welfare of all Devas there, decided not to leave Cittalapabbata and stayed on there. So, the Devas loved one an- other and lived in peace and happiness all the time.
This story of a young monk is described in the Visud- dhimagga to prove some benefits of metta ̄-meditation.
Metta ̄-Meditation
When you wish to practise metta ̄-meditation, you have to take any person or any beings as the object of meditation because you wish to develop metta ̄ to some persons or beings, wishing him peace and happiness. For example, you wish to practise metta ̄- meditation for your mother. You must focus your mind towards your mother and reflect on her peace and happiness, thinking about her good character, good deed and good speech and say mentally, “May my mother be well, happy and free from suffer- ing”. These metta ̄ sentences must be recited repeatedly. They arouse the feeling of your metta ̄ for your mother. However, the sentences should be two or three, not more than that. They also should not be long, but should be short. If the sentences are many or long, the mind sticks to them. Then the feeling of metta ̄ does not arise. So meditators should be careful not to use many and long sentences.

# No Need to See Image 

Some people have the idea that in metta ̄-meditation a meditator needs to see the image of the person who is the object of meditation. This is just their idea. The Visuddhimagga does not in- struct to see the image of the object. Therefore, you should not try to visualize the image of the object. It is impossible to see all images of all living beings when we develop metta ̄ to all living beings. So meditators, without trying to see the image of object, should focus their mind towards all living beings and mentally say metta ̄ sentences, “May all beings be well, happy and free from suffering”. He may use other short sentences that enable him to arouse the feeling of metta ̄. In this way he will be able to develop metta ̄.

# Automatic Appearance of the Image

But sometimes the image may appear automatically or naturally in your mind without your effort to visualize it; it’s good. Later the image may disappear; it doesn’t matter. What does matter is to feel loving-kindness in yourself, recollecting all the virtues of the object, wishing him peace and happiness.

# Two Types of Metta ̄-Meditation

Metta ̄-Meditation is of two types. One is specific metta ̄ and the other is unspecific metta ̄. If you specify a particular person or group of persons as the object of meditation, that is specific metta ̄-meditation. If you cultivate your metta ̄ towards all liv- ing beings without any specification, that is unspecific or non- specific metta ̄-meditation. Specific metta ̄ is called odhi metta ̄ and unspecific metta ̄ is called anodhi metta ̄.

## Specific Metta ̄-Meditation

When you practise specific metta ̄-meditation you should focus your mind towards a person whom you have chosen as the object of the meditation. Then you should reflect on his welfare and mentally say, “May this person be well, happy and free from suf- fering”, recollecting his good character, good deeds, good speech etc. In this way metta ̄ sentences gradually arouse the feeling of metta ̄ in yourself, which later will be well developed.

## Unspecific Metta ̄-Meditation

As to unspecific metta ̄-meditation you are not to specify any per- son or group for the object of the meditation, but you develop your metta ̄ towards all living beings, mentally saying, “May all beings be well, happy and free from suffering”. Repeatedly, you can use such sentences as these, “May all beings be happy, free from animosity, distress and affliction”.

## Points to Note about Specific Metta ̄

The Visuddhimagga mentions four kinds of person who should not be the first object of metta ̄-meditation in the initial stage of the practice:
1. An antipathetic person should not be the first object of metta ̄-meditation in the beginning of the practice; if you put the antipathetic person in the place of the beloved one, you find it difficult to feel metta ̄ and get tired.
2. A dearly beloved person should not be the first object of metta ̄-meditation in the initial stage of the practice because developing loving-kindness towards him or her, sometimes you may think about his or her misfortune or suffering. Then you will be unhappy about it and unable to feel loving-kindness for him or her.
3. A neutral person should not be the first object of metta ̄- meditation. A neutral person is the one whom you do not love nor hate. He is just your acquaintance. If you put a neutral person in the place of the beloved one, it is difficult for you to feel metta ̄ for him.
4. A hostile person also should not be the first object of metta ̄- meditation, because when you reflect on his welfare, you may have anger arising in your mind instead of metta ̄.
The above mentioned four persons should not be the first object of metta ̄-meditation in the initial stage of the practice. When you are skilful in metta ̄-meditation, you can develop metta ̄ towards them.

# A Man Fighting Against the Wall

There is one person who should not be the object of specific metta ̄-meditation. The opposite sex should not be the object
of the specific metta ̄-meditation because the meditator may feel lust instead of metta ̄. In the Visudhimagga an interesting story is mentioned. In Sri Lanka, a man very much wished to practise metta ̄-meditation. He asked a monk, who came to his house ev- eryday for alms round, how to practise metta ̄-meditation. The monk told him to cultivate metta ̄ towards his most loved one. At night, the man comfortably sat for meditation in his room and thought about object of meditation who he loved most. It came to his mind that his wife was best loved by him. So he culti- vated metta ̄ towards his wife who slept in the other room. When he developed metta ̄ for some minutes, he had lust arising in his mind and so he got up and tried to go to his wife’s room fight- ing against the wall of his room which was bolted, but he forgot it. In consideration of this story the opposite sex should not be the object of the specific metta ̄-meditation but he or she can be the object of unspecific metta ̄-meditation. When you are skilled in metta ̄-meditation, you can develop metta ̄ towards the opposite sex.

# A Lady Meditator’s Experience

One lady who was a superintendent at a bank came to practise Vipassan ̄a Meditation for two months. She got a three months leave. After two months of Vipassan ̄a Meditation, she practised metta ̄-meditation. After she had practised metta ̄-Meditation for about two weeks, her concentration was very good. She felt happy, calm and composed. Her mind became clear, serene, pli- able and malleable. I, therefore, instructed her to develop metta ̄ towards a hostile person. Then, she remembered her senior of- ficer who was always finding fault with her. She did not like him. So I told her to develop metta ̄ towards her senior officer. She tried to feel metta ̄ for him by practising metta ̄-meditation. The next day in the interview she said she was successful in de- veloping metta ̄ towards her hostile person. After one month’s
8

metta ̄-meditation she went back home. After one week she came and told me about her success. When she went back home her brother told her that her senior officer visited her house and asked her brother about her health and her meditation, which he had never been done before. When she went to the office his attitude has changed and he did not find fault with her. So she judged that this is the benefit of metta ̄-meditation that she had practised for one month. So we can say that when a meditator is skilled in metta ̄-meditation he successfully develops metta ̄ to- wards a hostile person.

# About a Dead Person

A dead person should not be the object of the specific metta ̄- meditation. The Visudhimagga says that if you develop loving- kindness towards a dead person, you cannot attain either ac- cess or absorption concentration. It mentions a story of a young monk who developed metta ̄ towards his preceptor living in a dis- tant monastery. The young monk could not attain any concen- tration in his meditation. So, he went to a senior monk who was an Arahat living near his monastery and asked him why he did not attain any concentration in his meditation though he was skilful in metta ̄-meditation. The senior monk told him to seek the object. So the young monk went to the monastery where his preceptor lived. Then he found that the preceptor had passed away. He came to know that is the reason why he did not attain any concentration. Then he took another person as the object of metta ̄-meditation. He easily attained absortion concentration (jha ̄na).

# Who is the First Object?
Then we should know who should be the first object of metta ̄- meditation in the beginning. The Visudhimagga says as follows:
First of all it should be developed only towards one- self, saying repeatedly thus, “May I be happy and free from suffering,” or, “May I keep myself free from enmity, affliction and anxiety and live hap- pily1 ”.
So he should first, as example, pervade himself with loving-kindness. Next, after that, in order to pro- ceed easily, he can recollect such gifts, kind words, etc., as inspire love and endearment, such virtue, learning, etc., as inspire respect and reverence met with in a teacher or his equivalent or a preceptor or his equivalent, developing loving-kindness towards him in the way beginning “May this good man be happy and free from suffering”. With such person, of course, he attains absorption2.

# Breaking of the Barriers

But if this Bhikkhu does not rest content with just that much and wants to break down the barriers, he should next, after that, develop loving-kindness towards a very dearly loved friend, then towards a neutral person as a very dearly loved friend, then to- wards a hostile person as neutral. And while he does so, he should make his mind malleable and wieldy in each instance before passing on to the next.

Then, he should break down the barriers by prac- tising loving-kindness over and over again, accom- plishing mental impartiality towards the four persons, that is to say, himself, the dear person, the neutral person and then the hostile person.

The characteristic of it is this. Suppose this person is sitting in a place with a dear, a neutral, and a hostile person, himself being the fourth; then bandits come to him and say, “Venerable sir, give us a Bhikkhu”, and on being asked “Why”, they answer “So that we may kill him and use the blood of his throat as an of- fering”, then if that Bhikkhu thinks, “Let them take this one, or this one”, he has not broken down the barriers. And also if he thinks, “Let them take me but not these three,” he has not broken down the barriers either. Why? Because he seeks the harm of him whom he wishes to be taken and seeks the wel- fare of the others only. But it is when he does not see a single one among the four people to be given to the bandits and he directs his mind impartially towards himself and towards those three people that he has broken down the barriers.

# Free Development of Metta ̄-Meditation

The Visudhimagga, in the above paragraph, explains how to break the barrier (simasambheda) but any meditator can practise metta ̄-meditation just to have the feeling of loving-kindness in himself without breaking of barrier. He need not follow the order of development mentioned in the Visudhimagga.
So, first of all, he develops metta ̄ towards himself. After he has some feeling of metta ̄ in himself he should develop metta ̄ to- wards his teacher, preceptor or any equivalent person which is endowed with sila, sama ̄dhi and pañña. After that he can develop metta ̄ towards any person he has chosen for meditation. In this way he can cultivate metta ̄ towards one person after another or all beings in the universe. May all beings develop metta ̄ and be happy, peaceful and free from all kinds of suffering.
