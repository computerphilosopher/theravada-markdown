## CHAPTER I 


DESCRIPTION OF VIRTUE


(*Sīla-niddesa*)



\[I. INTRODUCTORY\]



[1.] \[1\]



"When a wise man, established well in virtue,\
Develops consciousness and understanding,\
Then as a bhikkhu ardent and sagacious\
He succeeds in disentangling this tangle" (S I 13).



This was said. But why was it said? While the Blessed One was living at
Sāvatthī,



it seems, a certain deity came to him in the night, and in order to do
away with his doubts, he asked this question:



"The inner tangle and the outer tangle---\
This generation is entangled in a tangle.\
And so I ask of Gotama this question:\
Who succeeds in disentangling this tangle?" (S I 13).



[2.]Here is the meaning in brief. *Tangle* is a term for the
network of craving. For that is a tangle in the sense of lacing
together, like the tangle called network of branches in bamboo thickets,
etc., because it goes on arising again and again up and down1 among the
objects \[of consciousness\] beginning with what is visible. But it is
called *the inner tangle and the outer tangle* because it arises \[as
craving\] for one's own requisites and another's, for one's own person
and another's, and for the internal and external bases \[for
consciousness\]. Since it arises in this way, *this generation is
entangled in a tangle.* As the bamboos, etc., are entangled by the
bamboo tangle, etc., so too this generation, in other words, this order
of living beings, is all entangled by the tangle of craving---the
meaning is that it is intertwined, interlaced by it. \[2\] And because
it is entangled like this, *so I ask of Gotama this question*, that is
why I ask this. He addressed the Blessed One by his clan name as
*Gotama. Who*



1\. "From a visible datum sometimes as far down as a mental datum, or
vice versa, following the order of the six kinds of objects of
consciousness as given in the teaching" (Vism-mhṭ 5, see XV.32).

[]



*succeeds in disentangling this tangle*: who may disentangle this tangle
that keeps the three kinds of existence entangled in this way?---What he
asks is, who is capable of disentangling it?



[3.]However, when questioned thus, the Blessed One, whose
knowledge of all things is unimpeded, deity of deities, excelling Sakka
(Ruler of Gods), excelling Brahmā, fearless in the possession of the
four kinds of perfect confidence, wielder of the ten powers, all-seer
with unobstructed knowledge, uttered this stanza in reply to explain the
meaning:



"When a wise man, established well in virtue,\
Develops consciousness and understanding,\
Then as a bhikkhu ardent and sagacious\
He succeeds in disentangling this tangle."



[4.] My task is now to set out the true sense, Divided into
virtue and the rest,\
Of this same verse composed by the Great Sage.\
There are here in the Victor's Dispensation\
Seekers gone forth from home to homelessness,\
And who although desiring purity\
Have no right knowledge of the sure straight way\
Comprising virtue and the other two,\
Right hard to find, that leads to purity---\
Who, though they strive, here gain no purity.\
To them I shall expound the comforting *Path\
Of Purification*, pure in expositions,\
Relying on the teaching of the dwellers\
In the Great Monastery;2 let all those\
Good men who do desire purity\
Listen intently to my exposition.



[5.]Herein, *purification* should be understood as Nibbāna,
which being devoid of all stains, is utterly pure. *The path of
purification* is the path to that purification; it is the means of
approach that is called the path. The meaning is, I shall expound that
path of purification.



[6.]In some instances this path of purification is taught by
insight alone,3 according as it is said:



2\. The Great Monastery (Mahāvihāra) at Anurādhapura in Sri Lanka.



3\. "The words  'insight alone' are meant to exclude not virtue, etc.,
but serenity (i.e. *jhāna*), which is the opposite number in the pair,
serenity and insight. This is for emphasis. But the word 'alone'
actually excludes only that concentration with distinction \[of jhāna\];
for concentration is classed as both access and absorption (see IV.32).
Taking this stanza as  the teaching for one whose vehicle is insight
does not imply that there is no concentration; for no insight comes
about without momentary  concentration. And again, insight should be
understood as the three contemplations of impermanence, pain, and
not-self; not contemplation of impermanence alone" (Vism-mhṭ 9--10).



[]



[]



"Formations are all impermanent:\
When he sees thus with understanding\
And turns away from what is ill,\
That is the path to purity" (Dhp 277). \[3\]



And in some instances by jhāna and understanding, according as it is
said:



"He is near unto Nibbāna\
In whom are jhāna and understanding" (Dhp 372).



And in some instances by deeds (kamma), etc., according as it is said:



"By deeds, vision and righteousness,\
By virtue, the sublimest life---\
By these are mortals purified,\
And not by lineage and wealth" (M III 262).



And in some instances by virtue, etc., according as it is said:



"He who is possessed of constant virtue,\
Who has understanding, and is concentrated,\
Who is strenuous and diligent as well,\
Will cross the flood so difficult to cross" (S I 53).



And in some instances by the foundations of mindfulness, etc., according
as it is said: "Bhikkhus, this path is the only way for the purification
of beings *...* for the realization of Nibbāna, that is to say, the four
foundations of mindfulness" (D II 290); and similarly in the case of the
right efforts, and so on. But in the answer to this question it is
taught by virtue and the other two.



[7.]Here is a brief commentary \[on the stanza\]. *Established
well in virtue*: standing on virtue. It is only one actually fulfilling
virtue who is here said to "stand on virtue." So the meaning here is
this: being established well in virtue by fulfilling virtue. *A man*: a
living being. *Wise*: possessing the kind of understanding that is born
of kamma by means of a rebirth-linking with triple root-cause. *Develops
consciousness and understanding*: develops both concentration and
insight. For it is concentration that is described here under the
heading of "consciousness," and insight under that of "understanding."4
*Ardent* (*ātāpin*): possessing energy. For it is energy that is called
"ardour" (*ātāpa*) in the sense of burning up and consuming
(*ātāpana-paritāpana*)* * defilements. He has that, thus he is ardent.
*Sagacious*:* * it is



4\. "'Develops' applies to both 'consciousness' and 'understanding.' But
are they mundane or supramundane? They are supramundane, because the
sublime goal is described; for one developing them is said to
disentangle the tangle of craving by cutting it off at the path moment,
and that is not mundane. But the mundane are included here too because
they immediately precede, since supramundane (see Ch. III n. 5)
concentration and insight are impossible without mundane concentration
and insight to precede them; for without the access and absorption
concentration in one whose vehicle is serenity, or without the momentary
concentration in one whose vehicle is insight, and without the gateways
to liberation (see XXI.66f.), the supramundane can never in either case
be reached" (Vism-mhṭ 13). "With triple root-cause" means with
non-greed, none-hate, and non-delusion.



[]



[]



understanding that is called "sagacity"; possessing that, is the
meaning. This word shows protective understanding. For understanding is
mentioned three times in the reply to the question. Herein, the first is
naïve understanding, the second is understanding consisting in insight,
while the third is the protective understanding that guides all affairs.
He sees fear (*bhayaṃ ikkhati*) in the round of rebirths, thus he is a
*bhikkhu. He succeeds in disentangling this tangle*: \[4\] Just as a man
standing on the ground and taking up a well-sharpened knife might
disentangle a great tangle of bamboos, so too, he---this bhikkhu who
possesses the six things, namely, this virtue, and this concentration
described under the heading of consciousness, and this threefold
understanding, and this ardour---standing on the ground of virtue and
taking up with the hand of protective-understanding exerted by the power
of energy the knife of insight-understanding well-sharpened on the stone
of concentration, might disentangle, cut away and demolish all the
tangle of craving that had overgrown his own life's continuity. But it
is at the moment of the path that he is said to be disentangling that
tangle; at the moment of fruition he has disentangled the tangle and is
worthy of the highest offerings in the world with its deities. That is
why the Blessed One said:



"When a wise man, established well in virtue,\
Develops consciousness and understanding,\
Then as a bhikkhu ardent and sagacious\
He succeeds in disentangling this tangle."



[8.] Herein there is nothing for him to do about the \[naïve\]
understanding on account of which he is called *wise*; for that has been
established in him simply by the influence of previous kamma. But the
words *ardent* and *sagacious* mean that by persevering with energy of
the kind here described and by acting in full awareness with
understanding he should, having become well established in virtue,
develop the serenity and insight that are described as *concentration*
and *understanding.* This is how the Blessed One shows the path of
purification under the headings of virtue, concentration, and
understanding there.



[9.]What has been shown so far is the three trainings, the
dispensation that is good in three ways, the necessary condition for the
threefold clear-vision, etc., the avoidance of the two extremes and the
cultivation of the middle way, the means to surmounting the states of
loss, etc., the abandoning of defilements in three aspects, prevention
of transgression etc., purification from the three kinds of defilements,
and the reason for the states of stream-entry and so on. How?



[10.]Here the training of higher virtue is shown by *virtue*;
the training of higher consciousness, by *concentration*;* * and the
training of higher understanding, by *understanding.*



*The dispensation's goodness in the beginning is shown by virtue.*
Because of the passage, "And what is the beginning of profitable things?
Virtue that is quite purified" (S V 143), and because of the passage
beginning, "The not doing of any evil" (Dhp 183), *virtue* is the
beginning of the dispensation. And that is good because it brings about
the special qualities of non-remorse,5 and so on. Its goodness in the



5\. One who is virtuous has nothing to be remorseful about.



[]



[]



middle is shown by *concentration*. \[5\] Because of the passage
beginning, "Entering upon the profitable" (Dhp 183), *concentration* is
the middle of the dispensation. And that is good because it brings about
the special qualities of supernormal power, and so on. Its goodness in
the end is shown by *understanding.* Because of the passage, "The
purifying of one's own mind---this is the Buddhas' dispensation" (Dhp
183), and because understanding is its culmination, *understanding * is
the end of the dispensation. And that is good because it brings about
equipoise with respect to the desired and the undesired. For this is
said:



"Just as a solid massive rock\
Remains unshaken by the wind,\
So too, in face of blame and praise\
The wise remain immovable" (Dhp 81).



[11.]Likewise the necessary condition for the triple
clear-vision is shown by *virtue.* For with the support of perfected
virtue one arrives at the three kinds of clear- vision, but nothing
besides that. The necessary condition for the six kinds of direct-
knowledge is shown by *concentration. * For with the support of
perfected concentration one arrives at the six kinds of
direct-knowledge, but nothing besides that. The necessary condition for
the categories of discrimination is shown by *understanding.* For with
the support of perfected understanding one arrives at the four kinds of
discrimination, but not for any other reason.6



And the avoidance of the extreme called devotion to indulgence of sense
desires is shown by *virtue.* The avoidance of the extreme called
devotion to mortification of self is shown by *concentration.* The
cultivation of the middle way is shown by *understanding.*



[12.]Likewise the means for surmounting the states of loss is
shown by *virtue*; the means for surmounting the element of sense
desires, by *concentration*; and the means for surmounting all becoming,
by *understanding.*



*And the abandoning of defilements by substitution of opposites is shown
by virtue*; that by suppression is shown by *concentration;* and that by
cutting off is shown by *understanding.*



[13.]Likewise prevention of defilements' transgression is shown
by *virtue*; prevention of obsession (by defilement) is shown by
*concentration*; prevention of inherent tendencies is shown by
*understanding.*



And purification from the defilement of misconduct is shown by *virtue*;
purification from the defilement of craving, by *concentration*; and
purification from the defilement of (false) views, by *understanding.*



6\. The three kinds of clear-vision are: recollection of past lives,
knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings (divine eye),
and knowledge of destruction of cankers (M I 22--23). The six kinds of
direct-knowledge are: knowledge of supernormal power, the divine ear
element, penetration of minds, recollection of past lives, knowledge of
the passing away and reappearance of beings, and knowledge of
destruction of cankers (M I 34--35). The four discriminations are those
of meaning, law, language, and intelligence (A II 160).



[]



[]



[14.]\[6\] Likewise the reason for the states of stream-entry
and once-return is shown by *virtue*; that for the state of non-return,
by *concentration*; that for Arahantship by *understanding.* For the
stream-enterer is called "perfected in the kinds of virtue"; and
likewise the once-returner. But the non-returner is called "perfected in
con- centration." And the Arahant is called "perfected in understanding"
(see A I 233).



[15.]So thus far these nine and other like triads of special
qualities have been shown, that is, the three trainings, the
dispensation that is good in three ways, the necessary condition for the
threefold clear-vision, the avoidance of the two extremes and the
cultivation of the middle way, the means for surmounting the states of
loss, etc., the abandoning of defilements in three aspects, prevention
of transgression, etc., purification from the three kinds of
defilements, and the reason for the states of stream-entry, and so on.



\[II. VIRTUE\]



[16.]However, even when this path of purification is shown in
this way under the headings of virtue, concentration and understanding,
each comprising various special qualities, it is still only shown
extremely briefly. And so since that is insufficient to help all, there
is, in order to show it in detail, the following set of questions
dealing in the first place with virtue:



[(i)] What is virtue?



[(ii)] In what sense is it virtue?



[(iii)] What are its characteristic, function, manifestation,
and proximate



cause?



[(iv)] What are the benefits of virtue?



[(v)] How many kinds of virtue are there?



[(vi)] What is the defiling of it?



[(viii)] What is the cleansing of it?



[17.]Here are the answers:



[(i)] *WHAT IS VIRTUE?* It is the states beginning with
volition present in one who abstains from killing living things, etc.,
or in one who fulfils the practice of the duties. For this is said in
the Paṭisambhidā: "What is virtue? There is virtue as volition, virtue
as consciousness-concomitant,7 virtue as restraint, \[7\] virtue as non-
transgression" (Paṭis I 44).



Herein, *virtue as volition* is the volition present in one who abstains
from killing living things, etc., or in one who fulfils the practice of
the duties. *Virtue as consciousness- concomitant* is the abstinence in
one who abstains from killing living things, and so on. Furthermore,
*virtue as volition* is the seven volitions \[that accompany the first
seven\] of the \[ten\] courses of action (kamma) in one who abandons the
killing of living things, and so on. *Virtue as
consciousness-concomitant* is the \[three remaining\] states consisting
of non-covetousness, non-ill will, and right view, stated in the way
beginning, "Abandoning covetousness, he dwells with a mind free from
covetousness" (D I 71).



7\. "Consciousness-concomitants" (*cetasikā*) is a collective term for
feeling, perception, and formation, variously subdivided; in other
words, aspects of mentality that arise together with consciousness.



[]



[]



[18.]*Virtue as restraint* should be understood here as
restraint in five ways: restraint by the rules of the community
(*pātimokkha*)*,* restraint by mindfulness, restraint by knowledge,
restraint by patience, and restraint by energy. Herein, "restraint by
the Pātimokkha" is this: "He is furnished, fully furnished, with this
Pātimokkha restraint. (Vibh 246)" "Restraint by mindfulness" is this:
"He guards the eye faculty, enters upon restraint of the eye faculty" (D
I 70). "Restraint by knowledge" is this:



"The currents in the world that flow, Ajita,"



said the Blessed One,



"Are stemmed by means of mindfulness;\
Restraint of currents I proclaim,\
By understanding they are dammed" (Sn 1035);



and use of requisites is here combined with this. But what is called
"restraint by patience" is that given in the way beginning, "He is one
who bears cold and heat" (M I 10). And what is called "restraint by
energy" is that given in the way beginning, "He does not endure a
thought of sense desires when it arises" (M I 11); purification of
livelihood is here combined with this. So this fivefold restraint, and
the abstinence, in clansmen who dread evil, from any chance of
transgression met with, should all be understood to be "virtue as
restraint."



*Virtue as non-transgression* is the non-transgression, by body or
speech, of precepts



of virtue that have been undertaken.



This, in the first place, is the answer to the question, "What is
virtue?" \[8\] Now,



as to the rest---



[19.](ii) I*N WHAT SENSE IS IT VIRTUE?* It is virtue (*sīla*)
in the sense of composing (*sīlana*).8 What is this composing? It is
either a coordinating (*samādhāna*)*, * meaning non- inconsistency of
bodily action, etc., due to virtuousness; or it is an upholding
(*upadhāraṇa*),8 meaning a state of basis (*ādhāra*) owing to its
serving as foundation for profitable states. For those who understand
etymology admit only these two meanings. Others, however, comment on the
meaning here in the way beginning, "The meaning of virtue (*sīla*) is
the meaning of head (*sira*)*,* the meaning of virtue is the meaning of
cool (*sītala*)."



[20.] (iii) Now, *WHAT ARE ITS CHARACTERISTIC, FUNCTION,
MANIFESTATION, AND PROXIMATE CAUSE?* Here:



The characteristic of it is composing\
Even when analyzed in various ways,\
As visibility is of visible data\
Even when analyzed in various ways.



Just as visibleness is the characteristic of the visible-data base even
when analyzed into the various categories of blue, yellow, etc., because
even when analyzed into these categories it does not exceed
visible-ness, so also this same composing, described above as the
coordinating of bodily action, etc., and as the foundation of



8\. *Sīlana* and *upadhāraṇa* in this meaning (cf. Ch. I, §141 and
*sandhāraṇa*, XIV.61) are not in PED.



[]



[]



profitable states, is the characteristic of virtue even when analyzed
into the various categories of volition, etc., because even when
analyzed into these categories it does not exceed the state of
coordination and foundation.



[21.]While such is its characteristic:



Its function has a double sense:\
*Action* to stop misconduct, then\
*Achievement* as the quality\
Of blamelessness in virtuous men.



So what is called virtue should be understood to have the function
(nature) of stopping misconduct as its function (nature) in the sense of
action, and a blameless function (nature) as its function (nature) in
the sense of achievement. For under \[these headings of\]
characteristic, etc., it is action (*kicca*) or it is achievement
(*sampatti*) that is called "function" (*rasa---*nature).



[22.] Now, virtue, so say those who know, Itself as purity will
show;\
And for its proximate cause they tell\
The pair, conscience and shame, as well. \[9\]



This virtue is manifested as the kinds of purity stated thus: "Bodily
purity, verbal purity, mental purity" (A I 271); it is manifested, comes
to be apprehended, as a pure state. But conscience and shame are said by
those who know to be its proximate cause; its near reason, is the
meaning. For when conscience and shame are in existence, virtue arises
and persists; and when they are not, it neither arises nor persists.



This is how virtue's characteristic, function, manifestation, and
proximate cause,



should be understood.



[23.](iv) *WHAT  ARE  THE  BENEFITS  OF  VIRTUE?* Its benefits
are the acquisition of the several special qualities beginning with
non-remorse. For this is said: "Ānanda, profitable habits (virtues) have
non-remorse as their aim and non-remorse as their benefit" (A V 1). Also
it is said further: "Householder, there are these five benefits for the
virtuous in the perfecting of virtue. What five? Here, householder, one
who is virtuous, possessed of virtue, obtains a large fortune as a
consequence of diligence; this is the first benefit for the virtuous in
the perfecting of virtue. Again, of one who is virtuous, possessed of
virtue, a fair name is spread abroad; this is the second benefit for the
virtuous in the perfecting of virtue. Again, whenever one who is
virtuous, possessed of virtue, enters an assembly, whether of khattiyas
(warrior- nobles) or brahmans or householders or ascetics, he does so
without fear or hesitation; this is the third benefit for the virtuous
in the perfecting of virtue. Again, one who is virtuous, possessed of
virtue, dies unconfused; this is the fourth benefit for the virtuous in
the perfecting of virtue. Again, one who is virtuous, possessed of
virtue, on the breakup of the body, after death, reappears in a happy
destiny, in the heavenly world; this is the fifth benefit for the
virtuous in the perfecting of virtue" (D II 86). There are also the many
benefits of virtue beginning with being dear and loved and ending with
destruction of cankers described in the passage beginning, "If a bhikkhu
should wish, 'May I be dear to my fellows in the life of



[]



[]



purity and loved by them, held in respect and honoured by them,' let him
perfect the virtues" (M I 33). This is how virtue has as its benefits
the several special qualities beginning with non-remorse. \[10\]



[24.]Furthermore:



Dare anyone a limit place\
On benefits that virtue brings,\
Without which virtue clansmen find\
No footing in the dispensation?



No Ganges, and no Yamunā\
No Sarabhū, Sarassathī,\
Or flowing Aciravatī,\
Or noble River of Mahī,\
Is able to wash out the stain\
In things that breathe here in the world;\
For only virtue's water can\
Wash out the stain in living things.



No breezes that come bringing rain,\
No balm of yellow sandalwood,\
No necklaces beside, or gems\
Or soft effulgence of moonbeams,\
Can here avail to calm and soothe\
Men's fevers in this world; whereas\
This noble, this supremely cool,\
Well-guarded virtue quells the flame.



Where is there to be found the scent\
That can with virtue's scent compare,\
And that is borne against the wind\
As easily as with it? Where\
Can such another stair be found\
That climbs, as virtue does, to heaven?\
Or yet another door that gives\
Onto the City of Nibbāna?



Shine as they may, there are no kings\
Adorned with jewellery and pearls\
That shine as does a man restrained\
Adorned with virtue's ornament.\
Virtue entirely does away\
With dread of self-blame and the like;\
Their virtue to the virtuous\
Gives gladness always by its fame.



From this brief sketch it may be known\
How virtue brings reward, and how\
This root of all good qualities\
Robs of its power every fault.



[]



[]



[25.] (v) Now, here is the answer to the question, *HOW  MANY 
KINDS  OF  VIRTUE  ARE THERE?*



[1.]Firstly all this virtue is of one kind by reason of its own
characteristic of composing.



[2.]It is of two kinds as keeping and avoiding.



[3.]Likewise as that of good behaviour and that of the
beginning of the life of purity,



[4.]As abstinence and non-abstinence,



[5.]As dependent and independent,



[6.]As temporary and lifelong,



[7.]As limited and unlimited,



[8.]As mundane and supramundane. \[11\]



[9.]It is of three kinds as inferior, medium, and superior.



[10.]Likewise as giving precedence to self, giving precedence
to the world, and giving precedence to the Dhamma,



[11.]As adhered to, not adhered to, and tranquillized.



[12.]As purified, unpurified, and dubious.



[13.]As that of the trainer, that of the non-trainer, and that
of the neither-trainer- nor-non-trainer.



[14.]It is of four kinds as partaking of diminution, of
stagnation, of distinction, of penetration.



[15.]Likewise as that of bhikkhus, of bhikkhunīs, of the
not-fully-admitted, of the laity,



[16.]As natural, customary, necessary, due to previous causes,



[17.]As virtue of Pātimokkha restraint, of restraint of sense
faculties, of



purification of livelihood, and that concerning requisites.



[18.]It is of five kinds as virtue consisting in limited
purification, etc.; for this is said in the Paṭisambhidā: "Five kinds of
virtue: virtue consisting in limited purification, virtue consisting in
unlimited purification, virtue consisting in fulfilled purification,
virtue consisting in unadhered-to purification, virtue consisting in
tranquillized purification" (Paṭis I 42).



[19.]Likewise as abandoning, refraining, volition, restraint,
and non-transgression.



[26.] *1.* Herein, in the section dealing with that of one
kind, the meaning should be understood as already stated.



*2.* In the section dealing with that of two kinds: fulfilling a
training precept announced by the Blessed One thus: "This should be
done" is *keeping*; not doing what is prohibited by him thus: "This
should not be done" is *avoiding*. Herein, the word- meaning is this:
they keep (*caranti*) within that, they proceed as people who fulfil the
virtues, thus it is keeping (*cāritta*); they preserve, they protect,
they avoid, thus it is



[]



[]



*avoiding*. Herein, *keeping* is accomplished by faith and energy;
*avoiding*, by faith and mindfulness. This is how it is of two kinds as
keeping and avoiding.



[27.] *3.* In the second dyad good behaviour is the best kind
of behaviour. Good behaviour itself is *that of good behaviour*; or what
is announced for the sake of good behaviour is *that of good behaviour*.
This is a term for virtue other than that which has livelihood as
eighth.9 It is the initial stage of the life of purity consisting in the
path, thus it is *that of the beginning of the life of purity*. This is
a term for the virtue that has livelihood as eighth. It is the initial
stage of the path because it has actually to be purified in the prior
stage too. Hence it is said: "But his bodily action, his verbal action,
and his livelihood have already been purified earlier" (M III 289). Or
the training precepts called "lesser and minor" (D II 154) \[12\] are
*that of good behaviour*; the rest are *that of the beginning of the
life of purity*. Or what is included in the Double Code (the bhikkhus'
and bhikkhunīs' Pātimokkha) is *that of the beginning of the life of
purity*; and that included in the duties set out in the Khandhakas \[of
Vinaya\] is *that of good behaviour*. Through its perfection *that of
the beginning of the life of purity* comes to be perfected. Hence it is
said also "that this bhikkhu shall fulfil the state consisting in the
beginning of the life of purity without having fulfilled the state
consisting in good behaviour---that is not possible" (A III 14--15). So
it is of two kinds as that of good behaviour and that of the beginning
of the life of purity.



[28.]In the third dyad virtue as *abstinence* is
simply abstention from killing living things, etc.; the other kinds
consisting in volition, etc., are virtue as *non-abstinence.* So it is
of two kinds as abstinence and non-abstinence.



[29.]In the fourth dyad there are two kinds of
dependence: dependence through craving and dependence through \[false\]
views. Herein, that produced by one who wishes for a fortunate kind of
becoming thus, "Through this virtuous conduct \[rite\] I shall become a
\[great\] deity or some \[minor\] deity" (M I 102), is *dependent*
through craving. That produced through such \[false\] view about
purification as "Purification is through virtuous conduct" (Vibh 374) is
*dependent* through \[false\] view. But the supramundane, and the
mundane that is the prerequisite for the aforesaid supramundane, are
*independent.* So it is of two kinds as dependent and independent.



[30.] *6.* In the fifth dyad *temporary* virtue is that
undertaken after deciding on a time limit. *Lifelong* virtue is that
practiced in the same way but undertaking it for as long as life lasts.
So it is of two kinds as temporary and lifelong.



[31.]In the sixth dyad the *limited* is that seen
to be limited by gain, fame, relatives, limbs, or life. The opposite is
*unlimited.* And this is said in the Paṭisambhidā: "What is the virtue
that has a limit? There is virtue that has gain as its limit, there is
virtue that has fame as its limit, there is virtue that has relatives as
its limit, there is virtue that has limbs as its limit, there is virtue
that has life as its limit. What is virtue that



9\. The three kinds of profitable bodily kamma or action (not killing or
stealing or indulging in sexual misconduct), the four kinds of
profitable verbal kamma or action (refraining from lying, malicious
speech, harsh speech, and gossip), and right livelihood as the eighth.



[]



[]



has gain as its limit? Here someone with gain as cause, with gain as
condition, with gain as reason, transgresses a training precept as
undertaken: that virtue has gain as its limit" (Paṭis I 43), \[13\] and
the rest should be elaborated in the same way. Also in the answer
dealing with the *unlimited* it is said: "What is virtue that does not
have gain as its limit? Here someone does not, with gain as cause, with
gain as condition, with gain as reason, even arouse the thought of
transgressing a training precept as undertaken, how then shall he
actually transgress it? That virtue does not have gain as its limit"
(Paṭis I 44), and the rest should be elaborated in the same way. So it
is of two kinds as limited and unlimited.



[32.]In the seventh dyad all virtue subject to
cankers is *mundane*; that not subject to cankers is *supramundane*.
Herein, the *mundane* brings about improvement in future becoming and is
a prerequisite for the escape from becoming, according as it is said:
"Discipline is for the purpose of restraint, restraint is for the
purpose of non- remorse, non-remorse is for the purpose of gladdening,
gladdening is for the purpose of happiness, happiness is for the purpose
of tranquillity, tranquillity is for the purpose of bliss, bliss is for
the purpose of concentration, concentration is for the purpose of
correct knowledge and vision, correct knowledge and vision is for the
purpose of dispassion, dispassion is for the purpose of fading away \[of
greed\], fading away is for the purpose of deliverance, deliverance is
for the purpose of knowledge and vision of deliverance, knowledge and
vision of deliverance is for the purpose of complete extinction \[of
craving, etc.\] through not clinging. Talk has that purpose, counsel has
that purpose, support has that purpose, giving ear has that purpose,
that is to say, the liberation of the mind through not clinging" (Vin V
164). The *supramundane* brings about the escape from becoming and is
the plane of reviewing knowledge. So it is of two kinds as mundane and
supramundane.



[33.] *9.* In the first of the triads the *inferior* is
produced by inferior zeal, \[purity of\] consciousness, energy, or
inquiry; the *medium* is produced by medium zeal, etc.; the *superior*,
by superior (zeal, and so on). That undertaken out of desire for fame is
*inferior*;* * that undertaken out of desire for the fruits of merit is
*medium*; that undertaken for the sake of the noble state thus, "This
has to be done" is *superior.* Or again, that defiled by self-praise and
disparagement of others, etc., thus, "I am possessed of virtue, but
these other bhikkhus are ill-conducted and evil-natured" (M I 193), is
*inferior*; undefiled mundane virtue is *medium*; supramundane is
*superior*. Or again, that motivated by craving, the purpose of which is
to enjoy continued existence, is *inferior*; that practiced for the
purpose of one's own deliverance is *medium*; the virtue of the
perfections practiced for the deliverance of all beings is *superior.*
So it is of three kinds as inferior, medium, and superior.



[34.]In the second triad that practiced out of
self-regard by one who regards self and desires to abandon what is
unbecoming to self \[14\] is virtue *giving precedence to self*. That
practiced out of regard for the world and out of desire to ward off the
censure of the world is virtue *giving precedence to the world*. That
practiced out of regard for the Dhamma and out of desire to honour the
majesty of the Dhamma is virtue *giving precedence to the Dhamma*. So it
is of three kinds as giving precedence to self, and so on.



[35.]In the third triad the virtue that in the
dyads was called dependent (no. 5) is *adhered-to* because it is
adhered-to through craving and \[false\] view. That practiced



[]



[]



by the magnanimous ordinary man as the prerequisite of the path, and
that associated with the path in trainers, are *not-adhered-to.* That
associated with trainers' and non-trainers' fruition is *tranquillized.*
So it is of three kinds as adhered-to, and so on.



[36.]In the fourth triad that fulfilled by one
who has committed no offence or has made amends after committing one is
*pure*. So long as he has not made amends after committing an offence it
is *impure*. Virtue in one who is dubious about whether a thing
constitutes an offence or about what grade of offence has been committed
or about whether he has committed an offence is *dubious*. Herein, the
meditator should purify impure virtue. If dubious, he should avoid cases
about which he is doubtful and should get his doubts cleared up. In this
way his mind will be kept at rest. So it is of three kinds as pure, and
so on.



[37.]In the fifth triad the virtue associated
with the four paths and with the \[first\] three fruitions *is that of
the trainer.* That associated with the fruition of Arahantship *is that
of the non-trainer.* The remaining kinds are *that of the neither-
trainer-nor-non-trainer.* So it is of three kinds as that of the
trainer, and so on.



[38.]But in the world the nature of such and such beings is
called their "habit" (*sīla*) of which they say: "This one is of happy
habit (*sukha-sīla*), this one is of unhappy habit, this one is of
quarrelsome habit, this one is of dandified habit." Because of that it
is said in the Paṭisambhidā figuratively: "Three kinds of virtue
(habit): profitable virtue, unprofitable virtue, indeterminate virtue"
(Paṭis I 44). So it is also called of three kinds as profitable, and so
on. Of these, the unprofitable is not included here since it has nothing
whatever to do with the headings beginning with the characteristic,
which define virtue in the sense intended in this \[chapter\]. So the
threefoldness should be understood only in the way already stated.



[39.]In the first of the tetrads:



The unvirtuous he cultivates,\
He visits not the virtuous,\
And in his ignorance he sees\
No fault in a transgression here, \[15\]\
With wrong thoughts often in his mind\
His faculties he will not guard---\
Virtue in such a constitution\
Comes to *partake of diminution.*



But he whose mind is satisfied.\
With virtue that has been achieved,\
Who never thinks to stir himself\
And take a meditation subject up,\
Contented with mere virtuousness,\
Nor striving for a higher state---\
His virtue bears the appellation\
Of that partaking of stagnation.



But who, possessed of virtue, strives\
With concentration for his aim---



[]



[]



That bhikkhu's virtue in its function\
Is called partaking of distinction.



Who finds mere virtue not enough\
But has dispassion for his goal---\
His virtue through such aspiration\
Comes to partake of penetration.



So it is of four kinds as partaking of diminution, and so on.



[40.]In the second tetrad there are training
precepts announced for bhikkhus to keep irrespective of what is
announced for bhikkhunīs. This is the virtue *of bhikkhus*. There are
training precepts announced for bhikkhunīs to keep irrespective of what
is announced for bhikkhus. This is the virtue of *bhikkhunīs*. The ten
precepts of virtue for male and female novices are the virtue *of the
not fully admitted*. The five training precepts---ten when possible---as
a permanent undertaking and eight as the factors of the Uposatha Day,10
for male and female lay followers are the virtue *of the laity*. So it
is of four kinds as the virtue of bhikkhus, and so on.



[41.]In the third tetrad the non-transgression
on the part of Uttarakuru human beings is *natural virtue*. Each clan's
or locality's or sect's own rules of conduct are *customary virtue*. The
virtue of the Bodhisatta's mother described thus: "It is the necessary
rule, Ānanda, that when the Bodhisatta has descended into his mother's
womb, no thought of men that is connected with the cords of sense desire
comes to her" (D II 13), is *necessary virtue*. But the virtue of such
pure beings as Mahā Kassapa, etc., and of the Bodhisatta in his various
births is virtue *due to previous causes*. So it is of four kinds as
natural virtue, and so on.



[42.]In the fourth tetrad:



\(a\) The virtue described by the Blessed One thus: "Here a bhikkhu
dwells restrained with the Pātimokkha restraint, possessed of the
\[proper\] conduct and resort, and seeing fear in the slightest fault,
he trains himself by undertaking the precepts of training, (Vibh 244)"
is *virtue of Pātimokkha restraint*.



\(b\) That described thus: "On seeing a visible object with the eye,
\[16\] he apprehends neither the signs nor the particulars through
which, if he left the eye faculty unguarded, evil and unprofitable
states of covetousness and grief might invade him; he enters upon the
way of its restraint, he guards the eye faculty, undertakes the
restraint of the eye faculty. On hearing a sound with the ear ... On
smelling an odour with the nose ... On tasting a flavour with the tongue
... On



10\. *Uposatha* (der. from *upavasati*, to observe or to prepare) is the
name for the day of "fasting" or "vigil" observed on the days of the new
moon, waxing half moon, full moon, and waning half moon. On these days
it is customary  for laymen to undertake the Eight Precepts (*sīla*) or
Five Precepts. On the new-moon and full-moon days the Pātimokkha (see
note 11) is recited by bhikkhus. The two quarter-moon days are called
the "eighth of the half moon." The Full-moon day is called the
"fifteenth" (i.e. fifteen days from the new moon) and is the last day of
the lunar month. That of the new moon is called the "fourteenth" when it
is the second and fourth new moon of the four- month season (i.e.
fourteen days from the full moon), the other two are called the
"fifteenth." This compensates for the irregularities of the lunar
period.



[]

touching a tangible object with the body ... On cognizing a mental
object with the mind, he apprehends neither the signs nor the
particulars through which, if he left the mind faculty unguarded, evil
and unprofitable states of covetousness and grief might invade him; he
enters upon the way of its restraint, he guards the mind faculty,
undertakes the restraint of the mind faculty (M I 180), is *virtue of
restraint of the sense faculties*.



[(c)] Abstinence from such wrong livelihood as entails
transgression of the six training precepts announced with respect to
livelihood and entails the evil states beginning with "Scheming,
talking, hinting, belittling, pursuing gain with gain" (M II 75) is
*virtue of livelihood purification*.



\(d\) Use of the four requisites that is purified by the reflection
stated in the way beginning, "Reflecting wisely, he uses the robe only
for protection from cold" (M I 10) is called *virtue concerning
requisites*.



[43.]Here is an explanatory exposition together with a word
commentary starting from the beginning.



\(a\) *Here*: in this dispensation. *A bhikkhu*: a clansman who has gone
forth out of faith and is so styled because he sees fear in the round of
rebirths (*saṃsāre bhayaṃ ikkhanatā*) or because he wears cloth garments
that are torn and pieced together, and so on.



*Restrained with the Pātimokkha restraint*: here "Pātimokkha" (Rule of
the Community)11 is the virtue of the training precepts; for it frees
(*mokkheti*) him who protects (*pāti*) it, guards it, it sets him free
(*mocayati*) from the pains of the states of loss, etc., that is why it
is called *Pātimokkha*. "Restraint" is restraining; this is a term for
bodily and verbal non-transgression. The Pātimokkha itself as restraint
is "Pātimokkha restraint." "Restrained with the Pātimokkha restraint" is
restrained by means of the restraint consisting in that Pātimokkha; he
has it, possesses it, is the meaning. *Dwells*: bears himself in one of
the postures. \[17\]



[44.] The meaning of *possessed of*  \[*the proper*\] *conduct
and resort*, etc., should be understood in the way in which it is given
in the text. For this is said: "Possessed of \[the proper\] conduct and
resort: there is \[proper\] conduct and improper conduct. Herein, what
is improper conduct? Bodily transgression, verbal transgression, bodily
and verbal transgression---this is called improper conduct. Also all
unvirtuousness is improper conduct. Here someone makes a livelihood by
gifts of bamboos, or by gifts of leaves, or by gifts of flowers, fruits,
bathing powder, and tooth sticks, or by flattery, or by bean-soupery, or
by fondling, or by going on errands on foot, or by one or other of the
sorts of wrong livelihood condemned by the Buddhas---this is called
improper conduct. Herein, what is \[proper\] conduct? Bodily



11\. The Suttavibhaṅga, the first book of the Vinaya Piṭaka, contains in
its two parts the 227 rules for bhikkhus and the rules for bhikkhunīs,
who have received the admission (*upasampadā*), together with accounts
of the incidents that led to the announcement of the rules, the
modification of the rules and the explanations of them. The bare rules
themselves form the Pātimokkha for bhikkhus and that for bhikkhunīs.
They are also known as the "two codes" (*dve mātikā*). The Pātimokkha is
recited by bhikkhus on the Uposatha days of the full moon and new moon.



[]



[]



non-transgression, verbal non-transgression, bodily and verbal
non-transgression--- this is called \[proper\] conduct. Also all
restraint through virtue is \[proper\] conduct. Here someone "does not
make a livelihood by gifts of bamboos, or by gifts of leaves, or by
gifts of flowers, fruits, bathing powder, and tooth sticks, or by
flattery, or by bean-soupery, or by fondling, or by going on errands on
foot, or by one or other of the sorts of wrong livelihood condemned by
the Buddhas---this is called \[proper\] conduct."



[45.]"\[Proper\] resort: there is \[proper\] resort and
improper resort. Herein, what is improper resort? Here someone has
prostitutes as resort, or he has widows, old maids, eunuchs, bhikkhunīs,
or taverns as resort; or he dwells associated with kings, kings'
ministers, sectarians, sectarians' disciples, in unbecoming association
with laymen; or he cultivates, frequents, honours, such families as are
faithless, untrusting, abusive and rude, who wish harm, wish ill, wish
woe, wish no surcease of bondage, for bhikkhus and bhikkhunīs, for male
and female devotees \[18\]---this is called improper resort. Herein,
what is \[proper\] resort? Here someone does not have prostitutes as
resort ... or taverns as resort; he does not dwell associated with kings
... sectarians' disciples, in unbecoming association with laymen; he
cultivates, frequents, honours, such families as are faithful and
trusting, who are a solace, where the yellow cloth glows, where the
breeze of sages blows, who wish good, wish well, wish joy, wish surcease
of bondage, for bhikkhus and bhikkhunīs, for male and female
devotees---this is called \[proper\] resort. Thus he is furnished with,
fully furnished with, provided with, fully provided with, supplied with,
possessed of, endowed with, this \[proper\] conduct and this \[proper\]
resort. Hence it is said, 'Possessed of \[the proper\] conduct and
resort'" (Vibh 246--47).



[46.]Furthermore, \[proper\] conduct and resort should also be
understood here in the following way; for improper conduct is twofold as
bodily and verbal. Herein, what is bodily improper conduct? "Here
someone acts disrespectfully before the Community, and he stands
jostling elder bhikkhus, sits jostling them, stands in front of them,
sits in front of them, sits on a high seat, sits with his head covered,
talks standing up, talks waving his arms ... walks with sandals while
elder bhikkhus walk without sandals, walks on a high walk while they
walk on a low walk, walks on a walk while they walk on the ground ...
stands pushing elder bhikkhus, sits pushing them, prevents new bhikkhus
from getting a seat ... and in the bath house ... without asking elder
bhikkhus he puts wood on \[the stove\] ... bolts the door ... and at the
bathing place he enters the water jostling elder bhikkhus, enters it in
front of them, bathes jostling them, bathes in front of them, comes out
jostling them, comes out in front of them ... and entering inside a
house he goes jostling elder bhikkhus, goes in front of them, pushing
forward he goes in front of them ... and where families have inner
private screened rooms in which the women of the family ... the girls of
the family, sit, there he enters abruptly, and he strokes a child's
head" (Nidd I 228--29). This is called bodily improper conduct.



[47.]Herein, what is verbal improper conduct? "Here someone
acts disrespectfully before the Community. Without asking elder bhikkhus
he talks on the Dhamma, answers questions, recites the Pātimokkha, talks
standing up, \[19\] talks waving his arms ... having entered inside a
house, he speaks to a woman or a girl thus: 'You, so-

and-so of such-and-such a clan, what is there? Is there rice gruel? Is
there cooked rice? Is there any hard food to eat? What shall we drink?
What hard food shall we eat? What soft food shall we eat? Or what will
you give me?'---he chatters like this" (Nidd I 230). This is called
verbal improper conduct.



[48.] Proper conduct should be understood in the opposite sense
to that. Furthermore, a bhikkhu is respectful, deferential, possessed of
conscience and shame, wears his inner robe properly, wears his upper
robe properly, his manner inspires confidence whether in moving forwards
or backwards, looking ahead or aside, bending or stretching, his eyes
are downcast, he has (a good) deportment, he guards the doors of his
sense faculties, knows the right measure in eating, is devoted to
wakefulness, possesses mindfulness and full awareness, wants little, is
contented, is strenuous, is a careful observer of good behaviour, and
treats the teachers with great respect. This is called (proper) conduct.



This firstly is how (proper) conduct should be understood.



[49.](Proper) resort is of three kinds: (proper) resort as
support, (proper) resort as guarding, and (proper) resort as anchoring.
Herein, what is (proper) resort as support? A good friend who exhibits
the instances of talk,12 in whose presence one hears what has not been
heard, corrects what has been heard, gets rid of doubt, rectifies one's
view, and gains confidence; or by training under whom one grows in
faith, virtue, learning, generosity and understanding---this is called
(*proper*) *resort as support.*



[50.]What is (proper) resort as guarding? Here "A bhikkhu,
having entered inside a house, having gone into a street, goes with
downcast eyes, seeing the length of a plough yoke, restrained, not
looking at an elephant, not looking at a horse, a carriage, a
pedestrian, a woman, a man, not looking up, not looking down, not
staring this way and that" (Nidd I 474). This is called (proper) resort
as guarding.



[51.]What is (proper) resort as anchoring? It is the four
foundations of mindfulness on which the mind is anchored; for this is
said by the Blessed One: "Bhikkhus, what is a bhikkhu's resort, his own
native place? It is these four foundations of mindfulness" (S V 148).
This is called (*proper*) *resort as anchoring*.



Being thus furnished with ... endowed with, this (proper) conduct and
this (proper) resort, he is also on that account called "one possessed
of (proper) conduct and resort." \[20\]



[52.]*Seeing fear in the slightest fault* (§42): one who has
the habit (*sīla*) of seeing fear in faults of the minutest measure, of
such kinds as unintentional contravening of a minor training rule of the
Pātimokkha, or the arising of unprofitable thoughts. *He trains himself
by undertaking* (*samādāya*) *the precepts of training*:* * whatever
there is among the precepts of training to be trained in, in all that he
trains by taking it up



12\. The "ten instances of talk" (*dasa kathāvatthūni*) refer to the
kinds of talk given in the Suttas thus: "Such talk as is concerned with
effacement, as favours the heart's release, as leads to complete
dispassion, fading, cessation, peace, direct knowledge, enlightenment,
Nibbāna, that is to say: talk on wanting little, contentment, seclusion,
aloofness from contact, strenuousness, virtue, concentration,
understanding, deliverance, knowledge and vision of deliverance" (M I
145; III 113).



[]



[]



rightly (*sammā ādāya*).* * And here, as far as the words, "one
restrained by the Pātimokkha restraint," virtue of Pātimokkha restraint
is shown by discourse in terms of persons.13 But all that beginning with
the words, "possessed of \[proper\] conduct and resort" should be
understood as said in order to show the way of practice that perfects
that virtue in him who so practices it.



[53.](b) Now, as regards the virtue of restraint of faculties
shown next to that in the way beginning, "on seeing a visible object
with the eye," herein *he * is a bhikkhu established in the virtue of
Pātimokkha restraint. *On seeing a visible object with the eye*: on
seeing a visible object with the eye-consciousness that is capable of
seeing visible objects and has borrowed the name "eye" from its
instrument. But the Ancients (*porāṇā*) said: "The eye does not see a
visible object because it has no mind. The mind does not see because it
has no eyes. But when there is the impingement of door and object he
sees by means of the consciousness that has eye-sensitivity as its
physical basis. Now, (an idiom) such as this is called an 'accessory
locution' (*sasambhārakathā*), like 'He shot him with his bow,' and so
on. So the meaning here is this: 'On seeing a visible object with
eye-consciousness.'"14



[54.]*Apprehends neither the signs*: he does not apprehend the
sign of woman or man, or any sign that is a basis for defilement such as
the sign of beauty, etc.; he stops at what is merely seen. *Nor the
particulars*: he does not apprehend any aspect classed as hand, foot,
smile, laughter, talk, looking ahead, looking aside, etc., which has
acquired the name "particular" (*anubyañjana*) because of its
particularizing (*anu anu byañjanato*) defilements, because of its
making them manifest themselves.



13\. See Ch. IV n. 27.\



14\. "'*On seeing a visible object with the eye*": if the eye were to
see the visible object, then (organs) belonging to other kinds of
consciousness would see too; but that is not so. Why? Because the eye
has no thought (*acetanattā*). And then, were consciousness itself to
see a visible object, it would see it even behind a wall because of
being independent of sense resistance (*appaṭighabhāvato*); but that is
not so either because there is no seeing in all kinds of consciousness.
And herein, it is consciousness dependent on the eye that sees, not just
any kind. And that does not arise with respect to what is enclosed by
walls, etc., where light is excluded. But where there is no exclusion of
light, as in the case of a crystal or a mass of cloud, there it does
arise even with respect to what is enclosed by them. So it is as a basis
of consciousness that the eye sees. "'*When there is the impingement of
door and object*': what is intended is: when a visible datum as object
has come into the eye's focus. '*One sees*': one looks (*oloketi*); for
when the consciousness that has eye-sensitivity as its material support
is disclosing (*obhāsente*) by means of the special quality of its
support a visible datum as object that is assisted by light (*āloka*),
then it is said that a person possessed of that sees the visible datum.
And here the illuminating is the revealing of the visible datum
according to its individual essence, in other words, the apprehending of
it experientially (*paccakkhato*). "Here it is the '*sign of woman*'
because it is the cause of perceiving as 'woman' all such things as the
shape that is grasped under the heading of the visible data
(materiality) invariably found in a female continuity, the
un-clear-cut-ness (*avisadatā*) of the flesh of the breasts, the
beardlessness of the face, the use of cloth to bind the hair, the
un-clear-cut stance, walk, and so on. The '*sign of man*' is in the
opposite sense.

He only apprehends what is really there. Like the Elder Mahā Tissa who
dwelt at Cetiyapabbata.



[55.]It seems that as the elder was on his way from
Cetiyapabbata to Anurādhapura for alms, a certain daughterinlaw of a
clan, who had quarrelled with her husband and had set out early from
Anurādhapura all dressed up and tricked out like a celestial nymph to go
to her relatives' home, saw him on the road, and being low- minded,
\[21\] she laughed a loud laugh. \[Wondering\] "What is that?" the elder
looked up and finding in the bones of her teeth the perception of
foulness (ugliness), he reached Arahantship.15 Hence it was said:



"He saw the bones that were her teeth,\
And kept in mind his first perception;\
And standing on that very spot\
The elder became an Arahant."



But her husband, who was going after her, saw the elder and asked,
"Venerable



sir, did you by any chance see a woman?" The elder told him:



"Whether it was a man or woman\
That went by I noticed not,



"'*The* *sign of beauty*' here is the aspect of woman that is the cause
for the arising of lust. By the word 'etc.' the sign of resentment
(*paṭigha*), etc., are included, which should be understood as the
undesired aspect that is the cause for the arising of hate. And here
admittedly only covetousness and grief are specified in the text but the
sign of equanimity needs to be included too; since there is
non-restraint in the delusion that arises due to overlooking, or since
'forgetfulness of unknowing' is said below (§57). And here the 'sign of
equanimity' should be understood as an object that is the basis for the
kind of equanimity associated with unknowing through overlooking it. So
'*the sign of beauty*, etc.' given in brief thus is actually the cause
of greed, hate, and delusion. "'*He stops at what is merely seen*':
according to the Sutta method, 'The seen shall be merely seen' (Ud 8).
As soon as the colour basis has been apprehended by the consciousnesses
of the cognitive series with eye-consciousness he stops; he does not
fancy any aspect of beauty, etc., beyond that.... In one who fancies as
beautiful, etc., the limbs of the opposite sex, defilements arisen with
respect to them successively become particularized, which is why they
are called 'particulars.' But these are simply modes of interpreting
(*sannivesākāra*) the kinds of materiality derived from the (four)
primaries that are interpreted (*sanniviṭṭha*) in such and such wise;
for apart from that there is in the ultimate sense no such thing as a
hand and so on" (Vism-mhṭ 40--41). See also Ch. III, note 31.\



15\. "As the elder was going along (occupied) only in keeping his
meditation subject in mind, since noise is a thorn to those in the early
stage, he looked up with the noise of the laughter, (wondering) 'What is
that?' 'Perception of foulness' is perception of bones; for the elder
was then making bones his meditation subject. The elder, it seems as
soon as he saw her teeth-bones while she was laughing, got the
counterpart sign with access jhāna because he had developed the
preliminary-work well. While he stood there he reached the first jhāna.
Then he made that the basis for insight, which he augmented until he
attained the paths one after the other and reached destruction of
cankers" (Vism-mhṭ 41--42).

But only that on this high road\
There goes a group of bones."



[56.]As to the words *through which*, etc., the meaning is: by
reason of which, because of which non-restraint of the eye faculty, *if
he*, if that person, *left the eye faculty unguarded*, remained with the
eye door unclosed by the door-panel of mindfulness, these *states of
covetousness*, etc., *might invade*, might pursue, might threaten, *him.
He enters upon the way of its restraint*: he enters upon the way of
closing that eye faculty by the door-panel of mindfulness. It is the
same one of whom it is said *he guards the eye faculty, undertakes the
restraint of the eye faculty*.



[57.]Herein, there is neither restraint nor non-restraint in
the actual eye faculty, since neither mindfulness nor forgetfulness
arises in dependence on eye-sensitivity. On the contrary when a visible
datum as object comes into the eye's focus, then, after the
life-continuum has arisen twice and ceased, the functional mind-element
accomplishing the function of adverting arises and ceases. After that,
eye- consciousness with the function of seeing; after that, resultant
mind-element with the function of receiving; after that, resultant
root-causeless mind-consciousness- element with the function of
investigating; after that, functional root-causeless
mind-consciousness-element accomplishing the function of determining
arises and ceases. Next to that, impulsion impels.16 Herein, there is
neither restraint nor non- restraint on the occasion of the
life-continuum, or on any of the occasions beginning with adverting. But
there is non-restraint if unvirtuousness or forgetfulness or unknowing
or impatience or idleness arises at the moment of impulsion. When this
happens, it is called "non-restraint in the eye faculty." \[22\]



[58.]Why is that? Because when this happens, the door is not
guarded, nor are the life-continuum and the consciousnesses of the
cognitive series. Like what? Just as, when a city's four gates are not
secured, although inside the city house doors, storehouses, rooms, etc.,
are secured, yet all property inside the city is unguarded and
unprotected since robbers coming in by the city gates can do as they
please, so too, when unvirtuousness, etc., arise in impulsion in which
there is no restraint, then the door too is unguarded, and so also are
the life-continuum and the consciousnesses of the cognitive series
beginning with adverting. But when virtue, etc., has arisen in it, then
the door too is guarded and so also are the life-continuum and the
consciousnesses of



16\. To expect to find in the *Paramatthamañjūsā* an exposition of the
"cognitive series" (*citta-vīthi*), and some explanation of the
individual members in addition to what is to be found in the
*Visuddhimagga* itself, is to be disappointed. There are only
fragmentary treatments. All that is said here is this:\
"There is no unvirtuousness, in other words, bodily or verbal
misconduct, in the five doors; consequently restraint of unvirtuousness
happens through the mind door, and the remaining restraint happens
through the six doors. For the arising of forgetfulness and the other
three would be in the five doors since they are unprofitable states
opposed to mindfulness, etc.; and there is no arising of unvirtuousness
consisting in bodily and verbal transgression there because five-door
impulsions do not give rise to intimation. And the five kinds of
non-restraint beginning with unvirtuousness are stated here as the
opposite of the five kinds of restraint beginning with restraint as
virtue" (Vism-mhṭ 42). See also Ch. IV, note 13.

the cognitive series beginning with adverting. Like what? Just as, when
the city gates are secured, although inside the city the houses, etc.,
are not secured, yet all property inside the city is well guarded, well
protected, since when the city gates are shut there is no ingress for
robbers, so too, when virtue, etc., have arisen in impulsion, the door
too is guarded and so also are the life-continuum and the
consciousnesses of the cognitive series beginning with adverting. Thus
although it actually arises at the moment of impulsion, it is
nevertheless called "restraint in the eye faculty."



[59.]So also as regards the phrases *on hearing a sound with
the ear* and so on. So it is this virtue, which in brief has the
characteristic of avoiding apprehension of signs entailing defilement
with respect to visible objects, etc., that should be understood as
*virtue of restraint of faculties*.



[60.](c) Now, as regards the virtue of livelihood purification
mentioned above next to the virtue of restraint of the faculties (§42),
the words *of the six precepts announced on account of livelihood* mean,
of the following six training precepts announced thus: "With livelihood
as cause, with livelihood as reason, one of evil wishes, a prey to
wishes, lays claim to a higher than human state that is non-existent,
not a fact," the contravention of which is defeat (expulsion from the
Order); "with livelihood as cause, with livelihood as reason, he acts as
go-between," the contravention of which is an offence entailing a
meeting of the Order; "with livelihood as cause, with livelihood as
reason, he says, 'A bhikkhu who lives in your monastery is an Arahant,'"
the contravention of which is a serious offence in one who is aware of
it; "with livelihood as cause, with livelihood as reason, a bhikkhu who
is not sick eats superior food that he has ordered for his own use," the
contravention of which is an offence requiring expiation: "With
livelihood as cause, with livelihood as reason, a bhikkhunī who is not
sick eats superior food that she has ordered for her own use," the
contravention of which is an offence requiring confession; "with
livelihood as cause, with livelihood as reason, one who is not sick eats
curry or boiled rice \[23\] that he has ordered for his own use," the
contravention of which is an offence of wrongdoing (Vin V 146). Of these
six precepts.17



[61.]As regards *scheming*, etc. (§42), this is the text:
"Herein, what is scheming? It is the grimacing, grimacery, scheming,
schemery, schemedness,18 by what is called rejection of requisites or by
indirect talk, or it is the disposing, posing, composing, of the
deportment on the part of one bent on gain, honour and renown, of one of
evil wishes, a prey to wishes---this is called scheming.



[62.]"Herein, what is talking? Talking at others, talking,
talking round, talking up, continual talking up, persuading, continual
persuading, suggesting, continual suggesting, ingratiating chatter,
flattery, bean-soupery, fondling, on the part of one bent on gain,
honour and renown, of one of evil wishes, a prey to wishes---this is
called talking.



17\. This apparently incomplete sentence is also in the Pāḷi text. It is
not clear why. (BPS Ed.)\



18\. The formula "*kuhana kuhāyanā kuhitattaṃ*," i.e. verbal noun in two
forms and abstract noun from pp., all from the same root, is common in
Abhidhamma definitions. It is sometimes hard to produce a corresponding
effect in English, yet to render such groups with words of different
derivation obscures the meaning and confuses the effect.



[]

[63.]"Herein, what is hinting? A sign to others, giving a sign,
indication, giving indication, indirect talk, roundabout talk, on the
part of one bent on gain, honour and renown, of one of evil wishes, a
prey to wishes---this is called hinting.



[64.] "Herein, what is belittling? Abusing of others,
disparaging, reproaching, snubbing, continual snubbing, ridicule,
continual ridicule, denigration, continual denigration, tale-bearing,
backbiting, on the part of one bent on gain, honour and renown, of one
of evil wishes, a prey to wishes---this is called belittling.



[65.]"Herein, what is pursuing gain with gain? Seeking, seeking
for, seeking out, going in search of, searching for, searching out
material goods by means of material goods, such as carrying there goods
that have been got from here, or carrying here goods that have been got
from there, by one bent on gain, honour and renown, by one of evil
wishes, a prey to wishes---this is called pursuing gain with gain."19
(Vibh 352--53)



[66.]The meaning of this text should be understood as follows:
Firstly, as regards description of *scheming*: *on the part of one bent
on gain, honour and renown* is on the part of one who is bent on gain,
on honour, and on reputation; on the part of one who longs for them, is
the meaning. \[24\] *Of one of evil wishes*: of one who wants to show
qualities that he has not got. *A prey to wishes*:20 the meaning is, of
one who is attacked by them. And after this the passage beginning *or by
what is called rejection of requisites* is given in order to show the
three instances of scheming given in the Mahāniddesa as rejection of
requisites, indirect talk, and that based on deportment.



[67.]Herein, \[a bhikkhu\] is invited to accept robes, etc.,
and, precisely because he wants them, he refuses them out of evil
wishes. And then, since he knows that those householders believe in him
implicitly when they think, "Oh, how few are our lord's wishes! He will
not accept a thing!" and they put fine robes, etc., before him by
various means, he then accepts, making a show that he wants to be
compassionate towards them---it is this hypocrisy of his, which becomes
the cause of their subsequently bringing them even by cartloads, that
should be understood as the instance of scheming called rejection of
requisites.



[68.]For this is said in the Mahāniddesa: "What is the instance
of scheming called rejection of requisites? Here householders invite
bhikkhus \[to accept\] robes, alms food, resting place, and the
requisite of medicine as cure for the sick. One who is of evil wishes, a
prey to wishes, wanting robes ... alms food ... resting place ... the
requisite of medicine as cure for the sick, refuses robes ... alms food
... resting place ... the requisite of medicine as cure for the sick,
because he wants more. He says: 'What has an ascetic to do with
expensive robes? It is proper for an ascetic to gather rags from a
charnel ground or from a rubbish heap or from a shop and make them into
a patchwork cloak to wear. What has an ascetic to do with expensive



19\. The renderings "scheming" and so on in this context do not in all
cases agree with PED. They have been chosen after careful consideration.
The rendering "rejection of requisites" takes the preferable reading
*paṭisedhana* though the more common reading here is *paṭisevana*
(cultivation).\
20 The Pali is: "*Icchāpakatassā ti icchāya apakatassa; upaddutassā ti
attho." Icchāya apakatassa* simply resolves the compound
*icchāpakatassa* and is therefore untranslatable into English. Such
resolutions are therefore  sometimes omitted in this translation.

[]



alms food? It is proper for an ascetic to get his living by the dropping
of lumps \[of food into his bowl\] while he wanders for gleanings. What
has an ascetic to do with an expensive resting place? It is proper for
an ascetic to be a tree-root-dweller or an open-air-dweller. What has an
ascetic to do with an expensive requisite of medicine as cure for the
sick? It is proper for an ascetic to cure himself with putrid urine21
and broken gallnuts.' Accordingly he wears a coarse robe, eats coarse
alms food, \[25\] uses a coarse resting place, uses a coarse requisite
of medicine as cure for the sick. Then householders think, 'This ascetic
has few wishes, is content, is secluded, keeps aloof from company, is
strenuous, is a preacher of asceticism,' and they invite him more and
more \[to accept\] robes, alms food, resting places, and the requisite
of medicine as cure for the sick. He says: 'With three things present a
faithful clansman produces much merit: with faith present a faithful
clansman produces much merit, with goods to be given present a faithful
clansman produces much merit, with those worthy to receive present a
faithful clansman produces much merit. You have faith; the goods to be
given are here; and I am here to accept. If I do not accept, then you
will be deprived of the merit. That is no good to me. Rather will I
accept out of compassion for you." Accordingly he accepts many robes, he
accepts much alms food, he accepts many resting places, he accepts many
requisites of medicine as cure for the sick. Such grimacing, grimacery,
scheming, schemery, schemedness, is known as the instance of scheming
called rejection of requisites' (Nidd I 224--25).



[69.]It is hypocrisy on the part of one of evil wishes, who
gives it to be understood verbally in some way or other that he has
attained a higher than human state, that should be understood as the
instance of scheming called indirect talk, according as it is said:
"What is the instance of scheming called indirect talk? Here someone of
evil wishes, a prey to wishes, eager to be admired, \[thinking\] 'Thus
people will admire me' speaks words about the noble state. He says, 'He
who wears such a robe is a very important ascetic.' He says, 'He who
carries such a bowl, metal cup, water filler, water strainer, key, wears
such a waist band, sandals, is a very important ascetic.' He says, 'He
who has such a preceptor ... teacher ... who has the same preceptor, who
has the same teacher, who has such a friend, associate, intimate,
companion; he who lives in such a monastery, lean-to, mansion, villa,22
cave, grotto, hut, pavilion, watch tower, hall, barn, meeting hall,
\[26\] room, at such a tree root, is a very important ascetic.' Or
alternatively, all-gushing, all-grimacing, all-scheming, all-talkative,
with an expression of admiration, he utters such deep, mysterious,
cunning, obscure, supramundane talk suggestive of voidness as 'This
ascetic is an obtainer of peaceful abidings and attainments such as
these.' Such grimacing, grimacery, scheming, schemery, schemedness, is
known as the instance of scheming called indirect talk" (Nidd I
226--27).



[70.]It is hypocrisy on the part of one of evil wishes, which
takes the form of deportment influenced by eagerness to be admired, that
should be understood as the instance of



21 "'*Putrid urine*' is the name for all kinds of cow's urine whether
old or not" (Vism- mhṭ 45). Fermented cow's urine with gallnuts
(myrobalan) is a common Indian medicine today.\
22 It is not always certain now what kind of buildings these names refer
to.

scheming dependent on deportment, according as it is said: "What is the
instance of scheming called deportment? Here someone of evil wishes, a
prey to wishes, eager to be admired, \[thinking\] 'Thus people will
admire me,' composes his way of walking, composes his way of lying down;
he walks studiedly, stands studiedly, sits studiedly, lies down
studiedly; he walks as though concentrated, stands, sits, lies down as
though concentrated; and he is one who meditates in public. Such
disposing, posing, composing, of deportment, grimacing, grimacery,
scheming, schemery, schemedness, is known as the instance of scheming
called deportment" (Nidd I 225--26).



[71.]Herein, the words *by what is called rejection of
requisites* (§61) mean: by what is called thus "rejection of
requisites"; or they mean: by means of the rejection of requisites that
is so called. *By indirect talk* means: by talking near to the subject.
*Of deportment* means: of the four modes of deportment (postures).
*Disposing* is initial posing, or careful posing. *Posing* is the manner
of posing. *Composing* is prearranging; assuming a trust-inspiring
attitude, is what is meant. *Grimacing* is making grimaces by showing
great intenseness; facial contraction is what is meant. One who has the
habit of making grimaces is a grimacer. The grimacer's state is
*grimacery. Scheming* is hypocrisy. The way (*āyanā*) of a schemer
(*kuha*) is *schemery* (*kuhāyanā*). The state of what is schemed is
*schemedness*.



[72.]In the description of *talking*: *talking at* is talking
thus on seeing people coming to the monastery, "What have you come for,
good people? What, to invite bhikkhus? If it is that, then go along and
I shall come later with \[my bowl\]," etc.; or alternatively, *talking
at* is talking by advertising oneself thus, "I am Tissa, the king trusts
me, such and such king's ministers trust me." \[27\] *Talking* is the
same kind of talking on being asked a question. *Talking round* is
roundly talking by one who is afraid of householders' displeasure
because he has given occasion for it. *Talking up* is talking by
extolling people thus, "He is a great land-owner, a great ship-owner, a
great lord of giving." *Continual talking up* is talking by extolling
\[people\] in all ways.



[73.]*Persuading* is progressively involving23 \[people\] thus,
"Lay followers, formerly you used to give first-fruit alms at such a
time; why do you not do so now?" until they say, "We shall give,
venerable sir, we have had no opportunity," etc.; entangling, is what is
meant. Or alternatively, seeing someone with sugarcane in his hand, he
asks, "Where are you coming from, lay follower?"---"From the sugarcane
field, venerable sir"---"Is the sugarcane sweet there?"---"One can find
out by eating, venerable sir"---"It is not allowed, lay follower, for
bhikkhus to say 'Give \[me some\] sugarcane.'" Such entangling talk from
such an entangler is *persuading*. Persuading again and again in all
ways is *continual persuading*.



[74.]*Suggesting* is insinuating by specifying thus, "That
family alone understands me; if there is anything to be given there,
they give it to me only"; pointing to, is what is meant. And here the
story of the oil-seller should be told.24 Suggesting in all ways again
and again is *continual suggesting*.



23\. *Nahanā---*tying, from *nayhati* (to tie). The noun in not in PED.
24\
The story of the oil-seller is given in the *Sammohavinodanī* (Vibh-a
483), which reproduces this part of Vism with some additions: "Two
bhikkhus, it seems, went into a village and sat down in the sitting
hall. Seeing a girl, they called her. Then one asked



[]



[]



[75.]*Ingratiating chatter* is endearing chatter repeated again
and again without regard to whether it is in conformity with truth and
Dhamma. *Flattery* is speaking humbly, always maintaining an attitude of
inferiority. *Bean-soupery* is resemblance to bean soup; for just as
when beans are being cooked only a few do not get cooked, the rest get
cooked, so too the person in whose speech only a little is true, the
rest being false, is called a "bean soup"; his state is *bean-soupery*.



*76. Fondling* is the state of the act of fondling. \[28\] For when a
man fondles children on his lap or on his shoulder like a nurse---he
nurses, is the meaning---that fondler's act is the act of fondling. The
state of the act of fondling is *fondling*.



[77.]In the description of *hinting * (*nemittikatā*):* * a
sign (*nimitta*)* * is any bodily or verbal act that gets others to give
requisites. *Giving a sign* is making a sign such as "What have you got
to eat?", etc., on seeing \[people\] going along with food. *Indication*
is talk that alludes to requisites. *Giving indication*: on seeing
cowboys, he asks, "Are these milk cows' calves or buttermilk cows'
calves?" and when it is said, "They are milk cows' calves, venerable
sir," \[he remarks\] "They are not milk cows' calves. If they were milk
cows' calves the bhikkhus would be getting milk," etc.; and his getting
it to the knowledge of the boys' parents in this way, and so making them
give milk, is *giving indication*.



[78.]*Indirect talk* is talk that keeps near \[to the
subject\]. And here there should be told the story of the bhikkhu
supported by a family. A bhikkhu, it seems, who was supported by a
family went into the house wanting to eat and sat down. The mistress of
the house was unwilling to give. On seeing him she said, "There is no
rice," and she went to a neighbour's house as though to get rice. The
bhikkhu went into the storeroom. Looking round, he saw sugarcane in the
corner behind the door, sugar in a bowl, a string of salt fish in a
basket, rice in a jar, and ghee in a pot. He came out and sat down. When
the housewife came back, she said, "I did not get any rice." The bhikkhu
said, "Lay follower, I saw a sign just now that alms will not be easy to
get today."---"What, venerable sir?"--- "I saw a snake that was like
sugarcane put in the corner behind the door; looking for something to
hit it with, I saw a stone like a lump of sugar in a bowl. When the
snake had been hit with the clod, it spread out a hood like a string of
salt fish in a basket, and its teeth as it tried to bite the clod were
like rice grains in a jar. Then the saliva mixed with poison that came
out to its mouth in its fury was like ghee put in a pot." She thought,
"There is no hoodwinking the shaveling," so she gave him the sugarcane
\[29\] and she cooked the rice and gave it all to him with the ghee, the
sugar and the fish.



[79.]Such talk that keeps near \[to the subject\] should be
understood as indirect talk. *Roundabout talk* is talking round and
round \[the subject\] as much as is allowed.



[80.]In the description of *belittling: abusing* is abusing by
means of the ten instances of abuse.25 *Disparaging* is contemptuous
talk. *Reproaching* is enumeration of faults such as "He is faithless,
he is an unbeliever." *Snubbing* is taking up verbally thus,



the other, 'Whose girl is this, venerable sir?'---'She is the daughter
of our supporter the oil- seller, friend. When we go to her mother's
house and she gives us ghee, she gives it in the pot. And this girl too
gives it in the pot as her mother does.'" Quoted at Vism-mhṭ 46.



25\. The "ten instances of abuse" (*akkosa-vatthu*) are given in the
*Sammohavinodanī* (Vibh- a 340) as: "You are a thief, you are a fool,
you are an idiot, you are a camel (*oṭṭha*),



[]



[]



"Don't say that here." Snubbing in all ways, giving grounds and reasons,
is *continual snubbing*. Or alternatively, when someone does not give,
taking him up thus, "Oh, the prince of givers!" is *snubbing*; and the
thorough snubbing thus, "A mighty prince of givers!" is *continual
snubbing*. *Ridicule* is making fun of someone thus, "What sort of a
life has this man who eats up his seed \[grain\]?" *Continual ridicule*
is making fun of him more thoroughly thus, "What, you say this man is
not a giver who always gives the words 'There is nothing' to everyone?"



[81.]*Denigration26 is denigrating someone by saying that he is
not a giver, or by censuring him. All-round denigration is continual
denigration. Tale-bearing* is bearing tales from house to house, from
village to village, from district to district, \[thinking\] "So they
will give to me out of fear of my bearing tales." *Backbiting* is
speaking censoriously behind another's back after speaking kindly to his
face; for this is like biting the flesh of another's back, when he is
not looking, on the part of one who is unable to look him in the face;
therefore it is called *backbiting*. This is called *belittling*
(*nippesikatā*) because it scrapes off (*nippeseti*), wipes off, the
virtuous qualities of others as a bamboo scraper (*veḷupesikā*) does
unguent, or because it is a pursuit of gain by grinding (*nippiṃsitvā*)
and pulverizing others' virtuous qualities, like the pursuit of perfume
by grinding perfumed substances; that is why it is called *belittling*.



[82.]\`In the description of *pursuing gain with gain*:
*pursuing* is hunting after. *Got from here* is got from this house.
*There* is into that house. *Seeking* is wanting. *Seeking for* is
hunting after. *Seeking out* is hunting after again and again. \[30\]
The story of the bhikkhu who went round giving away the alms he had got
at first to children of families here and there and in the end got milk
and gruel should be told here. *Searching*, etc., are synonyms for
"seeking," etc., and so the construction here should be understood thus:
*going in search of* is seeking; *searching for* is seeking for;
*searching out* is seeking out.



This is the meaning of *scheming,* and so on.



[83.]Now, \[as regards the words\] *The evil states beginning
with* (§42): here the words *beginning with* should be understood to
include the many evil states given in the Brahmajāla Sutta in the way
beginning, "Or just as some worthy ascetics, while eating the food given
by the faithful, make a living by wrong livelihood, by such low arts as
these, that is to say, by palmistry, by fortune-telling, by divining
omens, by interpreting dreams, marks on the body, holes gnawed by mice;
by fire sacrifice, by spoon oblation ..." (D I 9).



you are an ox, you are a donkey, you belong to the states of loss, you
belong  to hell, you are a beast, there is not even a happy or an
unhappy destiny to be expected for you" (see also Sn-a 364).\



26\. The following words of this paragraph are not in PED: *Pāpanā*
(denigration), *pāpanaṃ* (nt. denigrating), *nippeseti* (scrapes
off---from *piṃsati*? cf. *nippesikatā---* "belittling" §§42, 64),
*nippuñchati* (wipes off---only *puñchati* in PED), *pesikā*
(scraper---not in this sense in PED: from same root as *nippeseti*),
*nippiṃsitvā* (grinding, pounding), *abbhaṅga* (unguent = *abbhañjana*,
Vism-mhṭ 47).

[]



[84.]So this wrong livelihood entails the transgression of
these six training precepts announced on account of livelihood, and it
entails the evil states beginning with "Scheming, talking, hinting,
belittling, pursuing gain with gain." And so it is the abstinence from
all sorts of wrong livelihood that is *virtue of livelihood
purification*, the word-meaning of which is this: on account of it they
live, thus it is livelihood. What is that? It is the effort consisting
in the search for requisites. "Purification" is purifiedness.
"Livelihood purification" is purification of livelihood.



[85.](d) As regards the next kind called *virtue concerning
requisites*, \[here is the text: "Reflecting wisely, he uses the robe
only for protection from cold, for protection from heat, for protection
from contact with gadflies, flies, wind, burning and creeping things,
and only for the purpose of concealing the private parts. Reflecting
wisely, he uses alms food neither for amusement nor for intoxication nor
for smartening nor for embellishment, but only for the endurance and
continuance of this body, for the ending of discomfort, and for
assisting the life of purity: 'Thus I shall put a stop to old feelings
and shall not arouse new feelings, and I shall be healthy and blameless
and live in comfort.' Reflecting wisely, he uses the resting place only
for the purpose of protection from cold, for protection from heat, for
protection from contact with gadflies, flies, wind, burning and creeping
things, and only for the purpose of warding off the perils of climate
and enjoying retreat. Reflecting wisely, he uses the requisite of
medicine as cure for the sick only for protection from arisen hurtful
feelings and for complete immunity from affliction" (M I 10). Herein,
*reflecting wisely* is reflecting as the means and as the way;27 by
knowing, by reviewing, is the meaning. And here it is the reviewing
stated in the way beginning, "For protection from cold" that should be
understood as "reflecting wisely."



[86.] Herein, *the robe* is any one of those beginning with the
inner cloth. *He uses*: he employs; dresses in \[as inner cloth\], or
puts on \[as upper garment\]. *Only* \[31\] is a phrase signifying
invariability in the definition of a limit28 of a purpose; the purpose
in the meditator's making use of the robes is that much only, namely,
protection from cold, etc., not more than that. *From cold*: from any
kind of cold arisen either through disturbance of elements internally or
through change in temperature externally.  *For protection*: for the
purpose of warding off; for the purpose of eliminating it so that it may
not arouse affliction in the body. For when the body is afflicted by
cold, the distracted mind cannot be wisely exerted. That is why the
Blessed One permitted the robe to be used for protection from cold. So
in each instance, except that *from heat* means from the heat of fire,
the origin of which should be understood as forest fires, and so on.



[87.]*From contact with gadflies and flies, wind and burning
and creeping things*: here *gadflies* are flies that bite; they are also
called "blind flies." *Flies* are just flies. *Wind* is distinguished as
that with dust and that without dust. *Burning* is burning of the sun.
*Creeping things* are any long creatures such as snakes and so on that
move by crawling. Contact with them is of two kinds: contact by being
bitten and contact



27\. For attention (*manasi-kāra*) as the means (*upāya*) and the way
(*patha*) see M-a I 64.



28\. *Avadhi---*"limit" = *odhi*: this form is not in PED (see M-a II
292).

by being touched. And that does not worry him who sits with a robe on.
So he uses it for the purpose of protection from such things.



[88.]*Only*: the word is repeated in order to define a
subdivision of the invariable purpose; for the concealment of the
private parts is an invariable purpose; the others are purposes
periodically. Herein, *private parts* are any parts of the pudendum. For
when a member is disclosed, conscience (*hiri*) is disturbed
(*kuppati*), offended. It is called "private parts" (*hirikopīna*)
because of the disturbance of conscience (*hiri-kopana*). *For the
purpose of concealing the private parts:* for the purpose of the
concealment of those private parts. \[As well as the reading
"*hiriko-pīna-paṭicchādanatthaṃ*\] there is a reading "*hirikopīnaṃ
paṭicchādanatthaṃ*."



[89.]*Alms food* is any sort of food. For any sort of nutriment
is called "alms food" (*piṇḍapāta---*lit. "lump-dropping") because of
its having been dropped (*patitattā*) into a bhikkhu's bowl during his
alms round (*piṇḍolya*). Or alms food (*piṇḍapāta*) is the dropping
(*pāta*) of the lumps (*piṇḍa*); it is the concurrence (*sannipāta*),
the collection, of alms (*bhikkhā*) obtained here and there, is what is
meant.



*Neither for amusement*: neither for the purpose of amusement, as with
village boys, etc.; for the sake of sport, is what is meant. *Nor for
intoxication*: not for the purpose of intoxication, as with boxers,
etc.; for the sake of intoxication with strength and for the sake of
intoxication with manhood, is what is meant. \[32\] *Nor for
smartening*: not for the purpose of smartening, as with royal
concubines, courtesans, etc.; for the sake of plumpness in all the
limbs, is what is meant. *Nor for embellishment*: not for the purpose of
embellishment, as with actors, dancers, etc.; for the sake of a clear
skin and complexion, is what is meant.



[90.] And here the clause *neither for amusement* is stated for
the purpose of abandoning support for delusion; *nor for intoxication*
is said for the purpose of abandoning support for hate; *nor for
smartening nor for embellishment* is said for the purpose of abandoning
support for greed. And *neither for amusement nor for intoxication* is
said for the purpose of preventing the arising of fetters for oneself.
*Nor for smartening nor for embellishment* is said for the purpose of
preventing the arising of fetters for another. And the abandoning of
both unwise practice and devotion to indulgence of sense pleasures
should be understood as stated by these four. *Only* has the meaning
already stated.



[91.]*Of this body*: of this material body consisting of the
four great primaries. *For the endurance*: for the purpose of continued
endurance. *And continuance*: for the purpose of not interrupting
\[life's continued\] occurrence, or for the purpose of endurance for a
long time. He makes use of the alms food for the purpose of the
endurance, for the purpose of the continuance, of the body, as the owner
of an old house uses props for his house, and as a carter uses axle
grease, not for the purpose of amusement, intoxication, smartening, and
embellishment. Furthermore, endurance is a term for the life faculty. So
what has been said as far as the words *for the endurance and
continuance of this body* can be understood to mean: for the purpose of
maintaining the occurrence of the life faculty in this body.



[92.] *For the ending of discomfort*: hunger is called
"discomfort" in the sense of



afflicting. He makes use of alms food for the purpose of ending that,
like anointing



[]



[]



a wound, like counteracting heat with cold, and so on. *For assisting
the life of purity*: for the purpose of assisting the life of purity
consisting in the whole dispensation and the life of purity consisting
in the path. For while this \[bhikkhu\] is engaged in crossing the
desert of existence by means of devotion to the three trainings
depending on bodily strength whose necessary condition is the use of
alms food, he makes use of it to assist the life of purity just as those
seeking to cross the desert used their child's flesh,29 just as those
seeking to cross a river use a raft, and just as those seeking to cross
the ocean use a ship.



[93.]*Thus I shall put a stop to old feelings and shall not
arouse new feelings*: \[33\] thus as a sick man uses medicine, he uses
\[alms food, thinking\]: "By use of this alms food I shall put a stop to
the old feeling of hunger, and I shall not arouse a new feeling by
immoderate eating, like one of the \[proverbial\] brahmans, that is, one
who eats till he has to be helped up by hand, or till his clothes will
not meet, or till he rolls there \[on the ground\], or till crows can
peck from his mouth, or until he vomits what he has eaten. Or
alternatively, there is that which is called 'old feelings' because,
being conditioned by former kamma, it arises now in dependence on
unsuitable immoderate eating---I shall put a stop to that old feeling,
forestalling its condition by suitable moderate eating. And there is
that which is called 'new feeling' because it will arise in the future
in dependence on the accumulation of kamma consisting in making improper
use \[of the requisite of alms food\] now---I shall also not arouse that
new feeling, avoiding by means of proper use the production of its
root." This is how the meaning should be understood here. What has been
shown so far can be understood to include proper use \[of requisites\],
abandoning of devotion to self-mortification, and not giving up lawful
bliss (pleasure).



[94.]*And I shall be healthy*: "In this body, which exists in
dependence on requisites, I shall, by moderate eating, have health
called 'long endurance' since there will be no danger of severing the
life faculty or interrupting the \[continuity of the\] postures."
\[Reflecting\] in this way, he makes use \[of the alms food\] as a
sufferer from a chronic disease does of his medicine. *And blameless and
live in comfort* (lit. "and have blamelessness and a comfortable
abiding"): he makes use of them thinking: "I shall have blamelessness by
avoiding improper search, acceptance and eating, and I shall have a
comfortable abiding by moderate eating." Or he does so thinking: "I
shall have blamelessness due to absence of such faults as boredom,
sloth, sleepiness, blame by the wise, etc., that have unseemly
immoderate eating as their condition; and I shall have a comfortable
abiding by producing bodily strength that has seemly moderate eating as
its condition." Or he does so thinking: "I shall have blamelessness by
abandoning the pleasure of lying down, lolling and torpor, through
refraining from eating as much as possible to stuff the belly; and I
shall have a comfortable abiding by controlling the four postures
through eating four or five mouthfuls less than the maximum." For this
is said:



29\. "*Child's flesh*" (*putta-maṃsa*) is an allusion to the story (S II
98) of the couple who set out to cross a desert with an insufficient
food supply but got to the other side by eating the flesh of their child
who died on the way. The derivation given in PED, "A metaphor probably
distorted from *pūtamaṃsa*," has no justification. The reference to
rafts might be to D II 89.

[]



With four or five lumps still to eat\
Let him then end by drinking water;\
For energetic bhikkhus' needs\
This should suffice to live in comfort (Th 983). \[34\]



Now, what has been shown at this point can be understood as discernment
of



purpose and practice of the middle way.



[95.]*Resting place* (*senāsana*): this is the bed (*sena*) and
seat (*āsana*). For wherever one sleeps (*seti*), whether in a monastery
or in a lean-to, etc., that is the bed (*sena*); wherever one seats
oneself (*āsati*), sits *(nisīdati*), that is the seat (*āsana*). Both
together are called "resting-place" (or "abode"---*senāsana*).



*For the purpose of warding off the perils of climate and enjoying
retreat*: the climate itself in the sense of imperilling (*parisahana*)
is "perils of climate" (*utu-parissaya*). Unsuitable climatic conditions
that cause mental distraction due to bodily affliction can be warded off
by making use of the resting place; it is for the purpose of warding off
these and for the purpose of the pleasure of solitude, is what is meant.
Of course, the warding off of the perils of climate is stated by \[the
phrase\] "protection from cold," etc., too; but, just as in the case of
making use of the robes the concealment of the private parts is stated
as an invariable purpose while the others are periodical \[purposes\],
so here also this \[last\] should be understood as mentioned with
reference to the invariable warding off of the perils of climate. Or
alternatively, this "climate" of the kind stated is just climate; but
"perils" are of two kinds: evident perils and concealed perils (see Nidd
I 12). Herein, evident perils are lions, tigers, etc., while concealed
perils are greed, hate, and so on. When a bhikkhu knows and reflects
thus in making use of the kind of resting place where these \[perils\]
do not, owing to unguarded doors and sight of unsuitable visible
objects, etc., cause affliction, he can be understood as one who
"reflecting wisely makes use of the resting place for the purpose of
warding off the perils of climate."



[96.]*The requisite of medicine as cure for the sick*: here
"cure" (*paccaya =* going against) is in the sense of going against
(*pati-ayana*) illness; in the sense of countering, is the meaning. This
is a term for any suitable remedy. It is the medical man's work
(*bhisakkassa kammaṃ*) because it is permitted by him, thus it is
medicine (*bhesajja*). Or the cure for the sick itself as medicine is
"medicine as cure for the sick." Any work of a medical man such as oil,
honey, ghee, etc., that is suitable for one who is sick, is what is
meant. A "requisite" (*parikkhāra*), however, in such passages as "It is
well supplied with the requisites of a city" (A IV 106) is equipment; in
such passages as "The chariot has the requisite of virtue, the axle of
jhāna, the wheel of energy" (S V 6) \[35\] it is an ornament; in such
passages as "The requisites for the life of one who has gone into
homelessness that should be available" (M I 104), it is an accessory.
But here both equipment and accessory are applicable. For that medicine
as a cure for the sick is equipment for maintaining life because it
protects by preventing the arising of affliction destructive to life;
and it is an accessory too because it is an instrument for prolonging
life. That is why it is called "requisite." So it is medicine as cure
for the sick and that is a requisite, thus it is a "requisite of
medicine as cure for the sick." \[He makes use of\] that requisite of
medicine as cure



[]



[]



for the sick; any requisite for life consisting of oil, honey, molasses,
ghee, etc., that is allowed by a medical man as suitable for the sick,
is what is meant.



[97.]*From arisen*: from born, become, produced. *Hurtful*:
here "hurt (affliction)" is a disturbance of elements, and it is the
leprosy, tumours, boils, etc., originated by that disturbance. *Hurtful*
(*veyyābādhika*) because arisen in the form of hurt (*byābādha*).
*Feelings*: painful feelings, feelings resulting from unprofitable
kamma---from those hurtful feelings. *For complete immunity from
affliction*: for complete freedom from pain; so that all that is painful
is abandoned, is the meaning.



This is how this *virtue concerning requisites* should be understood. In
brief its characteristic is the use of requisites after wise reflection.
The word-meaning here is this: because breathing things go (*ayanti*),
move, proceed, using \[what they use\] in dependence on these robes,
etc., these robes, etc., are therefore called requisites (*paccaya =*
ger. of *paṭi + ayati*); "concerning requisites" is concerning those
requisites.



[98.](a) So, in this fourfold virtue, *Pātimokkha restraint*
has to be undertaken by means of faith. For that is accomplished by
faith, since the announcing of training precepts is outside the
disciples' province; and the evidence here is the refusal of the request
to \[allow disciples to\] announce training precepts (see Vin III
9--10). Having therefore undertaken through faith the training precepts
without exception as announced, one should completely perfect them
without regard for life. For this is said: \[36\]



"As a hen guards her eggs,\
Or as a yak her tail,\
Or like a darling child,\
Or like an only eye---\
So you who are engaged\
Your virtue to protect,\
Be prudent at all times\
And ever scrupulous." (*Source untraced*)



Also it is said further: "So too, sire, when a training precept for
disciples is announced by me, my disciples do not transgress it even for
the sake of life" (A IV 201).



[99.]And the story of the elders bound by robbers in the forest
should be understood in this sense.



It seems that robbers in the Mahāvaṭṭanī Forest bound an elder with
black creepers and made him lie down. While he lay there for seven days
he augmented his insight, and after reaching the fruition of non-return,
he died there and was reborn in the Brahmā-world. Also they bound
another elder in Tambapaṇṇi Island (Sri Lanka) with string creepers and
made him lie down. When a forest fire came and the creepers were not
cut, he established insight and attained Nibbāna simultaneously with his
death. When the Elder Abhaya, a preacher of the Dīgha Nikāya, passed by
with five hundred bhikkhus, he saw \[what had happened\] and he had the
elder's body cremated and a shrine built. Therefore let other clansmen
also:



Maintain the rules of conduct pure,\
Renouncing life if there be need,



[]



[]



Rather than break virtue's restraint\
By the World's Saviour decreed.



[100.](b) And as Pātimokkha restraint is undertaken out of
faith, so *restraint of the sense faculties* should be undertaken with
*mindfulness*. For that is accomplished by mindfulness, because when the
sense faculties' functions are founded on mindfulness, there is no
liability to invasion by covetousness and the rest. So, recollecting the
Fire Discourse, which begins thus, "Better, bhikkhus, the extirpation of
the eye faculty by a red-hot burning blazing glowing iron spike than the
apprehension of signs in the particulars of visible objects cognizable
by the eye" (S IV 168), this \[restraint\] should be properly undertaken
by preventing with unremitting mindfulness any apprehension, in the
objective fields consisting of visible data, etc., of any signs, etc.,
likely to encourage covetousness, etc., to invade consciousness
occurring in connection with the eye door, and so on.



[101.] \[37\] When not undertaken thus, virtue of Pātimokkha
restraint is unenduring: it does not last, like a crop not fenced in
with branches. And it is raided by the robber defilements as a village
with open gates is by thieves. And lust leaks into his mind as rain does
into a badly-roofed house. For this is said:



"Among the visible objects, sounds, and smells,\
And tastes, and tangibles, guard the faculties;\
For when these doors are open and unguarded,\
Then thieves will come and raid as 'twere a village (?).



And just as with an ill-roofed house\
The rain comes leaking in, so too\
Will lust come leaking in for sure\
Upon an undeveloped mind" (Dhp 13).



[102.] When it is undertaken thus, virtue of Pātimokkha
restraint is enduring: it lasts, like a crop well fenced in with
branches. And it is not raided by the robber defilements, as a village
with well-guarded gates is not by thieves. And lust does not leak into
his mind, as rain does not into a well-roofed house. For this is said:



"Among the visible objects, sounds and smells,\
And tastes and tangibles, guard the faculties;\
For when these doors are closed and truly guarded,\
Thieves will not come and raid as 'twere a village (?).



"And just as with a well-roofed house\
No rain comes leaking in, so too\
No lust comes leaking in for sure\
Upon a well-developed mind" (Dhp 14).



[103.] This, however, is the teaching at its very highest.



This mind is called "quickly transformed" (A I 10), so restraint of the
faculties should be undertaken by removing arisen lust with the
contemplation of foulness, as was done by the Elder Vaṅgīsa soon after
he had gone forth. \[38\]



As the elder was wandering for alms, it seems, soon after going forth,
lust arose



in him on seeing a woman. Thereupon he said to the venerable Ānanda:



[]



[]



"I am afire with sensual lust.\
And burning flames consume my mind;\
In pity tell me, Gotama,\
How to extinguish it for good" (S I 188).



The elder said:



"You do perceive mistakenly,\
That burning flames consume your mind.\
Look for no sign of beauty there,\
For that it is which leads to lust.\
See foulness there and keep your mind\
Harmoniously concentrated;\
Formations see as alien,\
As ill, not self, so this great lust\
May be extinguished, and no more\
Take fire thus ever and again" (S I 188).



The elder expelled his lust and then went on with his alms round.



[104.]Moreover, a bhikkhu who is fulfilling restraint of the
faculties should be like the Elder Cittagutta resident in the Great Cave
at Kuraṇḍaka, and like the Elder Mahā Mitta resident at the Great
Monastery of Coraka.



[105.]In the Great Cave of Kuraṇḍaka, it seems, there was a
lovely painting of the Renunciation of the Seven Buddhas. A number of
bhikkhus wandering about among the dwellings saw the painting and said,
"What a lovely painting, venerable sir!" The elder said: "For more than
sixty years, friends, I have lived in the cave, and I did not know
whether there was any painting there or not. Now, today, I know it
through those who have eyes." The elder, it seems, though he had lived
there for so long, had never raised his eyes and looked up at the cave.
And at the door of his cave there was a great ironwood tree. And the
elder had never looked up at that either. He knew it was in flower when
he saw its petals on the ground each year.



[106.] The king heard of the elder's great virtues, and he sent
for him three times, desiring to pay homage to him. When the elder did
not go, he had the breasts of all the women with infants in the town
bound and sealed off, \[saying\] "As long as the elder does not come let
the children go without milk," \[39\] Out of compassion for the children
the elder went to Mahāgāma. When the king heard \[that he had come, he
said\] "Go and bring the elder in. I shall take the precepts." Having
had him brought up into the inner palace, he paid homage to him and
provided him with a meal. Then, saying, "Today, venerable sir, there is
no opportunity. I shall take the precepts tomorrow," he took the elder's
bowl. After following him for a little, he paid homage with the queen
and turned back. As seven days went by thus, whether it was the king who
paid homage or whether it was the queen, the elder said, "May the king
be happy."



[107.] Bhikkhus asked: "Why is it, venerable sir, that whether
it is the king who pays the homage or the queen you say 'May the king be
happy'?" The elder replied: "Friends, I do not notice whether it is the
king or the queen." At the end of seven days \[when it was found that\]
the elder was not happy living there, he was dismissed



[]



[]



by the king. He went back to the Great Cave at Kuraṇḍaka. When it was
night he went out onto his walk. A deity who dwelt in the ironwood tree
stood by with a torch of sticks. Then his meditation subject became
quite clear and plain. The elder, \[thinking\] "How clear my meditation
subject is today!" was glad, and immediately after the middle watch he
reached Arahantship, making the whole rock resound.30



[108.] So when another clansman seeks his own good:



Let him not be hungry-eyed,\
Like a monkey in the groves,\
Like a wild deer in the woods,\
Like a nervous little child.\
Let him go with eyes downcast\
Seeing a plough yoke's length before,\
That he fall not in the power\
Of the forest-monkey mind.



[109.] The Elder Mahā Mitta's mother was sick with a poisoned
tumour. She told her daughter, who as a bhikkhunī had also gone forth,
"Lady, go to your brother. Tell him my trouble and bring back some
medicine." She went and told him. The elder said: "I do not know how to
gather root medicines and such things and concoct a medicine from them.
But rather I will tell you a medicine: since I went forth I have not
broken \[my virtue of restraint of\] the sense faculties by looking at
the bodily form of the opposite sex with a lustful mind. By this \[40\]
declaration of truth may my mother get well. Go and tell the lay devotee
and rub her body." She went and told her what had happened and then did
as she had been instructed. At that very moment the lay devotee's tumour
vanished, shrinking away like a lump of froth. She got up and uttered a
cry of joy: "If the Fully Enlightened One were still alive, why should
he not stroke with his netadorned hand the head of a bhikkhu like my
son?" So:



[110.] Let another noble clansman\
Gone forth in the Dispensation\
Keep, as did the Elder Mitta,\
Perfect faculty restraint.



[111.](c) As restraint of the faculties is to be undertaken by
means of mindfulness, so *livelihood purification* is to be undertaken
by means of *energy*. For that is accomplished by energy, because the
abandoning of wrong livelihood is effected in one who has rightly
applied energy. Abandoning, therefore, unbefitting wrong search, this
should be undertaken with energy by means of the right kind of search
consisting in going on alms round, etc., avoiding what is of impure
origin as though it were a poisonous snake, and using only requisites of
pure origin.



[112.]Herein, for one who has not taken up the ascetic
practices, any requisites obtained from the Community, from a group of
bhikkhus, or from laymen who have confidence in his special qualities of
teaching the Dhamma, etc., are called "of pure origin." But



30\. "'*Making the whole rock resound*': 'making the whole rock
reverberate as one doing so by means of an earth tremor. But some say
that is was owing to the cheering of the deities who lived there'"
(Vism-mhṭ 58).



[]



[]



those obtained on alms round, etc., are of extremely pure origin. For
one who has taken up the ascetic practices, those obtained on alms
round, etc., and---as long as this is in accordance with the rules of
the ascetic practices---from people who have confidence in his special
qualities of asceticism, are called "of pure origin." And if he has got
putrid urine with mixed gall nuts and "four-sweets"31 for the purpose of
curing a certain affliction, and he eats only the broken gall nuts,
thinking, "Other companions in the life of purity will eat the
'four-sweets'," his undertaking of the ascetic practices is befitting,
for he is then called a bhikkhu who is supreme in the Noble Ones'
heritages (A II 28).



[113.] As to the robe and the other requisites, no hint,
indication, roundabout talk, or intimation about robes and alms food is
allowable for a bhikkhu who is purifying his livelihood. But a hint,
indication, or roundabout talk about a resting place is allowable for
one who has not taken up the ascetic practices. \[41\]



[114.] Herein, a "hint" is when one who is getting the
preparing of the ground, etc., done for the purpose of \[making\] a
resting place is asked, "What is being done, venerable sir? Who is
having it done?" and he replies, "No one"; or any other such giving of
hints. An "indication" is saying, "Lay follower, where do you
live?"---"In a mansion, venerable sir"---"But, lay follower, a mansion
is not allowed for bhikkhus." Or any other such giving of indication.
"Roundabout talk" is saying, "The resting place for the Community of
Bhikkhus is crowded"; or any other such oblique talk.



[115.] All, however, is allowed in the case of medicine. But
when the disease is cured, is it or is it not allowed to use the
medicine obtained in this way? Herein, the Vinaya specialists say that
the opening has been given by the Blessed One, therefore it is
allowable. But the Suttanta specialists say that though there is no
offence, nevertheless the livelihood is sullied, therefore it is not
allowable.



[116.] But one who does not use hints, indications, roundabout
talk, or intimation, though these are permitted by the Blessed One, and
who depends only on the special qualities of fewness of wishes, etc.,
and makes use only of requisites obtained otherwise than by indication,
etc., even when he thus risks his life, is called supreme in living in
effacement, like the venerable Sāriputta.



[117.] It seems that the venerable one was cultivating
seclusion at one time, living in a certain forest with the Elder Mahā
Moggallāna. One day an affliction of colic arose in him, causing him
great pain. In the evening the Elder Mahā Moggallāna went to attend upon
him. Seeing him lying down, he asked what the reason was. And then he
asked, "What used to make you better formerly, friend?" The elder said,
"When I was a layman, friend, my mother used to mix ghee, honey, sugar
and so on, and give me rice gruel with pure milk. That used to make me
better." Then the other said, "So be it, friend. If either you or I have
merit, perhaps tomorrow we shall get some."



[118.] Now, a deity who dwelt in a tree at the end of the walk
overheard their



conversation. \[Thinking\] "I will find rice gruel for the lord
tomorrow," he went



31\. "Four-sweets"---*catumadhura*: a medicinal sweet made of four
ingredients: honey, palm-sugar, ghee and sesame oil.



[]



[]



meanwhile to the family who was supporting the elder \[42\] and entered
into the body of the eldest son, causing him discomfort. Then he told
the assembled relatives the price of the cure: "If you prepare rice
gruel of such a kind tomorrow for the elder, I will set this one free."
They said: "Even without being told by you we regularly supply the
elder's needs," and on the following day they prepared rice gruel of the
kind needed.



[119.]The Elder Mahā Moggallāna came in the morning and said,
"Stay here, friend, till I come back from the alms round." Then he went
into the village. Those people met him. They took his bowl, filled it
with the stipulated kind of rice gruel, and gave it back to him. The
elder made as though to go, but they said, "Eat, venerable sir, we shall
give you more." When the elder had eaten, they gave him another bowlful.
The elder left. Bringing the alms food to the venerable Sāriputta, he
said, "Here, friend Sāriputta, eat." When the elder saw it, he thought,
"The gruel is very nice. How was it got?" and seeing how it had been
obtained, he said, "Friend, the alms food cannot be used."



[120.] Instead of thinking, "He does not eat alms food brought
by the likes of me," the other at once took the bowl by the rim and
turned it over on one side. As the rice gruel fell on the ground the
elder's affliction vanished. From then on it did not appear again during
forty-five years.



[121.]Then he said to the venerable Mahā Moggallāna, "Friend,
even if one's bowels come out and trail on the ground, it is not fitting
to eat gruel got by verbal intimation," and he uttered this exclamation:



My livelihood might well be blamed\
If I were to consent to eat\
The honey and the gruel obtained\
By influence of verbal hints.



And even if my bowels obtrude\
And trail outside, and even though\
My life is to be jeopardized,\
I will not blot my livelihood (Mil 370).



For I will satisfy my heart\
By shunning all wrong kinds of search;\
And never will I undertake\
The search the Buddhas have condemned. \[43\]



122 And here too should be told the story of the Elder Mahā Tissa the
Mango- eater who lived at Cīragumba32 (see §132 below). So in all
respects:



32\. "The Elder Mahā Tissa, it seems, was going on a journey during a
famine, and being tired in body and weak through lack of food and travel
weariness, he lay down at the root of a mango tree covered with fruit.
There were many fallen mangoes here and there" (Vism-mhṭ 60). "Through
ownerless mangoes were lying fallen on the ground near him, he would not
eat them in the absence of someone to accept them from" (Vism- mhṭ 65).
"Then a lay devotee, who was older than he, went to the elder, and
learning of his exhaustion, gave him mango juice to drink. Then he
mounted him on his back and



[]



[]



A man who has gone forth in faith\
Should purify his livelihood\
And, seeing clearly, give no thought\
To any search that is not good.



[123.] (d) And as livelihood purification is to be undertaken
by means of energy, so *virtue dependent on requisites* is to be
undertaken by means of *understanding*. For that is accomplished by
understanding, because one who possesses understanding is able to see
the advantages and the dangers in requisites. So one should abandon
greed for requisites and undertake that virtue by using requisites
obtained lawfully and properly, after reviewing them with understanding
in the way aforesaid.



[124.] Herein, reviewing is of two kinds: at the time of
receiving requisites and at the time of using them. For use
(*paribhoga*) is blameless in one who at the time of receiving robes,
etc., reviews them either as \[mere\] elements or as repulsive,33 and
puts them aside for later use, and in one who reviews them thus at the
time of using them.



[125.] Here is an explanation to settle the matter. There are
four kinds of use: use as theft,34 use as a debt?, use as an
inheritance, use as a master. Herein, use by one who is unvirtuous and
makes use \[of requisites\], even sitting in the midst of the Community,
is called "use as theft." Use without reviewing by one who is virtuous
is "use as a debt"; therefore the robe should be reviewed every time it
is used, and the alms food lump by lump. One who cannot do this \[should
review it\] before the meal, after the meal, in the first watch, in the
middle watch, and in the last watch. If dawn breaks on him without his
having reviewed it, he finds himself in the position of one who has used
it as a debt. Also the resting place should be reviewed each time it is
used. Recourse to mindfulness both in the accepting and the use of
medicine is proper; but while this is so, though there is an offence for
one who uses it without mindfulness after mindful acceptance, there is
no offence for one who is mindful in using after accepting without
mindfulness.



[126.] Purification is of four kinds: purification by the
Teaching, purification by



restraint, purification by search, and purification by reviewing.
Herein, *virtue of*



took him to his home. Meanwhile the elder admonished himself as follows:
'Nor your mother nor your father,' etc. (see §133). And beginning the
comprehension \[of formations\], and augmenting insight, he realized
Arahantship after the other paths in due succession while he was still
mounted on his back" (Vism-mhṭ 60).



33\. "'*As elements*' in this way: 'This robe, etc., consists merely of
\[the four\] elements and occurs when its conditions are present; and
the person who uses it \[likewise\].' '*As repulsive*' in this way:
Firstly perception of repulsiveness in nutriment in the case of alms
food; then as bringing repulsiveness to mind thus: 'But all these robes,
etc., which are not in themselves disgusting, become utterly disgusting
on reaching this filthy body'" (Vism-mhṭ 61).\



34\. "'*Use as theft*': use by one who is unworthy. And the requisites
are allowed by the Blessed One to one in his own dispensation who is
virtuous, not unvirtuous; and the generosity of the givers is towards
one who is virtuous, not towards one who is not, since they expect great
fruit from their actions" (Vism-mhṭ 61; cf. MN 142 and commentary).



[]



[]



*the Pātimokkha restraint* is called "purification by the Teaching";
\[44\] for that is so called because it purifies by means of teaching.
*Virtue of restraint of faculties* is called "purification by
restraint"; for that is so called because it purifies by means of the
restraint in the mental resolution, "I shall not do so again." *Virtue
of livelihood purification* is called "purification by search"; for that
is so called because search is purified in one who abandons wrong search
and gets requisites lawfully and properly. *Virtue dependent on
requisites* is called "purification by reviewing"; for that is so called
because it purifies by the reviewing of the kind already described.
Hence it was said above (§125): "There is no offence for one who is
mindful in using after accepting without mindfulness."



[127.] Use of the requisites by the seven kinds of trainers is
called "use as an inheritance"; for they are the Buddha's sons,
therefore they make use of the requisites as the heirs of requisites
belonging to their father. But how then, is it the Blessed One's
requisites or the laity's requisites that are used? Although given by
the laity, they actually belong to the Blessed One, because it is by the
Blessed One that they are permitted. That is why it should be understood
that the Blessed One's requisites are used. The confirmation here is in
the Dhammadāyāda Sutta (MN 3).



Use by those whose cankers are destroyed is called "use as a master";
for they



make use of them as masters because they have escaped the slavery of
craving.



[128.] As regards these kinds of use, use as a master and use
as an inheritance are allowable for all. Use as a debt is not allowable,
to say nothing of use as theft. But this use of what is reviewed by one
who is virtuous is use freed from debt because it is the opposite of use
as a debt or is included in use as an inheritance too. For one possessed
of virtue is called a trainer too because of possessing this training.



[129.] As regards these three kinds of use, since use as a
master is best, when a bhikkhu undertakes *virtue dependent on
requisites*, he should aspire to that and use them after reviewing them
in the way described. And this is said: \[45\]



"The truly wise disciple\
Who listens to the Dhamma\
As taught by the Sublime One\
Makes use, after reviewing,\
Of alms food, and of dwelling,\
And of a resting place,\
And also of the water\
For washing dirt from robes" (Sn 391).



"So like a drop of water\
Lying on leaves of lotus,\
A bhikkhu is unsullied\
By any of these matters,\
By alms food, \[and by dwelling,\]\
And by a resting place,\
And also by the water\
For washing dirt from robes" (Sn 392).

"Since aid it is and timely\
Procured from another\
The right amount he reckons,\
Mindful without remitting\
In chewing and in eating,\
In tasting food besides:\
He treats it as an ointment\
Applied upon a wound." (Source untraced)



"So like the child's flesh in the desert\
Like the greasing for the axle,\
He should eat without delusion\
Nutriment to keep alive." (Source untraced)



[130.] And in connection with the fulfilling of this virtue
dependent on requisites there should be told the story of the novice
Saṅgharakkhita the Nephew. For he made use of requisites after
reviewing, according as it is said:



"Seeing me eat a dish of rice\
Quite cold, my preceptor observed:\
'Novice, if you are not restrained,\
Be careful not to burn your tongue.'\
On hearing my Preceptor's words,\
I then and there felt urged to act\
And, sitting in a single session,\
I reached the goal of Arahantship.\
Since I am now waxed full in thought\
Like the full moon of the fifteenth (M III 277),\
And all my cankers are destroyed,\
There is no more becoming now." \[46\]



And so should any other man\
Aspiring to end suffering\
Make use of all the requisites\
Wisely after reviewing them.



So virtue is of four kinds as "virtue of Pātimokkha restraint," and so
on.



[131.] *18.* In the first pentad in the fivefold section the
meaning should be understood in accordance with the virtue of those not
fully admitted to the Order, and so on. For this is said in the
Paṭisambhidā: "(a) What is virtue consisting in limited purification?
That of the training precepts for those not fully admitted to the Order:
such is virtue consisting in limited purification. (b) What is virtue
consisting in unlimited purification? That of the training precepts for
those fully admitted to the Order: such is virtue consisting in
unlimited purification. (c) What is virtue consisting in fulfilled
purification? That of magnanimous ordinary men devoted to profitable
things, who are perfecting \[the course\] that ends in trainership,
regardless of the physical body and life, having given up \[attachment
to\] life: such is virtue of fulfilled purification, (d) What is virtue
consisting in purification not adhered to? That of the seven kinds of
trainer: such is virtue consisting in purification not adhered to. (e)
What is virtue consisting in tranquillized purification? That of the
Perfect One's



[]



[]



disciples with cankers destroyed, of the Paccekabuddhas, of the Perfect
Ones, accomplished and fully enlightened: such is virtue consisting in
tranquillized purification" (Paṭis I 42--43).



[132.] (a) Herein, the virtue of those not fully admitted to
the Order should be understood as *virtue consisting in limited
purification*, because it is limited by the number \[of training
precepts, that is, five or eight or ten\].



\(b\) That of those fully admitted to the Order is \[describable\] thus:



Nine thousand millions, and a hundred\
And eighty millions then as well,\
And fifty plus a hundred thousand,\
And thirty-six again to swell.



The total restraint disciplines:\
These rules the Enlightened One explains\
Told under heads for filling out,\
Which the Discipline restraint contains.35



So although limited in number, \[47\] it should yet be understood as
*virtue* *consisting in unlimited purification*, since it is undertaken
without reserve and has no obvious limit such as gain, fame, relatives,
limbs or life. Like the virtue of the Elder Mahā Tissa the Mango-eater
who lived at Cīragumba (see §122 above).



[133.] For that venerable one never abandoned the following
good man's recollection:



"Wealth for a sound limb's sake should be renounced,\
And one who guards his life gives up his limbs;\
And wealth and limbs and life, each one of these,\
A man gives up who practices the Dhamma."



And he never transgressed a training precept even when his life was in
the balance, and in this way he reached Arahantship with that same
virtue of unlimited purification as his support while he was being
carried on a lay devotee's back. According to as it is said:



"Nor your mother nor your father\
Nor your relatives and kin\
Have done as much as this for you\
Because you are possessed of virtue."\
So, stirred with urgency, and wisely\
Comprehending36 with insight,



35\. The figures depend on whether *koṭi* is taken as 1,000,000 or
100,000 or 10,000.



36\. "Comprehending" (*sammasana*) is a technical term that will become
clear in Chapter XX. In short, it is inference that generalizes the
"three characteristics" from one's own directly-known experience to all
possible formed experience at all times (see S II 107). Commenting on
"*He comprehended that same illness*" (§138), Vism-mhṭ says: "He
exercised insight by discerning the feeling in the illness under the
heading of the feeling \[aggregate\] and the remaining material dhammas
as materiality" (Vism-mhṭ 65).

[]



While carried on his helper's back\
He reached the goal of Arahantship.



[134.] (c) The magnanimous ordinary man's virtue, which from
the time of admission to the Order is devoid even of the stain of a
\[wrong\] thought because of its extreme purity, like a gem of purest
water, like well-refined gold, becomes the proximate cause for
Arahantship itself, which is why it is called *consisting of fulfilled
purification*; like that of the lders Saṅgharakkhita the Great and
Saṅgharakkhita the Nephew.



[135.] The Elder Saṅgharakkhita the Great (*Mahā
Saṅgharakkhita*), aged over sixty, was lying, it seems, on his deathbed.
The Order of Bhikkhus questioned him about attainment of the
supramundane state. The elder said: "I have no supramundane state." Then
the young bhikkhu who was attending on him said: "Venerable sir, people
have come as much as twelve leagues, thinking that you have reached
Nibbāna. It will be a disappointment for many if you die as an ordinary
man."--- "Friend, thinking to see the Blessed One Metteyya, I did not
try for insight. \[48\] So help me to sit up and give me the chance." He
helped the elder to sit up and went out. As he went out the elder
reached Arahantship and he gave a sign by snapping his fingers. The
Order assembled and said to him: "Venerable sir, you have done a
difficult thing in achieving the supramundane state in the hour of
death."---"That was not difficult, friends. But rather I will tell you
what is difficult. Friends, I see no action done \[by me\] without
mindfulness and unknowingly since the time I went forth." His nephew
also reached Arahantship in the same way at the age of fifty years.



[136.] "Now, if a man has little learning And he is careless of
his virtue,\
They censure him on both accounts\
For lack of virtue and of learning.



"But if he is of little learning\
Yet he is careful of his virtue,\
They praise him for his virtue, so\
It is as though he too had learning.



"And if he is of ample learning\
Yet he is careless of his virtue,\
They blame him for his virtue, so\
It is as though he had no learning.



"But if he is of ample learning\
And he is careful of his virtue,\
They give him praise on both accounts\
For virtue and as well for learning.



"The Buddha's pupil of much learning\
Who keeps the Law with understanding---\
A jewel of Jambu River gold37\
Who is here fit to censure him?



37\. A story of the Jambu River and its gold is given at M-a IV 147.



[]



[]



Deities praise him \[constantly\],\
By Brahmā also is he praised (A II 7).



[137.] (d) What should be understood as *virtue consisting in
purification* *not adhered* *to * is trainers' virtue, because it is* *
not adhered to by \[false\] view, and ordinary men's virtue when not
adhered to by greed. Like the virtue of the Elder Tissa the Landowner's
Son (*Kuṭumbiyaputta-Tissa-thera*). Wanting to become established in
Arahantship in dependence on such virtue, this venerable one told his
enemies:



I broke the bones of both my legs\
To give the pledge you asked from me.\
I am revolted and ashamed\
At death accompanied by greed. \[49\]



"And after I had thought on this,\
And wisely then applied insight,\
When the sun rose and shone on me,\
I had become an Arahant" (M-a I 233).



[138.] Also there was a certain senior elder who was very ill
and unable to eat with his own hand. He was writhing smeared with his
own urine and excrement. Seeing him, a certain young bhikkhu said, "Oh,
what a painful process life is!" The senior elder told him: "If I were
to die now, friend, I should obtain the bliss of heaven; I have no doubt
of that. But the bliss obtained by breaking this virtue would be like
the lay state obtained by disavowing the training," and he added: "I
shall die together with my virtue." As he lay there, he comprehended
that same illness \[with insight\], and he reached Arahantship. Having
done so, he pronounced these verses to the Order of Bhikkhus:



"I am victim of a sickening disease\
That racks me with its burden of cruel pain;\
As flowers in the dust burnt by the sun,\
So this my corpse will soon have withered up.



"Unbeautiful called beautiful,\
Unclean while reckoned as if clean,\
Though full of ordure seeming fair\
To him that cannot see it clear.



"So out upon this ailing rotting body,\
Fetid and filthy, punished with affliction,\
Doting on which this silly generation\
Has lost the way to be reborn in heaven!" (J-a II 437)



[139.] (e) It is the virtue of the Arahants, etc., that should
be understood *as* *tranquillized purification*, because of
tranquillization of all disturbance and because of purifiedness.



So it is of five kinds as "consisting in limited purification," and so
on.



[140.] *19.* In the second pentad the meaning should be
understood as the abandoning, etc., of killing living things, etc.; for
this is said in the Paṭisambhidā: "Five kinds of virtue: (1) In the case
of killing living things, (a) abandoning is

\(26\) "Through the contemplation of impermanence in the case of the

Through the contemplation of not-self in the case of the perception of

[]



\(44\) "Through the path of stream-entry in the case of defilements
coefficient with \[false\] view, (a) abandoning is virtue ... (45)
Through the path of once-return in the case of gross defilements ...
(46) Through the path of non-return in the case of residual defilements
... (47) Through the path of Arahantship in the case of all defilements,
(a) abandoning is virtue, (b) abstention is virtue, (c) volition is
virtue, (d) restraint is virtue, (e) non-transgression is virtue.



"Such virtues lead to non-remorse in the mind, to gladdening, to
happiness, to tranquillity, to joy, to repetition, to development, to
cultivation, to embellishment, to the requisite \[for concentration\],
to the equipment \[of concentration\], to fulfilment, to complete
dispassion, to fading away, to cessation, to peace, to direct-knowledge,
to enlightenment, to Nibbāna."38 (Paṭis I 46--47)



[141.]And here there is no state called abandoning other than
the mere non-arising of the killing of living things, etc., as stated.
But the abandoning of a given \[unprofitable state\] upholds \[51\] a
given profitable state in the sense of providing a foundation for it,
and concentrates it by preventing wavering, so it is called "virtue"
(*sīla*) in the sense of composing (*sīlana*), reckoned as upholding and
concentrating as stated earlier (§19).



The other four things mentioned refer to the presence39 of occurrence of
will as abstention from such and such, as restraint of such and such, as
the volition associated with both of these, and as non-transgression in
one who does not transgress such and such. But their meaning of virtue
has been explained already.



So it is of five kinds as "virtue consisting in abandoning" and so on.



[142.] At this point the answers to the questions, "What is
virtue? In what sense is it virtue? What are its characteristic,
function, manifestation, and proximate cause? What are the benefits of
virtue? How many kinds of virtue are there?" are complete.



[143.] However, it was also asked (vi) *WHAT IS THE DEFILING OF
IT?* and *WHAT IS THE CLEANSING OF IT?*



We answer that virtue's tornness, etc., is its defiling, and that its
untornness, etc., is its cleansing. Now, that tornness, etc., are
comprised under the breach that has gain, fame, etc., as its cause, and
under the seven bonds of sexuality. When a man has broken the training
course at the beginning or at the end in any instance of the seven
classes of offences,40 his virtue is called torn, like a cloth that is
cut at the edge. But when he has broken it in the middle, it is called
rent, like a cloth that



38\. This list describes, in terms of abandoning, etc., the stages in
the normal progress from ignorance to Arahantship, and it falls into the
following groups: I. *Virtue*: the abandoning of the ten unprofitable
courses of action (1--10). II. *Concentration*: A. abandoning the seven
hindrances to concentration by means of their opposites (11-- 17); B.
The eight attainments of concentration, and what is abandoned by each
(18--25). III.  *Understanding*: A. Insight: the eighteen principal
insights beginning with the seven contemplations (26--43). B. Paths: The
four paths and what is abandoned by each (44--47).



39\. *Sabbhāva---*"presence" ( = *sat* + *bhāva*): not in PED. Not to be
confused with *sabhāva---* "individual essence" ( = *sa* (Skr. *sva*) +
*bhāva*, or *saha* + *bhāva*).\



40\. The seven consisting of *pārājikā*,  *saṅghādisesā*,  *pācittiyā*, 
*pāṭidesanīyā, dukkaṭā*, *thullaccayā*, *dubbhāsitā* (mentioned at M-a
II 33).

[]



is rent in the middle. When he has broken it twice or thrice in
succession, it is called blotched, like a cow whose body is some such
colour as black or red with a discrepant colour appearing on the back or
the belly. When he has broken it \[all over\] at intervals, it is called
mottled, like a cow speckled \[all over\] with discrepant- coloured
spots at intervals. This in the first place, is how there comes to be
tornness with the breach that has gain, etc., as its cause.



[144.]And likewise with the seven bonds of sexuality; for this
is said by the Blessed One: "Here, brahman, some ascetic or brahman
claims to lead the life of purity rightly; for he does not \[52\] enter
into actual sexual intercourse with women. Yet he agrees to massage,
manipulation, bathing and rubbing down by women. He enjoys it, desires
it and takes satisfaction in it. This is what is torn, rent, blotched
and mottled in one who leads the life of purity. This man is said to
lead a life of purity that is unclean. As one who is bound by the bond
of sexuality, he will not be released from birth, ageing and death ...
he will not be released from suffering, I say.



[145.] "Furthermore, brahman, ... while he does not agree to
\[these things\], yet he



jokes, plays and amuses himself with women ...



[146.] "Furthermore, brahman, ... while he does not agree to
\[these things\], yet he gazes and stares at women eye to eye ...



[147.] "Furthermore, brahman, ... while he does not agree to
\[these things\], yet he listens to the sound of women through a wall or
through a fence as they laugh or talk or sing or weep ...



[148.] "Furthermore, brahman, ... while he does not agree to
\[these things\], yet he



recalls laughs and talks and games that he formerly had with women ...



[149.] "Furthermore, brahman, ... while he does not agree to
\[these things\], \[53\] yet he sees a householder or a householder's
son possessed of, endowed with, and indulging in, the five cords of
sense desire ...



[150.] "Furthermore, brahman, while he does not agree to
\[these things\], yet he leads the life of purity aspiring to some order
of deities, \[thinking\] 'Through this rite (virtue) or this ritual
(vow) or this asceticism I shall become a \[great\] deity or some
\[lesser\] deity.' He enjoys it, desires it, and takes satisfaction in
it. This, brahman, is what is torn, rent, blotched and mottled in one
who leads the life of purity. This man ... will not be released from
suffering, I say" (A IV 54--56).



This is how tornness, etc., should be understood as included under the
breach



that has gain, etc., as its cause and under the seven bonds of
sexuality.



[151.]Untornness, however, is accomplished by the complete
non-breaking of the training precepts, by making amends for those broken
for which amends should be made, by the absence of the seven bonds of
sexuality, and, as well, by the non- arising of such evil things as
anger, enmity, contempt, domineering, envy, avarice, deceit, fraud,
obduracy, presumption, pride (conceit), haughtiness, conceit (vanity),
and negligence (MN 7), and by the arising of such qualities as fewness
of wishes, contentment, and effacement (MN 24).



[]



[]



[152.] Virtues not broken for the purpose of gain, etc., and
rectified by making amends after being broken by the faults of
negligence, etc., and not damaged by the bonds of sexuality and by such
evil things as anger and enmity, are called entirely untorn, unrent,
unblotched, and unmottled. And those same virtues are *liberating* since
they bring about the state of a freeman, and praised by the wise since
it is by the wise that they are praised, and *unadhered*-*to* since they
are not adhered to by means of craving and views, and *conducive to
concentration* since they conduce to access concentration or to
absorption concentration. That is why their untornness, etc., should be
understood as "cleansing" (see also VII.101f.).



[153.]This cleansing comes about in two ways: through seeing
the danger of failure in virtue, and through seeing the benefit of
perfected virtue. \[54\] Herein, the danger of failure in virtue can be
seen in accordance with such suttas as that beginning, "Bhikkhus, there
are these five dangers for the unvirtuous in the failure of virtue" (A
III 252).



[154.] Furthermore, on account of his unvirtuousness an
unvirtuous person is displeasing to deities and human beings, is
uninstructable by his fellows in the life of purity, suffers when
unvirtuousness is censured, and is remorseful when the virtuous are
praised. Owing to that unvirtuousness he is as ugly as hemp cloth.
Contact with him is painful because those who fall in with his views are
brought to long-lasting suffering in the states of loss. He is worthless
because he causes no great fruit \[to accrue\] to those who give him
gifts. He is as hard to purify as a cesspit many years old. He is like a
log from a pyre (see It 99); for he is outside both \[recluseship and
the lay state\]. Though claiming the bhikkhu state he is no bhikkhu, so
he is like a donkey following a herd of cattle. He is always nervous,
like a man who is everyone's enemy. He is as unfit to live with as a
dead carcase. Though he may have the qualities of learning, etc., he is
as unfit for the homage of his fellows in the life of purity as a
charnel-ground fire is for that of brahmans. He is as incapable of
reaching the distinction of attainment as a blind man is of seeing a
visible object. He is as careless of the Good Law as a guttersnipe is of
a kingdom. Though he fancies he is happy, yet he suffers because he
reaps suffering as told in the Discourse on the Mass of Fire (A IV
128--34).



[155.]Now, the Blessed One has shown that when the unvirtuous
have their minds captured by pleasure and satisfaction in the indulgence
of the five cords of sense desires, in \[receiving\] salutation, in
being honoured, etc., the result of that kamma, directly visible in all
ways, is very violent pain, with that \[kamma\] as its condition,
capable of producing a gush of hot blood by causing agony of heart with
the mere recollection of it. Here is the text:



"Bhikkhus, do you see that great mass of fire burning, blazing and
glowing?--- Yes, venerable sir.---What do you think, bhikkhus, which is
better, that one \[gone forth\] should sit down or lie down embracing
that mass of fire burning, blazing and glowing, or that he should sit
down or lie down embracing a warrior-noble maiden or a brahman maiden or
a maiden of householder family, with soft, delicate hands and feet?---It
would be better, venerable sir, that he should sit down or lie down
embracing a warrior-noble maiden ... \[55\] It would be painful,
venerable sir,



[]



[]



if he sat down or lay down embracing that great mass of fire burning,
blazing and glowing.



[156.] "I say to you, bhikkhus, I declare to you, bhikkhus,
that it would be better for one \[gone forth\] who is unvirtuous, who is
evil-natured, of unclean and suspect habits, secretive of his acts, who
is not an ascetic and claims to be one, who does not lead the life of
purity and claims to do so, who is rotten within, lecherous, and full of
corruption, to sit down or lie down embracing that great mass of fire
burning, blazing and glowing. Why is that? By his doing so, bhikkhus, he
might come to death or deadly suffering, yet he would not on that
account, on the breakup of the body, after death, reappear in states of
loss, in an unhappy destiny, in perdition, in hell. But if one who is
unvirtuous, evil-natured ... and full of corruption, should sit down or
lie down embracing a warrior-noble maiden ... that would be long for his
harm and suffering: on the break-up of the body, after death, he would
reappear in states of loss, in an unhappy destiny, in perdition, in
hell" (A IV 128--29).



[157.]Having thus shown by means of the analogy of the mass of
fire the suffering that is bound up with women and has as its condition
the indulgence of the five cords of sense desires \[by the unvirtuous\],
to the same intent he showed, by the following similes of the horse-hair
rope, the sharp spear, the iron sheet, the iron ball, the iron bed, the
iron chair, and the iron cauldron, the pain that has as its condition
\[acceptance of\] homage and reverential salutation, and the use of
robes, alms food, bed and chair, and dwelling \[by unvirtuous
bhikkhus\]:



"What do you think, bhikkhus, which is better, that one should have a
strong horse- hair rope twisted round both legs by a strong man and
tightened so that it cut through the outer skin, and having cut through
the outer skin it cut through the inner skin, and having cut through the
inner skin it cut through the flesh, and having cut through the flesh it
cut through the sinews, and having cut through the sinews it cut through
the bones, and having cut through the bones it remained crushing the
bone marrow---or that he should consent to the homage of great
warrior-nobles, great brahmans, great householders?" (A IV 129). \[56\]



And: "What do you think, bhikkhus, which is better, that one should have
a strong man wound one's breast with a sharp spear tempered in oil---or
that he should consent to the reverential salutation of great
warrior-nobles, great brahmans, great householders?" (A IV 130).



And: "What do you think, bhikkhus, which is better, that one's body
should be wrapped by a strong man in a red-hot iron sheet burning,
blazing and glowing--- or that he should use robes given out of faith by
great warrior-nobles, great brahmans, great householders?" (A IV
130--31).



And: "What do you think, bhikkhus, which is better, that one's mouth
should be prised open by a strong man with red-hot iron tongs burning,
blazing and glowing, and that into his mouth should be put a red-hot
iron ball burning, blazing and glowing, which burns his lips and burns
his mouth and tongue and throat and belly and passes out below carrying
with it his bowels and entrails---or that he should use alms food given
out of faith by great warrior-nobles ...?" (A IV 131--32).



[]



[]



And: "What do you think, bhikkhus, which is better, that one should have
a strong man seize him by the head or seize him by the shoulders and
seat him or lay him on a red-hot iron bed or iron chair, burning,
blazing and glowing---or that he should use a bed or chair given out of
faith by great warrior-nobles ... ?" (A IV 132--33).



And: "What do you think, bhikkhus, which is better, that one should have
a strong man take him feet up and head down and plunge him into a
red-hot metal cauldron burning, blazing and glowing, to be boiled there
in a swirl of froth, and as he boils in the swirl of froth to be swept
now up, now down, and now across---or that he should use a dwelling
given out of faith by great warrior-nobles ... ?" (A IV 133--34).



[158.] What pleasure has a man of broken virtue Forsaking not
sense pleasures, which bear fruit\
Of pain more violent even than the pain\
In the embracing of a mass of fire?



What pleasure has he in accepting homage\
Who, having failed in virtue, must partake\
Of pain that will excel in agony\
The crushing of his legs with horse-hair ropes? \[57\]



What pleasure has a man devoid of virtue\
Accepting salutations of the faithful,\
Which is the cause of pain acuter still\
Than pain produced by stabbing with a spear?



What is the pleasure in the use of garments\
For one without restraint, whereby in hell\
He will for long be forced to undergo\
The contact of the blazing iron sheet?



Although to him his alms food may seem tasty,\
Who has no virtue, it is direst poison,\
Because of which he surely will be made\
For long to swallow burning iron balls.



And when the virtueless make use of couches\
And chairs, though reckoned pleasing, it is pain\
Because they will be tortured long indeed\
On red-hot blazing iron beds and chairs.



Then what delight is there for one unvirtuous\
Inhabiting a dwelling given in faith,\
Since for that reason he will have to dwell\
Shut up inside a blazing iron pan?



The Teacher of the world, in him condemning,\
Described him in these terms: "Of suspect habits,\
Full of corruption, lecherous as well,\
By nature evil, rotten too within."



So out upon the life of him abiding\
Without restraint, of him that wears the guise



[]



[]



Of the ascetic that he will not be,\
And damages and undermines himself!



What is the life he leads, since any person,\
No matter who, with virtue to his credit\
Avoids it here, as those that would look well\
Keep far away from dung or from a corpse?



He is not free from any sort of terror,\
Though free enough from pleasure of attainment;\
While heaven's door is bolted fast against him,\
He is well set upon the road to hell.



Who else if not one destitute of virtue\
More fit to be the object of compassion?\
Many indeed and grave are the defects\
That brand a man neglectful of his virtue.



Seeing danger in the failure of virtue should be understood as reviewing
in such ways as these. And seeing benefits in perfected vir-tue should
be understood in the opposite sense.



[159.] Furthermore: \[58\]



His virtue is immaculate,\
His wearing of the bowl and robes\
Gives pleasure and inspires trust,\
His going forth will bear its fruit.



A bhikkhu in his virtue pure\
Has never fear that self-reproach\
Will enter in his heart: indeed\
There is no darkness in the sun.



A bhikkhu in his virtue bright\
Shines forth in the Ascetics' Wood41\
As by the brightness of his beams\
The moon lights up the firmament.



Now, if the bodily perfume\
Of virtuous bhikkhus can succeed\
In pleasing even deities,\
What of the perfume of his virtue?



It is more perfect far than all\
The other perfumes in the world,\
Because the perfume virtue gives\
Is borne unchecked in all directions.



The deeds done for a virtuous man,\
Though they be few, will bear much fruit,



41\. An allusion to the Gosiṅga Suttas (MN 31, 32).



[]



[]



And so the virtuous man becomes\
A vessel of honour and renown.



There are no cankers here and now\
To plague the virtuous man at all;\
The virtuous man digs out the root\
Of suffering in lives to come.



Perfection among human kind\
And even among deities.\
If wished for, is not hard to gain\
For him whose virtue is perfected;



But once his virtue is perfected,\
His mind then seeks no other kind\
han the perfection of Nibbāna,\
The state where utter peace prevails.



Such is the blessed fruit of virtue,\
Showing full many a varied form,\
So let a wise man know it well\
This root of all perfection's branches.



[160.] The mind of one who understands thus, shudders at
failure in virtue and reaches out towards the perfecting of virtue. So
virtue should be cleansed with all care, seeing this danger of failure
in virtue and this benefit of the perfection of virtue in the way
stated.



[161.]And at this point in the *Path of Purification*, which is
shown under the headings of virtue, concentration and understanding by
the stanza, "When a wise man, established well in virtue" (§1), virtue,
firstly, has been fully illustrated.



The first chapter called "The Description of Virtue" in the *Path of
Purification* composed for the purpose of gladdening good people.

## CHAPTER II 


THE ASCETIC PRACTICES



(*Dhutaṅga-niddesa*)



[1.]\[59\] Now, while a meditator is engaged in the pursuit of
virtue, he should set about undertaking the ascetic practices in order
to perfect those special qualities of fewness of wishes, contentment,
etc., by which the virtue of the kind already described, is cleansed.
For when his virtue is thus washed clean of stains by the waters of such
special qualities as fewness of wishes, contentment, effacement,
seclusion, dispersal, energy, and modest needs, it will become quite
purified; and his vows will succeed as well. And-- so, when his whole
behaviour has been purified by the special quality of blameless virtue
and vows and he has become established in the \[first\] three of the
ancient Noble Ones' heritages, he may become worthy to attain to the
fourth called "delight in development" (A II 27). We shall therefore
begin the explanation of the ascetic practices.



\[THE 13 KINDS OF ASCETIC PRACTICES\]



[2.]Thirteen kinds of ascetic practices have been allowed by
the Blessed One to clansmen who have given up the things of the flesh
and, regardless of body and life, are desirous of undertaking a practice
in conformity \[with their aim\]. They are:



i\. the refuse-rag-wearer's practice,



ii\. the triple-robe-wearer's practice,



iii\. the alms-food-eater's practice,



iv\. the house-to-house-seeker's practice,



v\. the one-sessioner's practice,



vi\. the bowl-food-eater's practice,



vii\. the later-food-refuser's practice,



viii\. the forest-dweller's practice,



ix\. the tree-root-dweller's practice,



x\. the open-air-dweller's practice,



xi\. the charnel-ground-dweller's practice,



xii\. the any-bed-user's practice,



xiii\. the sitter's practice.



[3.]Herein:



\(1\) As to meaning, (2) characteristic, et cetera,\
(3) The undertaking and directions,


[]



[]



And then the grade, and breach as well,\
And benefits of each besides,\
(4) As to the profitable triad,\
(5) "Ascetic" and so on distinguished,\
(6) And as to groups, and also (7) singly,\
The exposition should be known. \[60\]



[4.]1. Herein, *as to meaning*, in the first place.



i\. It is "refuse" (*paṃsukūla*) since, owing to its being found on
refuse in any such place as a street, a charnel ground, or a midden, it
belongs, as it were, to the refuse in the sense of being dumped in
anyone of these places. Or alternatively: like refuse it gets to a vile
state (*PAÍSU viya KUcchitabhāvaṃ ULAti*), thus it is "refuse"
(*paṃsukūla*); it goes to a vile state, is what is meant. The wearing of
a refuse-\[rag\], which has acquired its derivative name1 in this way,
is "refuse-\[rag- wearing\]" (*paṃsukūla*). That is his habit, thus he
is a "refuse-\[rag-wear-\]er" (*paṃsukūlika*). The practice (*aṅga*) of
the refuse-\[rag-wear-\]er is the "refuse-\[rag- wear-\]er's practice"
(*paṃsukūlikaṅga*). It is the action that is called the "practice."
Therefore it should be understood as a term for that by undertaking
which one becomes a refuse-\[rag-wear-\]er.



ii\. In the same way, he has the habit of \[wearing\] the triple robe
(*ti-cīvara*)---in other words, the cloak of patches, the upper garment,
and the inner clothing--- thus he is a "triple-robe-\[wear-\]er"
(*tecīvarika*). His practice is called the "triple- robe-wearer's
practice."



[5.]iii. The dropping (*pāta*) of the lumps (*piṇḍa*) of
material sustenance (*āmisa*) called alms (*bhikkhā*) is "alms food"
(*piṇḍapāta*); the falling (*nipatana*) into the bowl of lumps (*piṇḍa*)
given by others, is what is meant. He gleans that alms food (that
falling of lumps), he seeks it by approaching such and such a family,
thus he is called an "alms-food \[eat-\]er" (*piṇḍapātika*). Or his vow
is to gather (*patituṃ*)2 the lump (*piṇḍa*), thus he is a
"lump-gatherer" (*piṇḍapātin*). To "gather" is to wander for. A
"lump-gatherer" (*piṇḍapātin*) is the same as an "alms-food-eater"
(*piṇḍapātika*). The practice of the alms-food-eater is the
"alms-food-eater's practice."



[6.]iv. It is a hiatus (*avakhaṇḍana*) that is called a "gap"
(*dāna*).3 It is removed (*apeta*) from a gap, thus it is called
"gapless" (*apadāna*); the meaning is, it is without hiatus. It is
together with (*saha*) what is gapless (*apadāna*), thus it is "with the
gapless" (*sapadāna*); devoid of hiatus---from house to house---is what
is meant. His habit is to wander on what-is-with-the-gapless, thus he is
a "gapless wanderer" (*sapadāna- cārin*). A gapless wanderer is the same
as a "house-to-house-seeker" (*sapadāna- cārika*). His practice is the
"house-to-house-seeker's practice."



[7.]v. Eating in one session is "one-session." He has that
habit, thus he is a "one- sessioner." His practice is the
"one-sessioner's practice."



1\. *Nibbacana---"*derivative name (or verbal derivative)"; gram. term
not in PED; M-a I 61,105; Vism XVI.16.\



2\. *Patati---"*to gather (or to wander)": not in PED.\



3\. *Avakhaṇḍana---*"hiatus" and *dāna---"*gap*"*: not in PED.



[]



[]



vi\. Alms (*piṇḍa*) in one bowl (*patta*) only because of refusing a
second vessel, is "bowl-alms" (*patta*-*piṇḍa*). Now, making "bowl alms"
(*patta*-*piṇḍa*) the name for the taking of alms food in the bowl:
bowl-alms-food is his habit, thus he is a "bowl- food-eater"
(*pattapiṇḍika*). His practice is the "bowl-food-eater's practice."



[8.]vii. "No" (*khalu*) is a particle in the sense of refusing.
\[61\] Food (*bhatta*) obtained later by one who has shown that he is
satisfied is called "later-food" (*pacchā-bhatta*). The eating of that
later food is "later-food-eating." Making "later-food" (*pacchā-
bhatta*) the name for that later-food-eating: later-food is his habit,
thus he is a "later- food-\[eat-\]er" (*pacchābhattika*). Not a
later-food-eater is a "no-later-food-\[eat-\]er"
(*khalu-pacchābhattika*), \[that is, a "later-food-refuser"\]. This is
the name for one who as an undertaking refuses extra food. But it is
said in the commentary4 "Khalu is a certain kind of bird. When it has
taken a fruit into its beak and that drops, it does not eat any more.
This \[bhikkhu\] is like that." Thus he is "a later-food-refuser"
(*khalu-pacchā-bhattika*). His practice is the "later-food-refuser's
practice."



[9.]viii. His habit is dwelling in the forest, thus he is a
"forest-dweller." His practice is the "forest-dweller's practice."



ix\. Dwelling at the root of a tree is "tree-root-dwelling." He has that
habit, thus he is a "tree-root-dweller." The practice of the
tree-root-dweller is the "tree-root- dweller's practice."



x., xi. Likewise with the open-air-dweller and the
charnel-ground-dweller.



[10.] xii. Only what has been distributed (*yad eva santhata*)
is "as distributed" (*yathāsanthata*). This is a term for the resting
place first allotted thus "This one falls to you." He has the habit of
dwelling in that as distributed, thus he is an "as- distributed-user"
(*yathāsanthatika*), \[that is, an "any-bed-user"\]. His practice is the
"any-bed-user's practice."



xiii\. He has the habit of keeping to the sitting \[posture when
resting\], refusing



to lie down, thus he is a "sitter." His practice is the "sitter's
practice."



[11.]All these, however, are the practices (*aṅga*) of a
bhikkhu who is ascetic (*dhuta*) because he has shaken off (*dhuta*)
defilement by undertaking one or other of them. Or the knowledge that
has got the name "ascetic" (*dhuta*) because it shakes off (*dhunana*)
defilement is a practice (*aṅga*) belonging to these, thus they are
"ascetic practices" (*dhutaṅga*). Or alternatively, they are ascetic
(*dhuta*) because they shake off (*niddhunana*) opposition, and they are
practices (*aṅga*) because they are a way (*paṭipatti*).



This, firstly, is how the exposition should be known here as to meaning.



[12.]All of them have as their characteristic the
volition of undertaking. For this is said \[in the commentary\]: "He who
does the undertaking is a person. That whereby he does the undertaking
is states of consciousness and consciousness- concomitants. The volition
of the act of undertaking is the ascetic practice. What it rejects is
the instance." All have the function of eliminating cupidity, and they



4\. Such references to "the Commentary" are to the old Sinhalese
commentary, no longer extant, from which Bhadantācariya Buddhaghosa drew
his material.



[]



[]



manifest themselves with the production of non-cupidity. For their
proximate cause they have the noble states consisting of fewness of
wishes, and so on. \[62\] This is how the exposition should be known *as
to characteristic, etc*., here.



[13.] *3.* As regards the five beginning with *the undertaking*
and *directions*: during the Blessed One's lifetime all ascetic
practices should be undertaken in the Blessed One's presence. After his
attainment of Nibbāna this should be done in the presence of a principal
disciple. When he is not available it should be done in the presence of
one whose cankers are destroyed, of a non-returner, of a once-returner,
of a stream-enterer, of one who knows the three Piṭakas, of one who
knows two of the Piṭakas, of one who knows one of the Piṭakas, of one
who knows one Collection,5 of a teacher of the Commentaries. When he is
not available it should be done in the presence of an observer of an
ascetic practice. When he is not available, then after one has swept out
the shrine terrace they can be undertaken seated in a reverential
posture as though pronouncing them in the Fully Enlightened One's
presence. Also it is permitted to undertake them by oneself.



And here should be told the story of the senior of the two brothers who
were elders at Cetiyapabbata and their fewness of wishes with respect to
the ascetic practices6 (M-a II 140).



This, firstly, is what applies to all \[the practices\].



[14.]Now, we shall proceed to comment on the undertaking,
directions, grade, breach and benefits, of each one \[separately\].



i\. First, the *refuse-rag-wearer's practice* is undertaken with one of
these two statements: "I refuse robes given by householders" or "I
undertake the refuse-rag- wearer's practice." This, firstly, is the
*undertaking*.



[15.]One who has done this should get a robe of one of the
following kinds: one from a charnel ground, one from a shop, a cloth
from a street, a cloth from a midden, one from a childbed, an ablution
cloth, a cloth from a washing place, one worn going to and returning
from \[the charnel ground\], one scorched by fire, one gnawed by cattle,
one gnawed by ants, one gnawed by rats, one cut at the end, one cut at
the edge, one carried as a flag, a robe from a shrine, an ascetic's
robe, one from a consecration, one produced by supernormal power, one
from a highway, one borne by the wind, one presented by deities, one
from the sea. Taking one of these robe cloths, he should tear off and
throw away the weak parts, and then wash the sound parts and make up a
robe. He can use it after getting rid of his old robe given by
householders.



[16.]Herein, "*one from a charnel ground*" is one dropped on a
charnel ground.



5\. "*'Ekasaṅgītika':* one who knows one of the five collections
*(nikāya)* beginning with the Collection of Long Discourses (Dīgha
Nikāya). (Vism-mhṭ 76)"



6\. "That elder, it seems, was a sitter, but no one knew it. Then one
night the other saw him by the light of a flash of lightning sitting up
on his bed. He asked, 'Are you a sitter, venerable sir?' Out of fewness
of wishes that his ascetic practice should get known, the elder lay
down. Afterwards he undertook the practice anew. So the story has come
down. (Vism-mhṭ 77)"



[]



[]



"*One from a shop*" is one dropped at the door of a shop.



"*A cloth from a street*" is a cloth thrown into a street from inside a
window by



those who seek merit.



"*A cloth from a midden*" \[63\] is a cloth thrown onto a place for
rubbish.



"*One from a childbed*" is a cloth thrown away after wiping up the
stains of childbirth with it. The mother of Tissa the Minister, it
seems, had the stains of childbirth wiped up with a cloth worth a
hundred \[pieces\], and thinking, "The refuse-rag wearers will take it,"
she had it thrown onto the Tālaveli Road.7 Bhikkhus took it for the
purpose of mending worn places.



[17.] "*An ablution cloth*" is one that people who are made by
devil doctors to bathe themselves, including their heads, are accustomed
to throw away as a "cloth of ill luck."



"*A cloth from washing place*" is rags thrown away at a washing place
where bathing



is done.



"*One worn going to and coming from*" is one that people throw away
after they



have gone to a charnel ground and returned and bathed.



"*One scorched by fire*" is one partly scorched by fire; for people
throw that away.



"*One gnawed by cattle,*" etc., are obvious; for people throw away such
as these



too.



"*One carried as a flag*": Those who board a ship do so after hoisting a
flag. It is allowable to take this when they have gone out of sight.
Also it is allowable, when the two armies have gone away, to take a flag
that has been hoisted on a battlefield.



[18.] "*A robe from a shrine*" is an offering made by draping a
termite-mound \[in cloth\].



"*An ascetic's robe*" is one belonging to a bhikkhu.



"*One from a consecration*" is one thrown away at the king's
consecration place.



"*One produced by supernormal power*" is a "come-bhikkhu" robe.8 "*One
from a* *highway*" is one dropped in the middle of a road. But one
dropped by the owner's negligence should be taken only after waiting a
while.



"*One borne by the wind*" is one that falls a long way off, having been
carried by



the wind. It is allowable to take it if the owners are not in sight.



"*One presented by deities*" is one given by deities like that given to
the Elder



Anuruddha (Dhp-a II 173--74).



"*One from the sea*" is one washed up on dry land by the sea waves.



[19.]One given thus "We give it to the Order" or got by those
who go out for alms- cloth is not a refuse-rag. And in the case of one
presented by a bhikkhu, one given



7\. "The name of a street in Mahāgāma (S.E. Sri Lanka). Also in
Anurādhapura, they say" (Vism-mhṭ 77).\



8\. On certain occasions, when the going forth was given by the Buddha
with only the words, *"Ehi bhikkhu* (Come, bhikkhu)," owing to the
disciple's past merit robes appeared miraculously upon him (see e.g. Vin
Mahāvagga, Kh. 1).



[]



[]



after it has been got \[at a presentation of robes by householders\] at
the end of the Rains, or a "resting-place robe" \[that is, one
automatically supplied by a householder to the occupant of a certain
resting place\] is not a refuse-rag. It is a refuse-rag only when given
after not having been so obtained. And herein, that placed by the donors
at a bhikkhu's feet but given by that bhikkhu to the refuse-rag wearer
by placing it in his hand is called pure in one way. That given to a
bhikkhu by placing it in his hand but placed by him at the \[refuse-rag
wearer's\] feet is also pure in one way. That which is both placed at a
bhikkhu's feet and then given by him in the same way is pure in both
ways. \[64\] One obtained by being placed in the hand and \[given by
being\] placed in the hand too is not a strict man's robe. So a
refuse-rag wearer should use the robe after getting to know about the
kinds of refuse-rags. These are the *directions* for it in this
instance.



[20.]The *grades* are these. There are three kinds of
refuse-rag wearers: the strict, the medium, and the mild. Herein, one
who takes it only from a charnel ground is strict. One who takes one
left \[by someone, thinking\] "One gone forth will take it" is medium.
One who takes one given by being placed at his feet \[by a bhikkhu\] is
mild.



The moment anyone of these of his own choice or inclination agrees to
\[accept\] a robe given by a householder, his ascetic practice is
broken. This is the *breach* in this instance.



[21.]The *benefits* are these. He actually practices in
conformity with the dependence, because of the words "The going forth by
depending on the refuse-rag robe" (Vin I 58, 96); he is established in
the first of the Noble Ones' heritages (A II 27); there is no suffering
due to protecting; he exists independent of others; there is no fear of
robbers; there is no craving connected with use \[of robes\]; it is a
requisite suitable for an ascetic; it is a requisite recommended by the
Blessed One thus "valueless, easy to get, and blameless" (A II 26); it
inspires confidence; it produces the fruits of fewness of wishes, etc.;
the right way is cultivated; a good example is set9 to later
generations.



[22.] While striving for Death's army's rout The ascetic clad
in rag-robe clout\
Got from a rubbish heap, shines bright\
As mail-clad warrior in the fight.



This robe the world's great teacher wore,\
Leaving rare Kāsi cloth and more;\
Of rags from off a rubbish heap\
Who would not have a robe to keep?



Minding the words he did profess\
When he went into homelessness,\
Let him to wear such rags delight\
As one in seemly garb bedight.



This, firstly, is the commentary on the undertaking, directions, grades,
breach,



and benefits, in the case of the refuse-rag-wearer's practice.



9\. *Apādana---*"institution (or production)," not in PED.



[]



[]



[23.]ii. Next there is the *triple-robe-wearer's practice*.
This is undertaken with one of the following statements: "I refuse a
fourth robe" or "I undertake the triple- robe-wearer's practice." \[65\]



When a triple-robe wearer has got cloth for a robe, he can put it by for
as long as, owing to ill-health, he is unable to make it up, or for as
long as he does not find a helper, or lacks a needle, etc., and there is
no fault in his putting it by. But it is not allowed to put it by once
it has been dyed. That is called cheating the ascetic practice. These
are the *directions* for it.



[24.]This too has three *grades*. Herein, one who is strict
should, at the time of dyeing, first dye either the inner cloth or the
upper garment, and having dyed it, he should wear that round the waist
and dye the other. Then he can put that on over the shoulder and dye the
cloak of patches. But he is not allowed to wear the cloak of patches
round the waist. This is the duty when in an abode inside a village. But
it is allowable for him in the forest to wash and dye two together.
However, he should sit in a place near \[to the robes\] so that, if he
sees anyone, he can pull a yellow cloth over himself. But for the medium
one there is a yellow cloth in the dyeing room for use while dyeing, and
it is allowable for him to wear that \[as an inner cloth\] or to put it
on \[as an upper garment\] in order to do the work of dyeing. For the
mild one it is allowable to wear, or put on, the robes of bhikkhus who
are in communion (i.e. not suspended, etc.) in order to do the work of
dyeing. A bedspread that remains where it is10 is also allowable for
him, but he must not take it about him. And it is allowed for him to use
from time to time the robes of bhikkhus who are in communion. It is
allowed to one who wears the triple robe as an ascetic practice to have
a yellow shoulder-cloth too as a fourth; but it must be only a span wide
and three hands long.



The moment anyone of these three agrees to \[accept\] a fourth robe, his
ascetic



practice is broken. This is the *breach* in this instance.



[25.]The  *benefits* are these. The bhikkhu who is a
triple-robe wearer is content with the robe as a protection for the
body. Hence he goes taking it with him as a bird does its wings (M I
180); and such special qualities as having few undertakings, avoidance
of storage of cloth, a frugal existence, the abandoning of greed for
many robes, living in effacement by observing moderation even in what is
permitted, production of the fruits of fewness of wishes, etc., are
perfected. \[66\]



[26.] No risk of hoarding haunts the man of wit Who wants no
extra cloth for requisite;\
Using the triple robe where'er he goes\
The pleasant relish of content he knows.



10\. *Tatraṭṭhaka-paccattharaṇa---*"a bedspread that remains there"; "A
name for what has been determined upon as a bedspread in one's own
resting place or in someone else's. They say accordingly (it is said in
a commentary) that there is no breach of the ascetic practice even when
these two, that is, the bedspread and the undyed cloth, are kept as
extra robes" (Vism-mhṭ 78--79). For *tatraṭṭhaka* (fixture) see also
§61.



[]



[]



So, would the adept wander undeterred\
With naught else but his robes, as flies the bird\
With its own wings, then let him too rejoice\
That frugalness in garments be his choice.



This is the commentary on the undertaking, directions, grades, breach,
and



benefits, in the case of the triple-robe-wearer's practice.



[27.] iii. The  *alms-food-eater's practice* is *undertaken*
with one of the following statements: "I refuse a supplementary \[food\]
supply" or "I undertake the alms- food-eater's practice."



Now, this alms-food eater should not accept the following fourteen kinds
of meal: a meal offered to the Order, a meal offered to specified
bhikkhus, an invitation, a meal given by a ticket, one each half-moon
day, one each Uposatha day, one each first of the half-moon, a meal
given for visitors, a meal for travellers, a meal for the sick, a meal
for sick-nurses, a meal supplied to a \[particular\] residence, a meal
given in a principal house,11 a meal given in turn.



If, instead of saying "Take a meal given to the Order", \[meals\] are
given saying "The Order is taking alms in our house; you may take alms
too", it is allowable to consent. Tickets from the Order that are not
for actual food,12 and also a meal cooked in a monastery, are allowable
as well.



These are the *directions* for it.



[28.]This too has three *grades*. Herein, one who is strict
takes alms brought both from before and from behind, and he gives the
bowl to those who take it while he stands outside a door. He also takes
alms brought to the refectory and given there. But he does not take alms
by sitting \[and waiting for it to be brought later\] that day. The
medium one takes it as well by sitting \[and waiting for it to be
brought later\] that day; but he does not consent to \[its being
brought\] the next day. The mild one consents to alms \[being brought\]
on the next day and on the day after. Both these last miss the joy of an
independent life. There is, perhaps, a preaching on the Noble Ones'
heritages (A II 28) in some village. The strict one says to the others
"Let us go, friends, and listen to the Dhamma." One of them says, "I
have been made to sit \[and wait\] by a man, venerable sir," and the
other, "I have consented to \[receive\] alms tomorrow, venerable sir."
So they are both losers. The other wanders for alms in the morning and
then he goes and savours the taste of the Dhamma. \[67\]



The moment anyone of these three agrees to the extra gain consisting of
a meal given to the Order, etc., his ascetic practice is broken. This is
the *breach* in this instance.



[29.]The *benefits* are these. He actually practices in
conformity with the dependence because of the words "The going forth by
depending on the eating of lumps of



11\. "A meal to be given by setting it out in a principal house only."
(Vism-mhṭ 79) This meaning of *dhura-bhatta* not in PED.\



12\. "Tickets that are not for actual food, but deal with medicine,
etc." (Vism-mhṭ 79) *Paṭikkamana---"refectory"* (28) = *bojun hal*

alms food" (Vin II 58, 96); he is established in the second of the Noble
Ones' heritages; his existence is independent of others; it is a
requisite recommended by the Blessed One thus "Valueless, easy to get,
blameless" (A II 26); idleness is eliminated; livelihood is purified;
the practice of the minor training rule \[of the Pātimokkha\] is
fulfilled; he is not maintained by another; he helps others; pride is
abandoned; craving for tastes is checked; the training precepts about
eating as a group, substituting one meal \[invitation for another\] (see
Vinaya, Pācittiya 33 and Comy.), and good behaviour, are not
contravened; his life conforms to \[the principles of\] fewness of
wishes; he cultivates the right way; he has compassion for later
generations.



[30.] The monk content with alms for food Has independent
livelihood,\
And greed in him no footing finds;\
He is as free as the four winds.\
He never need be indolent,\
His livelihood is innocent,\
So let a wise man not disdain\
Alms-gathering for his domain.



Since it is said:



"If a bhikkhu can support himself on alms\
And live without another's maintenance,\
And pay no heed as well to gain and fame,\
The very gods indeed might envy him" (Ud 31).



This is the commentary on the undertaking, directions, grades, breach
and



benefits, in the case of the alms-food-eater's practice.



[31.]iv. The *house-to-house seeker's practice* is *undertaken*
with one of the following statements "I refuse a greedy alms round" or
"I undertake the house-to-house seeker's practice."



Now, the house-to-house seeker should stop at the village gate and make
sure that there is no danger. If there is danger in any street or
village, it is allowable to leave it out and wander for alms elsewhere.
When there is a house door or a street or a village where he
\[regularly\] gets nothing at all, he can go \[past it\] not counting it
as a village. But wherever he gets anything at all it is not allowed
\[subsequently\] to go \[past\] there and leave it out. This bhikkhu
should enter the village early so that he will be able to leave out any
inconvenient place and go elsewhere. \[68\] But if people who are giving
a gift \[of a meal\] in a monastery or who are coming along the road
take his bowl and give alms food, it is allowable. And as this
\[bhikkhu\] is going along the road, he should, when it is the time,
wander for alms in any village he comes to and not pass it by. If he
gets nothing there or only a little, he should wander for alms in the
next village in order. These are the *directions* for it.



[32.]This too has three *grades*. Herein, one who is strict
does not take alms brought from before or brought from behind or brought
to the refectory and given there. He hands over his bowl at a door,
however; for in this ascetic practice there is none equal to the Elder
Mahā Kassapa, yet an instance in which even he handed over his



[]



[]



bowl is mentioned (see Ud 29). The medium one takes what is brought from
before and from behind and what is brought to the refectory, and he
hands over his bowl at a door. But he does not sit waiting for alms.
Thus he conforms to the rule of the strict alms-food eater. The mild one
sits waiting \[for alms to be brought\] that day.



The ascetic practice of these three is broken as soon as the greedy alms
round starts \[by going only to the houses where good alms food is
given\]. This is the *breach* in this instance.



[33.]The *benefits* are these. He is always a stranger among
families and is like the moon (S II 197); he abandons avarice about
families; he is compassionate impartially; he avoids the dangers in
being supported by a family; he does not delight in invitations; he does
not hope for \[meals\] to be brought; his life conforms to \[the
principles of\] fewness of wishes, and so on.



[34.] The monk who at each house his begging plies Is moonlike,
ever new to families,\
Nor does he grudge to help all equally,\
Free from the risks of house-dependency.\
Who would the self-indulgent round forsake\
And roam the world at will, the while to make\
His downcast eyes range a yoke-length before,\
Then let him wisely seek from door to door.



This is the commentary on the undertaking, directions, grades, breach,
and



benefits, in the case of the house-to-house-seeker's practice. \[69\]



[35.]v. The *one-sessioner's practice* is *undertaken* with one
of the following statements: "I refuse eating in several sessions" or "I
undertake the one-sessioner's practice."



When the one-sessioner sits down in the sitting hall, instead of sitting
on an elder's seat, he should notice which seat is likely to fall to him
and sit down on that. If his teacher or preceptor arrives while the meal
is still unfinished, it is allowable for him to get up and do the
duties. But the Elder Tipiṭaka Cūla-Abhaya said: "He should either keep
his seat \[and finish his meal\] or \[if he gets up he should leave the
rest of\] his meal \[in order not to break the ascetic practice\]. And
this is one whose meal is still unfinished; therefore let him do the
duties, but in that case let him not eat the \[rest of the\] meal."
These are the *directions*.



[36.]This too has three *grades*. Herein, one who is strict may
not take anything more than the food that he has laid his hand on
whether it is little or much. And if people bring him ghee, etc.,
thinking "The elder has eaten nothing," while these are allowable for
the purpose of medicine, they are not so for the purpose of food. The
medium one may take more as long as the meal in the bowl is not
exhausted; for he is called "one who stops when the food is finished."
The mild one may eat as long as he does not get up from his seat. He is
either "one who stops with the water" because he eats until he takes
\[water for\] washing the bowl, or "one who stops with the session"
because he eats until he gets up.



The ascetic practice of these three is broken at the moment when food
has been



eaten at more than one session. This is the breach in this instance.



[]



[]



[37.]The *benefits* are these. He has little affliction and
little sickness; he has lightness, strength, and a happy life; there is
no contravening \[rules\] about food that is not what is left over from
a meal; craving for tastes is eliminated; his life conforms to the
\[principles of\] fewness of wishes, and so on.



[38.] No illness due to eating shall he feel Who gladly in one
session takes his meal;\
No longing to indulge his sense of taste\
Tempts him to leave his work to go to waste.\
His own true happiness a monk may find\
In eating in one session, pure in mind.\
Purity and effacement wait on this;\
For it gives reason to abide in bliss.



This is the commentary on the undertaking, directions, grades, breach,
and



benefits, in the case of the one-sessioner's practice. \[70\]



[39.]vi. The *bowl-food-eater's practice* is *undertaken* with
one of the following statements: "I refuse a second vessel" or "I
undertake the bowl-food-eater's practice."



When at the time of drinking rice gruel, the bowl-food eater gets curry
that is put in a dish; he can first either eat the curry or drink the
rice gruel. If he puts it in the rice gruel, the rice gruel becomes
repulsive when a curry made with cured fish, etc., is put into it. So it
is allowable \[to do this\] only in order to use it without making it
repulsive. Consequently this is said with reference to such curry as
that. But what is unrepulsive, such as honey, sugar,13 etc., should be
put into it. And in taking it he should take the right amount. It is
allowable to take green vegetables with the hand and eat them. But
unless he does that they should be put into the bowl. Because a second
vessel has been refused it is not allowable \[to use\] anything else,
not even the leaf of a tree. These are its *directions*.



[40.]This too has three *grades*. Herein, for one who is
strict, except at the time of eating sugarcane, it is not allowed
\[while eating\] to throw rubbish away, and it is not allowed while
eating to break up rice-lumps, fish, meat and cakes. \[The rubbish
should be thrown away and the rice-lumps, etc., broken up before
starting to eat.\] The medium one is allowed to break them up with one
hand while eating; and he is called a "hand ascetic." The mild one is
called a "bowl ascetic"; anything that can be put into his bowl he is
allowed, while eating, to break up, \[that is, rice lumps, etc.,\] with
his hand or \[such things as palm sugar, ginger, etc.,\] with his teeth.



The moment anyone of these three agrees to a second vessel his ascetic
practice



is broken. This is the *breach* in this instance.



[41.]The *benefits* are these. Craving for variety of tastes is
eliminated; excessiveness of wishes is abandoned; he sees the purpose
and the \[right\] amount in nutriment; he is not bothered with carrying
saucers, etc., about; his life conforms to \[the principles of\] fewness
of wishes and so on.



[42.] He baffles doubts that might arise With extra dishes;
downcast eyes



13\. *Sakkarā---*"sugar": spelt *sakkharā* in PED.



[]



[]



The true devotedness imply14\
Of one uprooting gluttony.\
Wearing content as if 'twere part\
Of his own nature, glad at heart;\
None but a bowl-food eater may\
Consume his food in such a way.



This is the commentary on the undertaking, directions, grades, breach,
and



benefits, in the case of the bowl-food-eater's practice. \[71\]



[43.]vii. The  *later-food-refuser's practice* is *undertaken*
with one of the following statements: "I refuse additional food" or "I
undertake the later-food-refuser's practice."



Now, when that later-food refuser has shown that he is satisfied, he
should not again have the food made allowable \[by having it put into
his hands according to the rule for bhikkhus\] and eat it. These are the
*directions* for it.



[44.]This too has three *grades*. Herein, there is no showing
that he has had enough with respect to the first lump, but there is when
he refuses more while that is being swallowed. So when one who is strict
has thus shown that he has had enough \[with respect to the second
lump\], he does not eat the second lump after swallowing the first. The
medium one eats also that food with respect to which he has shown that
he has had enough. But the mild one goes on eating until he gets up from
his seat.



The moment any one of these three has eaten what has been made allowable
\[again\] after he has shown that he has had enough, his ascetic
practice is broken. This is the *breach* in this instance.



[45.]The *benefits* are these. One is far from committing an
offence concerned with extra food; there is no overloading of the
stomach; there is no keeping food back; there is no renewed search \[for
food\]; he lives in conformity with \[the principles of\] fewness of
wishes, and so on.



[46.] When a wise man refuses later food He needs no extra
search in weary mood,\
Nor stores up food till later in the day,\
Nor overloads his stomach in this way.\
So, would the adept from such faults abstain,\
Let him assume this practice for his gain,\
Praised by the Blessed One, which will augment\
The special qualities such as content.



This is the commentary on the undertaking, directions, grades, breach,
and



benefits, in the case of the later-food-refuser's practice.



[47.] viii. The  *forest-dweller's practice* is *undertaken*
with one of the following statements: "I refuse an abode in a village"
or "I undertake the forest-dweller's practice."



14\. *Subbata---*"truly devoted": fm. *su* + *vata* (having good vows).
See also §59*.*



[]



[]



[48.]Now, that forest dweller must leave an abode in a village
in order to meet the dawn in the forest. Herein, a village abode is the
village itself with its precincts. A "village" may consist of one
cottage or several cottages, it may be enclosed by a wall or not, have
human inhabitants or not, and it can also be a caravan that is inhabited
for more than four months. \[72\] The "village precincts" cover the
range of a stone thrown by a man of medium stature standing between the
gate-posts of a walled village, if there are two gate-posts, as at
Anurādhapura (cf. Vin III 46). The Vinaya experts say that this
\[stone's throw\] is characterized as up to the place where a thrown
stone falls, as, for instance, when young men exercise their arms and
throw stones in order to show off their strength. But the Suttanta
experts say that it is up to where one thrown to scare crows normally
falls. In the case of an unwalled village, the house precinct is where
the water falls when a woman standing in the door of the outermost house
of all throws water from a basin. Within a stone's throw of the kind
already described from that point is the village. Within a second
stone's throw is the village precinct.



[49.]"Forest," according to the Vinaya method firstly, is
described thus: "Except the village and its precincts, all is forest"
(Vin III 46). According to the Abhidhamma method it is described thus:
"Having gone out beyond the boundary post, all that is forest" (Vibh
251; Paṭis I 176). But according to the Suttanta method its
characteristic is this: "A forest abode is five hundred bow-lengths
distant" (Vin IV 183). That should be defined by measuring it with a
strung instructor's bow from the gate-post of a walled village, or from
the range of the first stone's throw from an unwalled one, up to the
monastery wall.



[50.]But if the monastery is not walled, it is said in the
Vinaya commentaries, it should be measured by making the first dwelling
of all the limit, or else the refectory or regular meeting place or
Bodhi Tree or shrine, even if that is far from a dwelling \[belonging to
the monastery\]. But in the Majjhima commentary it is said that,
omitting the precincts of the monastery and the village, the distance to
be measured is that between where the two stones fall. This is the
measure here.



[51.]Even if the village is close by and the sounds of men are
audible to people in the monastery, still if it is not possible to go
straight to it because of rocks, rivers, etc., in between, the five
hundred bow-lengths can be reckoned by that road even if one has to go
by boat. But anyone who blocks the path to the village here and there
for the purpose of \[lengthening it so as to be able to say that he is\]
taking up the practice is cheating the ascetic practice.



[52.]If a forest-dwelling bhikkhu's preceptor or teacher is ill
and does not get what he needs in the forest, \[73\] he should take him
to a village abode and attend him there. But he should leave in time to
meet the dawn in a place proper for the practice. If the affliction
increases towards the time of dawn, he must attend him and not bother
about the purity of his ascetic practice. These are the *directions*.



[53.]This too has three *grades*. Herein, one who is strict
must always meet the dawn in the forest. The medium one is allowed to
live in a village for the four months of the Rains. And the mild one,
for the winter months too.



[]



[]



If in the period defined any one of these three goes from the forest and
hears the Dhamma in a village abode, his ascetic practice is not broken
if he meets the dawn there, nor is it broken if he meets it as he is on
his way back after hearing \[the Dhamma\]. But if, when the preacher has
got up, he thinks "We shall go after lying down awhile" and he meets the
dawn while asleep or if of his own choice he meets the dawn while in a
village abode, then his ascetic practice is broken. This is the *breach*
in this instance.



[54.]The *benefits* are these. A forest-dwelling bhikkhu who
has given attention to the perception of forest (see MN 121) can obtain
hitherto unobtained concentration, or preserve that already obtained.
And the Master is pleased with him, according as it is said: "So,
Nāgita, I am pleased with that bhikkhu's dwelling in the forest" (A III
343). And when he lives in a remote abode his mind is not distracted by
unsuitable visible objects, and so on. He is free from anxiety; he
abandons attachment to life; he enjoys the taste of the bliss of
seclusion, and the state of the refuse-rag wearer, etc., becomes him.



[55.] He lives secluded and apart,\
Remote abodes delight his heart;\
The Saviour of the world, besides,\
He gladdens that in groves abides.



The hermit that in woods can dwell\
Alone, may gain the bliss as well\
Whose savour is beyond the price\
Of royal bliss in paradise.



Wearing the robe of rags he may\
Go forth into the forest fray;\
Such is his mail, for weapons too\
The other practices will do.



One so equipped can be assured\
Of routing Māra and his horde.\
So let the forest glades delight\
A wise man for his dwelling's site.



This is the commentary on the undertaking, directions, grades, breach,
and



benefits, in the case of the forest-dweller's practice. \[74\]



[56.] ix. The  *tree-root-dweller's practice* is *undertaken*
with one of the following



statements: "I refuse a roof" or "I undertake the tree-root-dweller's
practice."



The tree-root dweller should avoid such trees as a tree near a frontier,
a shrine tree, a gum tree, a fruit tree, a bats' tree, a hollow tree, or
a tree standing in the middle of a monastery. He can choose a tree
standing on the outskirts of a monastery. These are the *directions*.



[57.]This has three *grades* too. Herein, one who is strict is
not allowed to have a tree that he has chosen tidied up. He can move the
fallen leaves with his foot while dwelling there. The medium one is
allowed to get it tidied up by those who happen to come along. The mild
one can take up residence there after summoning



[]



[]



monastery attendants and novices and getting them to clear it up, level
it, strew sand and make a fence round with a gate fixed in it. On a
special day, a tree-root dweller should sit in some concealed place
elsewhere rather than there.



The moment any one of these three makes his abode under a roof, his
ascetic practice is broken. The reciters of the Aṅguttara say that it is
broken as soon as he knowingly meets the dawn under a roof. This is the
breach in this instance.



[58.]The *benefits* are these. He practices in conformity with
the dependence, because of the words "The going forth by depending on
the root of a tree as an abode" (Vin I 58, 96); it is a requisite
recommended by the Blessed One thus "Valueless, easy to get, and
blameless" (A II 26); perception of impermanence is aroused through
seeing the continual alteration of young leaves; avarice about abodes
and love of \[building\] work are absent; he dwells in the company of
deities; he lives in conformity with \[the principles of\] fewness of
wishes, and so on.



[59.] The Blessed One praised roots of trees As one of the
dependencies (Vin I 58);\
Can he that loves secludedness\
Find such another dwelling place?



Secluded at the roots of trees\
And guarded well by deities\
He lives in true devotedness\
Nor covets any dwelling place. \[75\]



And when the tender leaves are seen\
Bright red at first, then turning green,\
And then to yellow as they fall,\
He sheds belief once and for all



In permanence. Tree roots have been\
Bequeathed by him; secluded scene\
No wise man will disdain at all\
For contemplating \[rise and fall\].



This is the commentary on the undertaking, directions, grades, breach,
and



benefits, in the case of the tree-root-dweller's practice.



[60.] x. The  *open-air-dweller's practice* is *undertaken*
with one of the following statements: "I refuse a roof and a tree root"
or "I undertake the open-air-dweller's practice."



An open-air dweller is allowed to enter the Uposatha-house for the
purpose of hearing the Dhamma or for the purpose of the Uposatha. If it
rains while he is inside, he can go out when the rain is over instead of
going out while it is still raining. He is allowed to enter the eating
hall or the fire room in order to do the duties, or to go under a roof
in order to ask elder bhikkhus in the eating hall about a meal, or when
teaching and taking lessons, or to take beds, chairs, etc., inside that
have been wrongly left outside. If he is going along a road with a
requisite belonging to a senior and it rains, he is allowed to go into a
wayside rest house. If he has nothing with him, he is not allowed to
hurry in order to get to a rest house;



[]



[]



but he can go at his normal pace and enter it and stay there as long as
it rains. These are the *directions* for it. And the same rule applies
to the tree-root dweller too.



[61.]This has three *grades* too. Herein, one who is strict is
not allowed to live near a tree or a rock or a house. He should make a
robe-tent right out in the open and live in that. The medium one is
allowed to live near a tree or a rock or a house so long as he is not
covered by them. The mild one is allowed these: a \[rock\] overhang
without a drip-ledge cut in it,15 a hut of branches, cloth stiffened
with paste, and a tent treated as a fixture, that has been left by field
watchers, and so on.



The moment any one of these three goes under a roof or to a tree root to
dwell there, \[76\] his ascetic practice is broken. The reciters of the
Aṅguttara say that it is broken as soon as he knowingly meets the dawn
there. This is the breach in this case.



[62.]The benefits are these: the impediment of dwellings is
severed; stiffness and torpor are expelled; his conduct deserves the
praise "Like deer the bhikkhus live unattached and homeless" (S I 199);
he is detached; he is \[free to go in\] any direction; he lives in
conformity with \[the principles of\] fewness of wishes, and so on.



[63.] The open air provides a life\
That aids the homeless bhikkhu's strife,\
Easy to get, and leaves his mind\
Alert as a deer, so he shall find



Stiffness and torpor brought to halt.\
Under the star-bejewelled vault\
The moon and sun furnish his light,\
And concentration his delight.\
The joy seclusion's savour gives\
He shall discover soon who lives\
In open air; and that is why\
The wise prefer the open sky.



This is the commentary on the undertaking, directions, grades, breach,
and



benefits, in the case of the open-air-dweller's practice.



[64.]xi. The *charnel-ground-dweller's practice* is
*undertaken* with one of the following statements: "I refuse what is not
a charnel ground" or "I undertake the charnel- ground-dweller's
practice."



15\. Reading  *acchinna-mariyādaṃ * with Vism-mhṭ, which says:
*"'Without a drip-ledge cut (acchinna-mariyādaṃ)'* means without a
drip-ledge *(mariyāda)* made above, which might come under the heading
of a drip-ledge *(mariyāda-saṅkhepena)* made to prevent rain water from
coming in. But if the rain water comes under the overhang *(pabbhāra)*
and is allowed to go in under it, then this comes under the heading of
the open air *(abbhokāsika-saṅkhepa)"* (Vism-mhṭ 84). This seems to
refer to the widespread habit in ancient Sri Lanka of cutting a
drip-ledge on overhanging rocks used for bhikkhus' dwellings so that the
rain that falls on top of the rock drips down in front of the space
under the overhang instead of trickling down under the rock and wetting
the back and floor. *Pabbhāra* in this context is "over hang" rather
than "slope."



[]



[]



Now, the charnel-ground dweller should not live in some place just
because the people who built the village have called it "the charnel
ground" for it is not a charnel ground unless a dead body has been burnt
on it. But as soon as one has been burnt on it, it becomes a charnel
ground. And even if it has been neglected for a dozen years, it is so
still.



[65.] One who dwells there should not be the sort of person who
gets walks, pavilions, etc., built, has beds and chairs set out and
drinking and washing water kept ready, and preaches Dhamma; for this
ascetic practice is a momentous thing. Whoever goes to live there should
be diligent. And he should first inform the senior elder of the Order or
the king's local representative in order to prevent trouble. When he
walks up and down, he should do so looking at the pyre with half an eye.
\[77\] On his way to the charnel ground he should avoid the main roads
and take a by-path. He should define all the objects \[there\] while it
is day, so that they will not assume frightening shapes for him at
night. Even if non-human beings wander about screeching, he must not hit
them with anything. It is not allowed to miss going to the charnel
ground even for a single day. The reciters of the Aṅguttara say that
after spending the middle watch in the charnel ground he is allowed to
leave in the last watch. He should not take such foods as sesame flour,
pease pudding, fish, meat, milk, oil, sugar, etc., which are liked by
non-human beings. He should not enter the homes of families.16 These are
the *directions* for it.



[66.]This has three *grades* too. Herein, one who is strict
should live where there are always burnings and corpses and mourning.
The medium one is allowed to live where there is one of these three. The
mild one is allowed to live in a place that possesses the bare
characteristics of a charnel ground already stated.



When any one of these three makes his abode in some place not a charnel
ground, his ascetic practice is broken. It is on the day on which he
does not go to the charnel ground, the Aṅguttara reciters say. This is
the *breach* in this case.



[67.]The *benefits* are these. He acquires mindfulness of
death; he lives diligently; the sign of foulness is available (see Ch.
VI); greed for sense desires is removed; he constantly sees the body's
true nature; he has a great sense of urgency; he abandons vanity of
health, etc.; he vanquishes fear and dread (MN 4); non-human beings
respect and honour him; he lives in conformity with \[the principles
of\] fewness of wishes, and so on.



[68.] Even in sleep the dweller in a charnel ground shows
naught Of negligence, for death is ever present to his thought;\
He may be sure there is no lust after sense pleasure preys Upon his
mind, with many corpses present to his gaze.



Rightly he strives because he gains a sense of urgency,\
While in his search for final peace he curbs all vanity.\
Let him that feels a leaning to Nibbāna in his heart\
Embrace this practice for it has rare virtues to impart.



16\. "He should not go into families' houses because he smells of the
dead and is followed by *pisāca* goblins" (Vism-mhṭ 84).



[]



[]



This is the commentary on the undertaking, directions, grades, breach,
and



benefits, in the case of the charnel-ground dweller's practice. \[78\]



[69.] xii. The  *any-bed-user's practice* is *undertaken* with
one of the following statements: "I refuse greed for resting places" or
"I undertake the any-bed-user's practice."



The any-bed user should be content with whatever resting place he gets
thus: "This falls to your lot." He must not make anyone else shift
\[from his bed\]. These are the *directions*.



[70.]This has three *grades* too. Herein, one who is strict is
not allowed to ask about the resting place that has fallen to his lot:
"Is it far?" or "Is it too near?" or "Is it infested by non-human
beings, snakes, and so on?" or "Is it hot?" or "Is it cold?". The medium
one is allowed to ask, but not to go and inspect it. The mild one is
allowed to inspect it and, if he does not like it, to choose another.



As soon as greed for resting places arises in any one of these three,
his ascetic



practice is broken. This is the *breach* in this instance.



[71.]The *benefits* are these. The advice "He should be content
with what he gets" (J-a I 476; Vin IV 259) is carried out; he regards
the welfare of his fellows in the life of purity; he gives up caring
about inferiority and superiority; approval and disapproval are
abandoned; the door is closed against excessive wishes; he lives in
conformity with \[the principles\] of fewness of wishes, and so on.



[72.] One vowed to any bed will be\
Content with what he gets, and he\
Can sleep in bliss without dismay\
On nothing but a spread of hay.



He is not eager for the best,\
No lowly couch does he detest,\
He aids his young companions too\
That to the monk's good life are new.



So for a wise man to delight\
In any kind of bed is right;\
A Noble One this custom loves\
As one the sages' Lord approves.



This is the commentary on the undertaking, directions, grades, breach,
and



benefits, in the case of the any-bed-user's practice.



[73.]xiii. The *sitter's practice* is *undertaken* with one of
the following statements: "I refuse lying down" or "I undertake the
sitter's practice."



The sitter can get up in any one of three watches of the night and walk
up and



down: for lying down is the only posture not allowed. These are the
*directions*. \[79\]



[74.]This has three *grades* too. Herein, one who is strict is
not allowed a back-rest or cloth band or binding-strap \[to prevent
falling while asleep\].17 The medium one



17\. *Āyogapatta---*"a binding-strap": this is probably the meaning. But
cf. Vin II 135 and Vin-a 891.



[]



[]



is allowed any one of these three. The mild one is allowed a back-rest,
a cloth band, a binding-strap, a cushion, a "five-limb" and a
"seven-limb." A "five-limb" is \[a chair\] made with \[four legs and\] a
support for the back. A "seven-limb" is one made with \[four legs,\] a
support for the back and an \[arm\] support on each side. They made
that, it seems, for the Elder Pīṭhābhaya (Abhaya of the Chair). The
elder became a non-returner, and then attained Nibbāna.



As soon as any one of these three lies down, his ascetic practice is
broken. This



is the *breach* in this instance.



[75.]The *benefits* are these. The mental shackle described
thus, "He dwells indulging in the pleasure of lying prone, the pleasure
of lolling, the pleasure of torpor" (M I 102), is severed; his state is
suitable for devotion to any meditation subject; his deportment inspires
confidence; his state favours the application of energy; he develops the
right practice.



[76.] The adept that can place crosswise His feet to rest upon
his thighs\
And sit with back erect shall make\
Foul Māra's evil heart to quake.\
No more in supine joys to plump\
And wallow in lethargic dump;\
Who sits for rest and finds it good\
Shines forth in the Ascetics' Wood.



The happiness and bliss it brings\
Has naught to do with worldly things;\
So must the sitter's vow befit\
The manners of a man of wit.



This is the commentary on the undertaking, directions, grades, breach,
and



benefits, in the case of the sitter's practice.



[77.] Now, there is the commentary according to the stanza:



\(4\) As to the profitable triad,\
(5) "Ascetic" and so on distinguished,\
(6) As to groups, and also (7) singly,\
The exposition should be known (see §3).



[78.] *4.* Herein, as to the *profitable triad*: (Dhs, p.1) all
the ascetic practices, that is to say, those of trainers, ordinary men,
and men whose cankers have been destroyed, may be either profitable or
\[in the Arahant's case\] indeterminate. \[80\] No ascetic practice is
unprofitable.



But if someone should say: There is also an unprofitable ascetic
practice because of the words "One of evil wishes, a prey to wishes,
becomes a forest dweller" (A III 219), etc., he should be told: We have
not said that he does not live in the forest with unprofitable
consciousness. Whoever has his dwelling in the forest is a forest
dweller; and he may be one of evil wishes or of few wishes. But, as it
was said above (§11), they "are the practices (*aṅga*) of a bhikkhu who
is ascetic (*dhuta*) because he has shaken off (*dhuta*) defilement by
undertaking one or other of them. Or the



[]



[]



knowledge that has got the name "ascetic" (*dhuta*) because it shakes
off (*dhunana*) defilement is a practice (*aṅga*) belonging to these,
thus they are "ascetic practices" (*dhutaṅga*). Or alternatively, they
are ascetic (*dhuta*) because they shake off (*niddhunana*) opposition,
and they are practices (*aṅga*) because they are a way (*paṭipatti*)."
Now, no one called "ascetic" on account of what is unprofitable could
have these as his practices; nor does what is unprofitable shake off
anything so that those things to which it belonged as a practice could
be called "ascetic practices." And what is unprofitable does not both
shake off cupidity for robes, etc., and become the practice of the way.
Consequently it was rightly said that no ascetic practice is
unprofitable.



[79.]And those who hold that an ascetic practice is outside the
profitable triad18 have no ascetic practice as regards meaning. Owing to
the shaking off of what is non-existent could it be called an ascetic
practice? Also there are the words "Proceeded to undertake the ascetic
qualities" (Vin III 15), and it follows19 that those words are
contradicted. So that should not be accepted.



This, in the first place, is the commentary on the profitable triad.



[80.] *5. As to*  "*ascetic and so on distinguished*," the
following things should be understood, that is to say, ascetic, a
preacher of asceticism, ascetic states, ascetic practices, and for whom
the cultivation of ascetic practices is suitable.



[81.] Herein, *ascetic* means either a person whose defilements
are shaken off, or a



state that entails shaking off defilements.



A *preacher of asceticism*: one is ascetic but not a preacher of
asceticism, another is not ascetic but a preacher of asceticism, another
is neither ascetic nor a preacher of asceticism, and another is both
ascetic and a preacher of asceticism.



[82.]Herein, one who has shaken off his defilements with an
ascetic practice but does not advise and instruct another in an ascetic
practice, like the Elder Bakkula, is "ascetic but not a preacher of
asceticism," according as it is said: "Now, the venerable Bakkula was
ascetic but not a preacher of asceticism."



One who \[81\] has not shaken off his own defilements but only advises
and instructs another in an ascetic practice, like the Elder Upananda,
is "not ascetic but a preacher of asceticism," according as it is said:
"Now, the venerable Upananda son of the Sakyans was not ascetic but a
preacher of asceticism."



One who has failed in both, like Lāḷudāyin, is "neither ascetic nor a
preacher of asceticism," according as it is said: "Now, the venerable
Lāḷudāyin was neither ascetic nor a preacher of asceticism."



18\. For the triads of the *Abhidhamma Mātikā* (Abhidhamma Schedule) see
Ch. XIII, n.20. *"'Those who hold':* a reference to the inhabitants of
the Abhayagiri Monastery at Anurādhapura. For they say that ascetic
practice is a concept consisting in a name *(nāma-paññatti).* That being
so, they could have no meaning of shaking off defilements, or
possibility of being undertaken, because in the ultimate sense they
would be non- existent \[concepts having no existence\]" (Vism-mhṭ 87).
Cf. IV.29.



19\. *Āpajjati* (and its noun *āpatti)* is the normal word used for
undesirable consequences that follow on some unsound logical
proposition. See XVI.68f. This meaning is not in PED.



[]



[]



One who has succeeded in both, like the General of the Dhamma, is "both
ascetic and a preacher of asceticism," according as it is said: "Now,
the venerable Sāriputta was ascetic and a preacher of asceticism."



[83.]*Ascetic states*: the five states that go with the
volition of an ascetic practice, that is to say, fewness of wishes,
contentment, effacement, seclusion, and that specific quality20 are
called "ascetic states' because of the words "Depending on fewness of
wishes" (A III 219), and so on.



[84.] Herein,  *fewness of wishes* and *contentment* are
non-greed. *Effacement* and *seclusion* belong to the two states,
non-greed and non-delusion. *That specific quality* is knowledge.
Herein, by means of non-greed a man shakes off greed for things that are
forbidden. By means of non-delusion he shakes off the delusion that
hides the dangers in those same things. And by means of non-greed he
shakes off indulgence in pleasure due to sense desires that occurs under
the heading of using what is allowed. And by means of non-delusion he
shakes off indulgence in self- mortification that occurs under the
heading of excessive effacement in the ascetic practices. That is why
these states should be understood as "ascetic states."



[85.]*Ascetic practices*: these should be understood as the
thirteen, that is to say, the refuse-rag-wearer's practice *...* the
sitter's practice, which have already been described as to meaning and
as to characteristic, and so forth.



[86.]*For whom the cultivation of ascetic practices is
suitable*: \[they are suitable\] for one of greedy temperament and for
one of deluded temperament. Why? Because the cultivation of ascetic
practices is both a difficult progress21 and an abiding in effacement;
and greed subsides with the difficult progress, while delusion is got
rid of in those diligent by effacement. Or the cultivation of the
forest-dweller's practice and the tree-root-dweller's practice here are
suitable for one of hating temperament; for hate too subsides in one who
dwells there without coming into conflict.



This is the commentary "as to 'ascetic' and so on distinguished." \[82\]



[87.]*6. and 7. As to groups and also singly*. Now, *6*. *as to
groups*: these ascetic practices are in fact only eight, that is to say,
three principal and five individual practices. Herein, the three,
namely, the house-to-house-seeker's practice, the one-sessioner's
practice, and the open-air-dweller's practice, are principal practices.
For one who keeps the house-to-house-seeker's practice will keep the
alms-food-eater's practice; and the bowl-food-eater's practice and the
later-food-refuser's practice will be well kept by one who keeps the
one-sessioner's practice. And what need has one who keeps the
open-air-dweller's practice to keep the tree-root-dweller's practice or
the any-bed-user's practice? So there are these three principal
practices that,



20\. *Idamatthitā---*"that specific quality": "Owing to these profitable
states it exists, (thus it is 'specific by those'; *imehi kusaladhammehi
atthi* = *idam-atthi).* The knowledge by means\
of which one who has gone forth should be established in the
refuse-rag-wearer's practice, etc., and by means of which, on being so
instructed one undertakes and persists in the ascetic qualities---that
knowledge is *idamatthitā*" (Vism-mhṭ 88).



21\. See XXI.117.



[]



[]



together with the five individual practices, that is to say, the
forest-dweller's practice, the refuse-rag-wearer's practice, the
triple-robe-wearer's practice, the sitter's practice, and the
charnel-ground-dweller's practice, come to eight only.



[88.]Again they come to four, that is to say, two connected
with robes, five connected with alms food, five connected with the
resting place, and one connected with energy. Herein, it is the sitter's
practice that is connected with energy; the rest are obvious.



Again they all amount to two only, since twelve are dependent on
requisites and one on energy. Also they are two according to what is and
what is not to be cultivated. For when one cultivating an ascetic
practice finds that his meditation subject improves, he should cultivate
it; but when he is cultivating one and finds that his meditation subject
deteriorates, he should not cultivate it. But when he finds that,
whether he cultivates one or not, his meditation subject only improves
and does not deteriorate, he should cultivate them out of compassion for
later generations. And when he finds that, whether he cultivates them or
not, his meditation subject does not improve, he should still cultivate
them for the sake of acquiring the habit for the future. So they are of
two kinds as what is and what is not to be cultivated.



[89.]And all are of one kind as volition. For there is only one
ascetic practice, namely, that consisting in the volition of
undertaking. Also it is said in the Commentary: "It is the volition that
is the ascetic practice, they say."



[90.]*7. Singly*: with thirteen for bhikkhus, eight for
bhikkhunīs, twelve for novices, seven for female probationers and female
novices, and two for male and female lay followers, there are thus
forty-two.



[91.]If there is a charnel ground in the open that complies
with the forest-dweller's practice, one bhikkhu is able to put all the
ascetic practices into effect simultaneously.



But the two, namely, the forest-dweller's practice and the
later-food-refuser's practice, are forbidden to bhikkhunīs by training
precept. \[83\] And it is hard for them to observe the three, namely,
the open-air-dweller's practice, the tree-root- dweller's practice, and
the charnel-ground-dweller's practice, because a bhikkhunī is not
allowed to live without a companion, and it is hard to find a female
companion with like desire for such a place, and even if available, she
would not escape having to live in company. This being so, the purpose
of cultivating the ascetic practice would scarcely be served. It is
because they are reduced by five owing to this inability to make use of
certain of them that they are to be understood as eight only for
bhikkhunīs.



[92.]Except for the triple-robe-wearer's practice all the other
twelve as stated should be understood to be for novices, and all the
other seven for female probationers and female novices.



The two, namely, the one-sessioner's practice and the bowl-food-eater's
practice, are proper for male and female lay followers to employ. In
this way there are two ascetic practices.



This is the commentary "as to groups and also singly."



[]



[]



[93.]And this is the end of the treatise on the ascetic
practices to be undertaken for the purpose of perfecting those special
qualities of fewness of wishes, contentment, etc., by means of which
there comes about the cleansing of virtue as described in the  *Path of
Purification*, which is shown under the three headings of virtue,
concentration, and understanding, contained in the stanza, "When a wise
man, established well in virtue" (I.1).



The second chapter called "The Description of the Ascetic Practices" in
the *Path of Purification* composed for the purpose of gladdening good
people.

Part II



Concentration (*Samādhi*)



[]







## CHAPTER III 


TAKING A MEDITATION SUBJECT



(*Kammaṭṭhāna-gahaṇa-niddesa*)



[1.]\[84\] Now, concentration is described under the heading of
"consciousness" in the phrase "develops consciousness and understanding"
(I.1). It should be developed by one who has taken his stand on virtue
that has been purified by means of the special qualities of fewness of
wishes, etc., and perfected by observance of the ascetic practices. But
that concentration has been shown only very briefly and so it is not
even easy to understand, much less to develop. There is therefore the
following set of questions, the purpose of which is to show the method
of its development in detail:



[(i)] What is concentration?



[(ii)] In what sense is it concentration?



[(iii)] What are its characteristic, function, manifestation,
and proximate



cause?



[(iv)] How many kinds of concentration are there?



[(v)] What is its defilement?



[(vi)] What is its cleansing?



[(vii)] How should it be developed?



[(viii)] What are the benefits of the development of
concentration?1



[2.]Here are the answers:



[(i)] *WHAT  IS  CONCENTRATION?* Concentration is of many sorts
and has various aspects. An answer that attempted to cover it all would
accomplish neither its intention nor its purpose and would, besides,
lead to distraction; so we shall confine ourselves to the kind intended
here, calling concentration profitable unification of mind.2



1\. The answer to question (vii) stretches from III.27 to XI.119. That
to question (viii) from XI. 120 up to the end of Ch. XIII.\



2\. *"Cittass' ekaggatā*"* * is rendered here as "unification of mind"
in the sense of agreement or harmony (cf. *samagga)* of consciousness
and its concomitants in focusing on a single object (see A I 70). It is
sometimes rendered "one-pointedness" in that sense, or in the sense of
the focusing of a searchlight. It may be concluded that this term is
simply a synonym for *samādhi* and nothing more, firstly from its use in
the suttas, and secondly from the fact that it is given no separate
definition in the description of the formations aggregate in Ch. XIV.
Cf. gloss at M-a I 124.


[]



[]



[3.](ii) *IN WHAT SENSE IS IT CONCENTRATION?* It is
concentration (*samādhi*) in the sense of concentrating (*samādhāna*).
What is this concentrating? It is the centring (*ādhāna*) of
consciousness and consciousness-concomitants evenly (*samaṃ*) and
rightly (*sammā*) on a single object; placing, is what is meant. \[85\]
So it is the state in virtue of which consciousness and its concomitants
remain evenly and rightly on a single object, undistracted and
unscattered, that should be understood as concentrating.



[4.](iii) *WHAT ARE ITS CHARACTERISTIC, FUNCTION,
MANIFESTATION, AND PROXIMATE CAUSE?* Concentration has non-distraction
as its characteristic.3 Its function is to eliminate distraction. It is
manifested as non-wavering. Because of the words, "Being blissful, his
mind becomes concentrated" (D I 73), its proximate cause is bliss.



[5.](iv) *HOW MANY KINDS OF CONCENTRATION ARE THERE?*



\(1\) First of all it is of one kind with the characteristic of
non-distraction. (2) Then it is of two kinds as access and absorption;4
(3) likewise as mundane and supramundane,5 (4) as with happiness and
without happiness, and (5) as accompanied by bliss and accompanied by
equanimity.6 It is of three kinds (6) as inferior, medium and superior;
likewise (7) as with applied thought and sustained thought, etc., (8) as
accompanied by happiness, etc., and (9) as limited, exalted, and
measureless. It is of four kinds (10) as of difficult progress and
sluggish



3\. "The characteristic of non-distraction is the individual essence
peculiar to concentration. Hence no analysis of it is possible, which is
why he said: *'It is of one kind with the characteristic of
non-distraction'"* (Vism-mhṭ 91).



4\. "Applied thought that occurs as though absorbing *(appento)*
associated states in the object is absorption *(appanā).* Accordingly it
is described as 'absorption, absorbing *(appanā vyappanā)'* (M III 73).
Now since that is the most important, the usage of the Commentaries is
to call all exalted and unsurpassed jhāna states 'absorption' \[as well
as the applied thought itself\], and likewise to apply the term of
common usage 'access' to the limited \[i.e. sense-sphere\] jhāna that
heralds the arising of the former, just as the term 'village access,'
etc. is applied to the neighbourhood of a village" (Vism-mhṭ 91).



5\. "The round *(vaṭṭa,* see XVII.298) \[including fine-material and
immaterial heavens\] is called the world *(loka)* because of its
crumbling *(lujjana)* and disintegrating *(palujjana). 'Mundane'
(lokiya)* means connected with the world because of being included in it
or found there. *'Supramundane' (lokuttara)* means beyond the world,
excepted from it*,* because of not being included in it \[through being
associated with Nibbāna\]" (Vism- mhṭ 91). See also "nine supramundane
states. (VII.68, 74f.)"



6\. In loose usage *pīti* (happiness) and *sukha* (pleasure or bliss)
are almost synonyms. They become differentiated in the jhāna formulas
(see IV.100), and then technically *pīti*, as the active thrill of
rapture, is classed under the formations aggregate and *sukha* under the
feeling aggregate. The valuable word "happiness" was chosen for *pīti*
rather than the possible alternatives of "joy" (needed for *somanassa),*
"interest" (which is too flat), "rapture" (which is overcharged), or
"zest." For *sukha,* while "pleasure" seemed to fit admirably where
ordinary pleasant feeling is intended, another, less crass, word seemed
necessary for the refined pleasant feeling of jhāna and the "bliss" of
Nibbāna (which is not feeling aggregate---see M I 400). "Ease" is
sometimes used. "Neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling is intended here
by 'equanimity' *(upekkhā,* lit, onlooking); for it 'looks on'
*(upekkhati)* at the occurrence of \[bodily\] pleasure and pain by
maintaining the neutral (central) mode" (Vism-mhṭ 92).



[]



[]



direct-knowledge, etc.; likewise (11) as limited with limited object,
etc., (12) according to the factors of the four jhānas, (13) as
partaking of diminution, etc., (14) as of the sense sphere, etc., and
(15) as predominance, and so on. (16) It is of five kinds according to
the factors of the five jhānas reckoned by the fivefold method.



[6.]Herein, the section dealing with that of one
kind is evident in meaning.



*2.* In the section dealing with that of two kinds, *access *
concentration is the unification of mind obtained by the following, that
is to say, the six recollections, mindfulness of death, the recollection
of peace, the perception of repulsiveness in nutriment, and the defining
of the four elements, and it is the unification that precedes absorption
concentration. *Absorption* concentration is the unification that
follows immediately upon the preliminary-work (IV.74) because of the
words, "The first-jhāna preliminary-work is a condition, as proximity
condition, for the first jhāna" (Paṭṭh II 350 (Se). So it is of two
kinds as access and absorption.



[7.]In the second dyad *mundane* concentration is
profitable unification of mind in the three planes. *Supramundane*
concentration is the unification associated with the noble paths. So it
is of two kinds as mundane and supramundane.



[8.]In the third dyad concentration *with
happiness* is the unification of mind in two jhānas in the fourfold
reckoning and in three jhānas in the fivefold reckoning. \[86\]
Concentration *without happiness* is the unification in the remaining
two jhānas. But access concentration may be with happiness or without
happiness. So it is of two kinds as with happiness and without
happiness.



[9.]In the fourth dyad concentration *accompanied
by bliss* is the unification in three jhānas in the fourfold and four in
the fivefold reckoning. That *accompanied by equanimity* is that in the
remaining jhāna. Access concentration may be accompanied by bliss or
accompanied by equanimity. So it is of two kinds as accompanied by bliss
and accompanied by equanimity.



[10.] *6.* In the first of the triads what has only just been
acquired is *inferior*. What is not very well developed is *medium*.
What is well developed and has reached mastery is *superior*. So it is
of three kinds as inferior, medium, and superior.



[11.]In the second triad that *with applied
thought and sustained thought* is the concentration of the first jhāna
together with access concentration. That *without applied thought, with
sustained thought only*, is the concentration of the second jhāna in the
fivefold reckoning. For when a man sees danger only in applied thought
and not in sustained thought, he aspires only to abandon applied thought
when he passes beyond the first jhāna, and so he obtains concentration
without applied thought and with sustained thought only. This is said
with reference to him. Concentration *without applied thought and
sustained thought* is the unification in the three jhānas beginning with
the second in the fourfold reckoning and with the third in the fivefold
reckoning (see D III 219). So it is of three kinds as with applied
thought and sustained thought, and so on.



[12.] *8.* In the third triad concentration *accompanied by
happiness* is the unification in the two first jhānas in the fourfold
reckoning and in the three first jhānas in the fivefold reckoning.
Concentration *accompanied by bliss* is the unification in those same
jhānas and in the third and the fourth respectively in the two
reckonings.



[]



[]



That *accompanied by equanimity* is that in the remaining jhāna. Access
concentration may be accompanied by bliss and happiness or accompanied
by equanimity. So it is of three kinds as accompanied by happiness, and
so on.



[13.]In the fourth triad *limited* concentration
is unification on the plane of access. *Exalted* concentration is
unification in profitable \[consciousness, etc.,\] of the fine- material
sphere and immaterial sphere. *Measureless * concentration is
unification associated with the noble paths. So it is of three kinds as
limited, exalted, and measureless.



[14.]In the first of the tetrads there is
concentration of *difficult progress and sluggish direct-knowledge*.
There is that of difficult progress and swift direct- knowledge. There
is that of easy progress and sluggish direct-knowledge. And there is
that of easy progress and swift direct-knowledge.



[15.]Herein, the development of concentration that occurs from
the time of the first conscious reaction up to the arising of the access
of a given jhāna is called *progress*. And the understanding that occurs
from the time of access until absorption is called *direct-knowledge*.
That progress is difficult for some, being troublesome owing to the
tenacious resistance of the inimical states beginning with the
hindrances. The meaning is that it is cultivated without ease. \[87\] It
is easy for others because of the absence of those difficulties. Also
the direct-knowledge is sluggish in some and occurs slowly, not quickly.
In others it is swift and occurs rapidly, not slowly.



[16.]Herein, we shall comment below upon the suitable and
unsuitable (IV.35f.), the preparatory tasks consisting in the severing
of impediments (IV.20), etc., and skill in absorption (IV.42). When a
man cultivates what is unsuitable, his progress is difficult and his
direct-knowledge sluggish. When he cultivates what is suitable, his
progress is easy and his direct-knowledge swift. But if he cultivates
the unsuitable in the earlier stage and the suitable in the later stage,
or if he cultivates the suitable in the earlier stage and the unsuitable
in the later stage, then it should be understood as mixed in his case.
Likewise if he devotes himself to development without carrying out the
preparatory tasks of severing impediments, etc., his progress is
difficult. It is easy in the opposite case. And if he is not
accomplished in skill in absorption, his direct- knowledge is sluggish.
It is swift if he is so accomplished.



[17.] Besides, they should be understood as classed according
to craving and ignorance, and according to whether one has had practice
in serenity and insight.7 For if a man is overwhelmed by craving, his
progress is difficult. If not, it is easy. And if he is overwhelmed by
ignorance, his direct-knowledge is sluggish. If not, it is swift. And if
he has had no practice in serenity, his progress is difficult. If he
has, it is easy. And if he has had no practice in insight, his
direct-knowledge is sluggish. If he has, it is swift.



[18.]Also they should be understood as classed according to
defilements and faculties. For if a man's defilements are sharp and his
faculties dull, then his progress



7\. *Samatha---*"serenity" is a synonym for absorption concentration,
and "insight" *(vipassanā) * a synonym for understanding. *Samatha * is
sometimes rendered by "tranquillity" (reserved here for *passaddhi)* or
"calm" or "quiet."



[]



[]



is difficult and his direct-knowledge sluggish; but if his faculties are
keen, his direct-knowledge is swift. And if his defilements are blunt
and his faculties dull, then his progress is easy and his
direct-knowledge sluggish; but if his faculties are keen, his
direct-knowledge is swift.



[19.]So as regards this progress and this direct-knowledge,
when a person reaches concentration with difficult progress and sluggish
direct-knowledge, his concentration is called *concentration of
difficult progress and sluggish direct-knowledge*; similarly in the
cases of the remaining three.



So it is of four kinds as of difficult progress and sluggish
direct-knowledge, and



so on.



[20.]In the second tetrad there is limited
concentration with a limited object, there is limited concentration with
a measureless object, there is measureless concentration with a limited
object, and there is measureless concentration with a measureless
object. Herein, concentration that is unfamiliar and incapable of being
a condition for a higher jhāna \[88\] is *limited*. When it occurs with
an unextended object (IV.126), it is *with a limited object*. When it is
familiar, well developed, and capable of being a condition for a higher
jhāna, it is *measureless*. And when it occurs with an extended object,
it is *with* *a measureless object*. The mixed method can be understood
as the mixture of the characteristics already stated. So it is of four
kinds as limited with limited object, and so on.



[21.]In the third tetrad the first jhāna has
five factors, that is to say, applied thought, sustained thought,
happiness, bliss, and concentration, following suppression of the
hindrances. The second has the three factors remaining after the
elimination of applied and sustained thought. The third has two factors
with the fading away of happiness. The fourth, where bliss is abandoned,
has two factors with concentration and the equanimous feeling that
accompanies it. Thus there are four kinds of concentration according to
the factors of these four jhānas. So it is of four kinds according to
the factors of the four jhānas.



[22.]In the fourth tetrad there is concentration
partaking of diminution, there is concentration partaking of stagnation,
there is concentration partaking of distinction, and there is
concentration partaking of penetration. Herein, it should be understood
that the state of *partaking of diminution* is accessibility to
opposition, the state of *partaking of stagnation* (*ṭhiti*) is
stationariness (*saṇṭhāna*) of the mindfulness that is in conformity
with that \[concentration\], the state of *partaking of distinction * is
the attaining of higher distinction, and the state of *partaking of
penetration* is accessibility to perception and attention accompanied by
dispassion, according as it is said: "When a man has attained the first
jhāna and he is accessible to perception and attention accompanied by
sense desire, then his understanding partakes of diminution. When his
mindfulness that is in conformity with that stagnates, then his
understanding partakes of stagnation. When he is accessible to
perception and attention unaccompanied by applied thought, then his
understanding partakes of distinction. When he is accessible to
perception and attention accompanied by dispassion and directed to
fading away, then his understanding partakes of penetration" (Vibh 330).
The kinds of concentration



[]



[]



associated with that \[fourfold\] understanding are also four in number.
So it is of four kinds as partaking of diminution, and so on.



[23.]In the fifth tetrad there are the following
four kinds of concentration, that is to say, sense-sphere concentration,
fine-material-sphere concentration, immaterial- sphere concentration,
and unincluded \[that is, path\] concentration. Herein, *sense- sphere
concentration* is all kinds of access unification. Likewise the other
three are respectively profitable unification of mind associated with
fine-material, \[immaterial, and path, jhāna\]. So it is of four kinds
as of the sense-sphere, and so on.



[24.]In the sixth tetrad: "If a bhikkhu obtains
concentration, obtains unification of mind, by making zeal (desire)
predominant, \[89\] this is called concentration due to zeal. If ... by
making energy predominant ... If ... by making \[natural purity of\]
consciousness predominant... If ... by making inquiry predominant, this
is called concentration due to inquiry" (Vibh 216--19). So it is of four
kinds as predominance.



[25.]In the pentad there are five jhānas by
dividing in two what is called the second jhāna in the fourfold
reckoning (see §21), taking the second jhāna to be due to the
surmounting of only applied thought and the third jhāna to be due to the
surmounting of both applied and sustained thought. There are five kinds
of concentration according to the factors of these five jhānas. So its
fivefoldness should be understood according to the five sets of jhāna
factors.



[26.](v) *What is its defilement?* (vi) *What is its
cleansing?* Here the answer is given in the Vibhaṅga: "Defilement is the
state partaking of diminution, cleansing is the state partaking of
distinction" (Vibh 343). Herein, the state partaking of diminution
should be understood in this way: "When a man has attained the first
jhāna and he is accessible to perception and attention accompanied by
sense desire, then his understanding partakes of diminution" (Vibh 330).
And the state partaking of distinction should be understood in this way:
"When he is accessible to perception and attention unaccompanied by
applied thought, then his understanding partakes of distinction" (Vibh
330).



[27.](vii) *How should it be developed?* \[A. DEVELOPMENT IN
BRIEF\]



The method of developing the kind of concentration associated with the
noble paths mentioned (§7) under that "of two kinds as mundane and
supramundane," etc., is included in the method of developing
understanding; (Ch. XXII) for in developing \[path\] understanding that
is developed too. So we shall say nothing separately \[here\] about how
that is to be developed.



[28.]But mundane concentration should be developed by one who
has taken his stand on virtue that is quite purified in the way already
stated. He should sever any of the ten impediments that he may have. He
should then approach the good friend, the giver of a meditation subject,
and he should apprehend from among the forty meditation subjects one
that suits his own temperament. After that he should avoid a monastery
unfavourable to the development of concentration and

\[B. DEVELOPMENT IN DETAIL\]



[29.]The detail is this:



\[THE TEN IMPEDIMENTS\]



Firstly it was said above, *he should sever any of the ten impediments
that he may*



*have*. \[90\] Now, the "ten impediments" are:



A dwelling, family, and gain,\
A class, and building too as fifth,\
And travel, kin, affliction, books,\
And supernormal powers: ten.



Herein, the dwelling itself is the "impediment due to the dwelling." So
too with



the family and so on.



[30.] *1.* Herein, a single inner room or a single hut or a
whole monastery for the Community is called a *dwelling*. This is not an
impediment for everyone. It is an impediment only for anyone whose mind
is exercised about the building, etc., that goes on there, or who has
many belongings stored there, or whose mind is caught up by some
business connected with it. For any other it is not an impediment.



[31.] Here is a relevant story. Two clansmen left Anurādhapura,
it seems, and eventually went forth at the Thūpārāma.8 One of them made
himself familiar with the Two Codes,9 and when he had acquired five
years' seniority, he took part in the Pavāraṇā10 and then left for the
place called Pācīnakhaṇḍarājī.11 The other stayed on where he was. Now,
when the one who had gone to Pācīnakhaṇḍarājī had lived there a long
time and had become an elder,12 he thought, "This place is good for
retreat; suppose I told my friend about it?" So he set out, and in due
course he entered the Thūpārāma. As he entered, the elder of the same
seniority saw him, went to meet him, took his bowl and robe and did the
duties.



8\. One of the principal monasteries in Anurādhapura.\



9\. *Dve mātikā---*the "two codes": see Ch. I, n. 11. But Vism-mhṭ says
here: *"'Observers* *of the codes'* are observers of the codes
(summaries) of the Dhamma and Vinaya" (Vism-mhṭ 117).\



10\. *Pavāraṇa:* ceremony held at the end of the rains, during three
months of which season bhikkhus have to undertake to live in one place
in order to avoid travel while crops are growing. It consists in a
meeting of the bhikkhus who have spent the rains together, at which each
member present invites *(pavāreti)* the Community to point out his
faults (breaches of Vinaya rules) committed during the preceding three
months (Vin I 155).\



11\. "*Pācinakhaṇḍarājā ti puratthimadisāya pabbatakhaṇḍānaṃ antare
vanarājīṭṭhānaṃ*" (Vism-mhṭ 97).\



12\. For the first five years after the admission *(upasampadā)* a
bhikkhu is called a "new *(nava) * bhikkhu"; from five to ten years he
is called a "middle *(majjhima) * bhikkhu"; with ten or more years'
seniority he is called an "elder *(thera)* bhikkhu."



go to live in one that is favourable. Then he should sever the lesser
impediments and not overlook any of the directions for development. This
is in brief.



[]



[]



[32.]The visiting elder went into his lodging. He thought, "Now
my friend will be sending me ghee or molasses or a drink; for he has
lived long in this city." He got nothing that night, and in the morning
he thought, "Now he will be sending me rice gruel and solid food sent by
his supporters." When he saw none, he thought, "There is no one to bring
it. No doubt they will give it when we go into the town." Early in the
morning they went into the town together. When they had wandered through
one street and had got only a ladleful of gruel, they sat down in a
sitting hall to drink it.13



[33.]Then the visitor thought, "Perhaps there is no individual
giving of gruel. But as soon as it is the time for the meal people will
give special food." But when it was time for the meal, they ate what
they had got by wandering for alms. Then the visitor said, "Venerable
sir, how is this? Do you live in this way all the time?"--- "Yes,
friend."---"Venerable sir, Pācīnakhaṇḍarājī is comfortable; let us go
there." Now, as the elder came out from the city \[91\] by the southern
gate he took the Kumbhakāragāma road \[which leads to
Pācīnakhaṇḍarājī\]. The visitor asked, "But, venerable sir, why do you
take this road?"---"Did you not recommend Pācīnakhaṇḍarājī,
friend?"---"But how is this, venerable sir, have you no extra belongings
in the place you have lived in for so long?"---"That is so, friend. The
bed and chair belong to the Community, and they are put away \[as
usual\]. There is nothing else."---"But, venerable sir, I have left my
staff and my oil tube and my sandal bag there."---"Have you already
collected so much, friend, living there for just one day?"---"Yes,
venerable sir."



[34.]He was glad in his heart, and he paid homage to the elder:
"For those like you, venerable sir, everywhere is a forest dwelling. The
Thūpārāma is a place where the relics of four Buddhas are deposited;
there is suitable hearing of the Dhamma in the Brazen Palace; there is
the Great Shrine to be seen; and one can visit elders. It is like the
time of the Buddha. It is here that you should live." On the following
day he took his bowl and \[outer\] robe and went away by himself. It is
no impediment for one like that.



[35.]*2  Family* means a family consisting of relatives or of
supporters. For even a family consisting of supporters is an impediment
for someone who lives in close association with it in the way beginning,
"He is pleased when they are pleased" (S III 11), and who does not even
go to a neighbouring monastery to hear the Dhamma without members of the
family.



[36.]But even mother and father are not an impediment for
another, as in the case of the young bhikkhu, the nephew of the elder
who lived at the Koraṇḍaka Monastery. He went to Rohaṇa for instruction,
it seems. The elder's sister, who was a lay devotee, was always asking
the elder how her son was getting on. One day the elder set out for
Rohaṇa to fetch him back.



[37.]The young bhikkhu too thought, "I have lived here for a
long time. Now I might go and visit my preceptor and find out how the
lay devotee is," and he left



13\. The last sentence here might refer to a free mass distribution of
gruel *(yāgu),* which appears to have been more or less constantly
maintained at Anurādhapura.

Rohaṇa. The two met on the banks of the \[Mahaveli\] River. He did the
duties to the elder at the foot of a tree. When asked, "Where are you
going?" he told him his purpose. The elder said: "You have done well.
The lay devotee is always asking after you. That was why I came. You may
go, but I shall stay here for the Rains," and he dismissed him. \[92\]
He arrived at the monastery on the actual day for taking up residence
for the Rains. The lodging allotted to him happened to be the one for
which his father had undertaken responsibility.



[38.]His father came on the following day and asked, "To whom
was our lodging allotted, venerable sirs?" When he heard that it had
fallen to a young visitor, he went to him. After paying homage to him,
he said, "Venerable sir, there is an obligation for him who has taken up
residence for the Rains in our lodging."--- "What is it, lay
follower?"---"It is to take alms food only in our house for the three
months, and to let us know the time of departure after the Pavāraṇā
ceremony." He consented in silence. The lay devotee went home and told
his wife. "There is a visiting lord who has taken up residence for the
Rains in our lodging. He must be carefully looked after," and she
agreed. She prepared good food of various kinds for him.14 Though the
youth went to his relatives' home at the time of the meal, no one
recognized him.



[39.] When he had eaten alms food there during the three months
and had completed the residence for the Rains, he announced his
departure. Then his relatives said, "Let it be tomorrow, venerable sir,"
and on the following day, when they had fed him in their house and
filled his oil tube and given him a lump of sugar and a nine-cubit
length of cloth, they said, "Now you are leaving, venerable sir." He
gave his blessing and set out for Rohaṇa.



[40.]His preceptor had completed the Pavāraṇā ceremony and was
on his way back. They met at the same place as before. He did the duties
to the elder at the foot of a tree. The elder asked him, "How was it, my
dear, did you see the good woman lay devotee?" He replied, "Yes,
venerable sir," and he told him all that had happened. He then anointed
the elder's feet with the oil, made him a drink with the sugar, and
presented him with the length of cloth. He then, after paying homage to
the elder, told him, "Venerable sir, only Rohaṇa suits me," and he
departed. The elder too arrived back at his monastery, and next day he
went into the village of Koraṇḍaka.



[41.]The lay devotee, his sister, had always kept looking down
the road, thinking, "My brother is now coming with my son." When she saw
him coming alone, she thought, "My son must be dead; that is why the
elder is coming alone," and she fell at the elder's feet, lamenting and
weeping. Suspecting that it must have been out of fewness of wishes that
the youth had gone away without announcing himself, \[93\] the elder
comforted her and told her all that had happened, and he took the length
of cloth out of his bag and showed it to her.



14\. It is usual to render the set phrase *paṇītaṃ khādanīyaṃ
bhojanīyaṃ* by some such phrase as "sumptuous food both hard and soft,"
which is literal but unfamiliar- sounding.



[]



[]



[42.]She was appeased. She prostrated herself in the direction
taken by her son, and she said: "Surely the Blessed One taught the way
of the Rathavinīta, the way of the Nālaka, the way of the Tuvaṭaka, and
the way of the great Noble Ones' heritages15 showing contentment with
the four requisites and delight in development, making a bhikkhu such as
my son a body-witness. So, although for three months he ate in the house
of the mother who bore him, yet he never said 'I am your son, you are my
mother!' Oh, admirable man!" Even mother and father are no impediment
for one such as him, so how much less any other family that supports
him.



[43.] *3. Gain * is the four requisites. How are they an
impediment? Wherever a meritorious bhikkhu goes, people give him a large
supply of requisites. With giving blessings to them and teaching them
the Dhamma he gets no chance to do the ascetic's duties. From sunrise
till the first watch of the night he never breaks his association with
people. Again, even at dawn, alms-food eaters fond of opulence come and
say, "Venerable sir, such and such a man lay follower, woman lay
follower, friend, friend's daughter, wants to see you," and being ready
to go, he replies, "Take the bowl and robe, friend." So he is always on
the alert. Thus these requisites are an impediment for him. He should
leave his group and wander by himself where he is not known. This is the
way his impediment is severed.



[44.]*4 Class* is a class (group) of students of suttas or
students of Abhidhamma. If with the group's instruction and questioning
he gets no opportunity for the ascetic's duties, then that group is an
impediment for him. He should sever that impediment in this way: if
those bhikkhus have already acquired the main part and little still
remains, he should finish that off and then go to the forest. If they
have only acquired little and much still remains, \[94\] he should,
without travelling more than a league, approach another instructor of a
class within the radius of a league and say, "Help those venerable ones
with instruction, etc." If he does not find anyone in this way, he
should take leave of the class, saying. "I have a task to see to,
friends; go where it suits you," and he should do his own work.



[45.]*5. Building* (*kamma*) is new building work
(*nava-kamma*). Since one engaged in this must know about what
\[material\] has and has not been got by carpenters, etc., and must see
about what has and has not been done, it is always an impediment. It
should be severed in this way. If little remains it should be completed.
If much remains, it should be handed over to the Community or to
bhikkhus who are entrusted with the Community's affairs, if it is a new
building for the Community; or if it is for himself, it should be handed
over to those whom he entrusts with his own affairs, but if these are
not available, he should relinquish it to the Community and depart.



15\. "The way of the Rathavinīta *(Rathavinīta-paṭipadā)":* this is a
reference to certain suttas that were adopted by bhikkhus as a "way"
*(paṭipadā)* or guide to practice. The suttas mentioned here are
Rathavinīta (M I 145), Nālaka (Sn, p. 131), Tuvaṭaka (Sn 179), Noble
One's Heritages (*ariyavaṃsa---*A II 27). Others are mentioned at M-a I
92; III 6; S-a III 291. The Ariyavaṃsa Sutta itself has a long
commentary on practice, and it is mentioned in the Commentaries as a
popular subject for preaching (see e.g. commentary to AN III 42).



[]



[]



[46.]*6. Travel* is going on a journey. If someone is expected
to give the going forth somewhere else, or if some requisite is
obtainable there and he cannot rest content without getting it \[that
will be an impediment; for\] even if he goes into the forest to do the
ascetic's duties, he will find it hard to get rid of thoughts about the
journey. So one in this position should apply himself to the ascetic's
duties after he has done the journey and transacted the business.



[47.]*7 Kin* in the case of the monastery means teacher,
preceptor, co-resident, pupil, those with the same preceptor as oneself,
and those with the same teacher as oneself; and in the case of the house
it means mother, father, brother, and so on. When they are sick they are
an impediment for him. Therefore that impediment should be severed by
curing them with nursing.



[48.]Herein, when the preceptor is sick he must be cared for as
long as life lasts if the sickness does not soon depart. Likewise the
teacher at the going forth, the teacher at the admission, the
co-resident, the pupils to whom one has given the admission and the
going forth, and those who have the same preceptor. But the teacher from
whom one takes the dependence, the teacher who gives one instruction,
the pupil to whom one has given the dependence, the pupil to whom one is
giving instruction, and those who have that same teacher as oneself,
should be looked after as long as the dependence or the instruction has
not been terminated. If one is able to do so, one should look after them
even beyond that \[period\].



[49.]Mother and father should be treated like the preceptor; if
they live within the kingdom and look to their son for help, it should
be given. \[95\] Also if they have no medicine, he should give them his
own. If he has none, he should go in search of it as alms and give that.
But in the case of brothers or sisters, one should only give them what
is theirs. If they have none, then one should give one's own temporarily
and later get it back, but one should not complain if one does not get
it back. It is not allowed either to make medicine for or to give it to
a sister's husband who is not related by blood; but one can give it to
one's sister saying, "Give it to your husband." The same applies to
one's brother's wife. But it is allowed to make it for their children
since they are blood relatives.



[50.]*8. Affliction * is any kind of illness. It is an
impediment when it is actually afflicting; therefore it should be
severed by treatment with medicine. But if it is not cured after taking
medicine for a few days, then the ascetic's duties should be done after
apostrophizing one's person in this way: "I am not your slave, or your
hireling. I have come to suffering through maintaining you through the
beginningless round of rebirths."



[51.] *9. Books* means responsibility for the scriptures. That
is an impediment only for one who is constantly busy with recitations,
etc., but not for others. Here are relevant stories. The Elder Revata,
it seems, the Majjhima reciter, went to the Elder Revata, the dweller in
Malaya (the Hill Country), and asked him for a meditation subject. The
elder asked him, "How are you in the scriptures, friend?"---"I am
studying the Majjhima \[Nikāya\], venerable sir."---"The Majjhima is a
hard responsibility, friend. When a man is still learning the First
Fifty by heart, he is faced with the Middle Fifty; and when he is still
learning that by heart, he is faced



[]



[]



with the Last Fifty. How can you take up a meditation
subject?"---"Venerable sir, when I have taken a meditation subject from
you, I shall not look at the scriptures again." He took the meditation
subject, and doing no recitation for nineteen years, he reached
Arahantship in the twentieth year. He told bhikkhus who came for
recitation: "I have not looked at the scriptures for twenty years,
friends, \[96\] yet I am familiar with them. You may begin." And from
beginning to end he had no hesitation even over a single syllable.



[52.]The Elder Mahā-Nāga, too, who lived at Karuliyagiri
(Karaliyagiri) put aside the scriptures for eighteen years, and then he
recited the Dhātukathā to the bhikkhus. When they checked this with the
town-dwelling elders \[of Anurādha- pura\], not a single question was
found out of its order.



[53.]In the Great Monastery too the Elder Tipiṭaka-Cūḷa-Abhaya
had the golden drum struck, saying: "I shall expound the three Piṭakas
in the circle of \[experts in\] the Five Collections of discourses," and
this was before he had learnt the commentaries. The Community of
Bhikkhus said, "'Which teachers' teaching is it? Unless you give only
the teaching of our own teachers we shall not let you speak." Also his
preceptor asked him when he went to wait on him, "Did you have the drum
beaten, friend?"---"Yes, venerable sir."---"For what reason?"---"I shall
expound the scriptures, venerable sir."---"Friend Abhaya, how do the
teachers explain this passage?"---"They explain it in this way,
venerable sir." The elder dissented, saying "Hum." Again three times,
each time in a different way, he said, "They explain it in this way,
venerable sir." The elder always dissented, saying, "Hum." Then he said,
"Friend, your first explanation was the way of the teachers. But it is
because you have not actually learnt it from the teachers' lips that you
are unable to maintain that the teachers say such and such. Go and learn
it from our own teachers."---"Where shall I go, venerable sir?"---"There
is an elder named Mahā Dhammarakkhita living in the Tulādhārapabbata
Monastery in the Rohaṇa country beyond the \[Mahaveli\] River. He knows
all the scriptures. Go to him." Saying, "Good, venerable sir," he paid
homage to the elder. He went with five hundred bhikkhus to the Elder
Mahā-Dhammarakkhita, and when he had paid homage to him, he sat down.
The elder asked, "Why have you come?"---"To hear the Dhamma, venerable
sir."---"Friend Abhaya, they ask me about the Dīgha and the Majjhima
from time to time, but I have not looked at the others for thirty years.
Still you may repeat them in my presence by night, and I shall explain
them to you by day." He said, "Good, venerable sir," and he acted
accordingly.



[54.]The inhabitants of the village had a large pavilion built
at the door of his dwelling, and they came daily to hear the Dhamma.
Explaining by day what had been repeated by night, \[97\] the Elder
\[Dhammarakkhita\] eventually completed the instruction. Then he sat
down on a mat on the ground before the Elder Abhaya and said, "Friend,
explain a meditation subject to me."---"What are you saying, venerable
sir, have I not heard it all from you? What can I explain to you that
you do not already know?" The senior elder said, "This path is different
for one who has actually travelled by."



[55.]The Elder Abhaya was then, it seems, a stream-enterer.
When the Elder Abhaya had given his teacher a meditation subject, he
returned to Anurādhapura. Later,



[]



[]



while he was expounding the Dhamma in the Brazen Palace, he heard that
the elder had attained Nibbāna. On hearing this, he said, "Bring me
\[my\] robe, friends." Then he put on the robe and said, "The Arahant
path befits our teacher, friends. Our teacher was a true thoroughbred.
He sat down on a mat before his own Dhamma pupil and said, 'Explain a
meditation subject to me.' The Arahant path befits our teacher,
friends."



For such as these, books are no impediment.



[56.] *10. Supernormal powers* are the supernormal powers of
the ordinary man. They are hard to maintain, like a prone infant or like
young corn, and the slightest thing breaks them. But they are an
impediment for insight, not for concentration, since they are obtainable
through concentration. So the supernormal powers are an impediment that
should be severed by one who seeks insight; the others are impediments
to be severed by one who seeks concentration.



This, in the first place, is the detailed explanation of the
impediments.



[57.]*Approach the good friend, the giver of a meditation
subject* (§28): meditation subjects are of two kinds, that is, generally
useful meditation subjects and special meditation subjects. Herein,
loving-kindness towards the Community of Bhikkhus, etc., and also
mindfulness of death are what are called generally useful meditation
subjects. Some say perception of foulness, too.



[58.] When a bhikkhu takes up a meditation subject, he should
first develop loving-kindness towards the Community of Bhikkhus within
the boundary,16 limiting it at first \[to "all bhikkhus in this
monastery"\], in this way: "May they be happy and free from affliction."
Then he should develop it towards all deities within the boundary. Then
towards all the principal people in the village that is his alms resort;
then to \[all human beings there and to\] all living beings dependent on
the human beings. With loving-kindness towards the Community of Bhikkhus
he produces kindliness in his co-residents; then they are easy for him
to live with. With loving-kindness towards the deities within the
boundary he is protected by kindly deities with lawful protection.
\[98\] With loving- kindness towards the principal people in the village
that is his alms resort his requisites are protected by well-disposed
principal people with lawful protection. With loving-kindness to all
human beings there he goes about without incurring their dislike since
they trust him. With loving-kindness to all living beings he can wander
unhindered everywhere.



With mindfulness of death, thinking, "I have got to die," he gives up
improper search (see S II 194; M-a I 115), and with a growing sense of
urgency he comes to live without attachment. When his mind is familiar
with the perception of foulness, then even divine objects do not tempt
his mind to greed.



16\. *Sīmā---*"boundary": loosely used in this sense, it corresponds
vaguely to what is meant by "parish." In the strict sense it is the
actual area (usually a "chapter house") agreed according to the rules
laid down in the Vinaya and marked by boundary stones, within which the
Community *(saṅgha)* carries out its formal acts.



[]



[]



[59.]So these are called "generally useful" and they are
"called meditation subjects" since they are needed17 generally and
desirable owing to their great helpfulness and since they are subjects
for the meditation work intended.



[60.]What is called a "special meditation subject" is that one
from among the forty meditation subjects that is suitable to a man's own
temperament. It is "special" (*pārihāriya*) because he must carry it
(*pariharitabbattā*) constantly about with him, and because it is the
proximate cause for each higher stage of development.



So it is the one who gives this twofold meditation subject that is
called the *giver*



*of a meditation subject*.



[61.]*The* *good friend* is one who possesses such special
qualities as these:



He is revered and dearly loved,\
And one who speaks and suffers speech;\
The speech he utters is profound,\
He does not urge without a reason (A IV 32) and so on.\
He is wholly solicitous of welfare and partial to progress.



[62.]Because of the words beginning, "Ānanda, it is owing to my
being a good friend to them that living beings subject to birth are
freed from birth" (S I 88), it is only the Fully Enlightened One who
possesses all the aspects of the good friend. Since that is so, while he
is available only a meditation subject taken in the Blessed One's
presence is well taken.



But after his final attainment of Nibbāna, it is proper to take it from
anyone of the eighty great disciples still living. When they are no more
available, one who wants to take a particular meditation subject should
take it from someone with cankers destroyed, who has, by means of that
particular meditation subject, produced the fourfold and fivefold jhāna,
and has reached the destruction of cankers by augmenting insight that
had that jhāna as its proximate cause.



[63.]But how then, does someone with cankers destroyed declare
himself thus: "I am one whose cankers are destroyed?" Why not? He
declares himself when he knows that his instructions will be carried
out. Did not the Elder Assagutta \[99\] spread out his leather mat in
the air and sitting cross-legged on it explain a meditation subject to a
bhikkhu who was starting his meditation subject, because he knew that
that bhikkhu was one who would carry out his instructions for the
meditation subject?



[64.]So if someone with cankers destroyed is available, that is
good. If not, then one should take it from a non-returner, a
once-returner, a stream-enterer, an ordinary man who has obtained jhāna,
one who knows three Piṭakas, one who knows two Piṭakas, one who knows
one Piṭaka, in descending order \[according as available\]. If not even
one who knows one Piṭaka is available, then it should be taken from one
who is familiar with one Collection together with its commentary and one
who is himself conscientious. For a teacher such as this, who knows the
texts, guards the heritage, and protects the tradition, will follow the
teachers' opinion rather than his own. Hence the Ancient Elders said
three times, "One who is conscientious will guard it."



17\. *Atthayitabba---"*needed": not in PED, not in CPD.



[]



[]



[65.]Now, those beginning with one whose cankers are destroyed,
mentioned above, will describe only the path they have themselves
reached. But with a learned man, his instructions and his answers to
questions are purified by his having approached such and such teachers,
and so he will explain a meditation subject showing a broad track, like
a big elephant going through a stretch of jungle, and he will select
suttas and reasons from here and there, adding \[explanations of\] what
is suitable and unsuitable. So a meditation subject should be taken by
approaching the good friend such as this, the giver of a meditation
subject, and by doing all the duties to him.



[66.]If he is available in the same monastery, it is good. If
not, one should go to where he lives.



When \[a bhikkhu\] goes to him, he should not do so with feet washed and
anointed, wearing sandals, with an umbrella, surrounded by pupils, and
bringing oil tube, honey, molasses, etc.; he should do so fulfilling the
duties of a bhikkhu setting out on a journey, carrying his bowl and
robes himself, doing all the duties in each monastery on the way, with
few belongings, and living in the greatest effacement. When entering
that monastery, he should do so \[expecting nothing, and even provided\]
with a tooth-stick that he has had made allowable on the way \[according
to the rules\]. And he should not enter some other room, thinking, "I
shall go to the teacher after resting awhile and after washing and
anointing my feet, and so on."



[67.]Why? If there are bhikkhus there who are hostile to the
teacher, they might ask him the reason for his coming and speak
dispraise of the teacher, saying, "You are done for if you go to him";
\[100\] they might make him regret his coming and turn him back. So he
should ask for the teacher's dwelling and go straight there.



[68.]If the teacher is junior, he should not consent to the
teacher's receiving his bowl and robe, and so on. If the teacher is
senior, then he should go and pay homage to him and remain standing.
When told, "Put down the bowl and robe, friend," he may put them down.
When told, "Have some water to drink," he can drink if he wants to. When
told, "You may wash your feet," he should not do so at once, for if the
water has been brought by the teacher himself, it would be improper. But
when told "Wash, friend, it was not brought by me, it was brought by
others," then he can wash his feet, sitting in a screened place out of
sight of the teacher, or in the open to one side of the dwelling.



[69.]If the teacher brings an oil tube, he should get up and
take it carefully with both hands. If he did not take it, it might make
the teacher wonder, "Does this bhikkhu resent sharing so soon?" but
having taken it, he should not anoint his feet at once. For if it were
oil for anointing the teacher's limbs, it would not be proper. So he
should first anoint his head, then his shoulders, etc.; but when told,
"This is meant for all the limbs, friend, anoint your feet," he should
put a little on his head and then anoint his feet. Then he should give
it back, saying when the teacher takes it, "May I return this oil tube,
venerable sir?"



[70.]He should not say, "Explain a meditation subject to me,
venerable sir" on the very day he arrives. But starting from the next
day, he can, if the teacher has a



[]



[]



habitual attendant, ask his permission to do the duties. If he does not
allow it when asked, they can be done when the opportunity offers. When
he does them, three tooth-sticks should be brought, a small, a medium
and a big one, and two kinds of mouth-washing water and bathing water,
that is, hot and cold, should be set out. Whichever of these the teacher
uses for three days should then be brought regularly. If the teacher
uses either kind indiscriminately, he can bring whatever is available.



[71.]Why so many words? All should be done as prescribed by the
Blessed One in the Khandhakas as the right duties in the passage
beginning: "Bhikkhus, a pupil should perform the duties to the teacher
\[101\] rightly. Herein, this is the right performance of duties. He
should rise early; removing his sandals and arranging his robe on one
shoulder, he should give the tooth-sticks and the mouth-washing water,
and he should prepare the seat. If there is rice gruel, he should wash
the dish and bring the rice gruel" (Vin I 61).



[72.]To please the teacher by perfection in the duties he
should pay homage in the evening, and he should leave when dismissed
with the words, "You may go." When the teacher asks him, "Why have you
come?" he can explain the reason for his coming. If he does not ask but
agrees to the duties being done, then after ten days or a fortnight have
gone by he should make an opportunity by staying back one day at the
time of his dismissal, and announcing the reason for his coming; or he
should go at an unaccustomed time, and when asked, "What have you come
for?" he can announce it.



[73.]If the teacher says, "Come in the morning," he should do
so. But if his stomach burns with a bile affliction at that hour, or if
his food does not get digested owing to sluggish digestive heat, or if
some other ailment afflicts him, he should let it be known, and
proposing a time that suits himself, he should come at that time. For if
a meditation subject is expounded at an inconvenient time, one cannot
give attention.



This is the detailed explanation of the words "approach the good friend,
the



giver of a meditation subject."



[74.]Now, as to the words, *one that suits his temperament*
(§28): there are six kinds of temperament, that is, greedy temperament,
hating temperament, deluded temperament, faithful temperament,
intelligent temperament, and speculative temperament. Some would have
fourteen, taking these six single ones together with the four made up of
the three double combinations and one triple combination with the greed
triad and likewise with the faith triad. But if this classification is
admitted, there are many more kinds of temperament possible by combining
greed, etc., with faith, etc.; therefore the kinds of temperament should
be understood briefly as only six. As to meaning the temperaments are
one, that is to say, personal nature, idiosyncrasy. According to \[102\]
these there are only six types of persons, that is, one of greedy
temperament, one of hating temperament, one of deluded temperament, one
of faithful temperament, one of intelligent temperament, and one of
speculative temperament.



[75.]Herein, one of faithful temperament is parallel to one of
greedy temperament because faith is strong when profitable \[kamma\]
occurs in one of greedy



[]



[]



temperament, owing to its special qualities being near to those of
greed. For, in an unprofitable way, greed is affectionate and not
over-austere, and so, in a profitable way, is faith. Greed seeks out
sense desires as object, while faith seeks out the special qualities of
virtue and so on. And greed does not give up what is harmful, while
faith does not give up what is beneficial.



[76.]One of intelligent temperament is parallel to one of
hating temperament because understanding is strong when profitable
\[kamma\] occurs in one of hating temperament, owing to its special
qualities being near to those of hate. For, in an unprofitable way, hate
is disaffected and does not hold to its object, and so, in a profitable
way, is understanding. Hate seeks out only unreal faults, while
understanding seeks out only real faults. And hate occurs in the mode of
condemning living beings, while understanding occurs in the mode of
condemning formations.



[77.]One of speculative temperament is parallel to one of
deluded temperament because obstructive applied thoughts arise often in
one of deluded temperament who is striving to arouse unarisen profitable
states, owing to their special qualities being near to those of
delusion. For just as delusion is restless owing to perplexity, so are
applied thoughts that are due to thinking over various aspects. And just
as delusion vacillates owing to superficiality, so do applied thoughts
that are due to facile conjecturing.



[78.]Others say that there are three more kinds of temperament
with craving, pride, and views. Herein craving is simply greed; and
pride18 is associated with that, so neither of them exceeds greed. And
since views have their source in delusion, the temperament of views
falls within the deluded temperament.



[79.]What is the source of these temperaments? And how is it to
be known that such a person is of greedy temperament, that such a person
is of one of those beginning with hating temperament? What suits one of
what kind of temperament?



[80.]Herein, as some say,19 the first three kinds of
temperament to begin with have their source in previous habit; and they
have their source in elements and humours. Apparently one of greedy
temperament has formerly had plenty of desirable tasks and gratifying
work to do, or has reappeared here after dying in a heaven. And one



18\. *Māna,* usually rendered by "pride," is rendered here both by
"pride" and "conceit." Etymologically it is derived perhaps from
*māneti* (to honour) or *mināti* (to measure). In sense, however, it
tends to become associated with *maññati,* to conceive (false notions,
see M I 1), to imagine, to think (as e.g. at Nidd I 80, Vibh 390 and
comy.). As one of the "defilements" (see M I 36) it is probably best
rendered by "pride." In the expression *asmi-māna* (often rendered by
"the pride that says 'I am'") it more nearly approaches *maññanā* (false
imagining, misconception, see M III 246) and is better rendered by the
"conceit 'I am,'" since the word "conceit" straddles both the meanings
of "pride" (i.e. haughtiness) and "conception."\



19\. "*'Some'* is said with reference to the Elder Upatissa. For it is
put in this way by him in the *Vimuttimagga*. The word *'apparently'*
indicates dissent from what follows" (Vism-mhṭ 103). A similar passage
to that referred to appears in Ch. 6 (Taisho ed. p. 410a) of the Chinese
version of the *Vimuttimagga*, the only one extant.



[]



[]



of hating temperament has formerly had plenty of stabbing and torturing
and brutal work to do or has reappeared here after dying in one of the
hells or the nāga (serpent) existences. And one \[103\] of deluded
temperament has formerly drunk a lot of intoxicants and neglected
learning and questioning, or has reappeared here after dying in the
animal existence. It is in this way that they have their source in
previous habit, they say.



[81.] Then a person is of deluded temperament because two
elements are prominent, that is to say, the earth element and the water
element. He is of hating temperament because the other two elements are
prominent. But he is of greedy temperament because all four are equal.
And as regards the humours, one of greedy temperament has phlegm in
excess and one of deluded temperament has wind in excess. Or one of
deluded temperament has phlegm in excess and one of greedy temperament
has wind in excess. So they have their source in the elements and the
humours, they say.



[82.]\[Now, it can rightly be objected that\] not all of those
who have had plenty of desirable tasks and gratifying work to do, and
who have reappeared here after dying in a heaven, are of greedy
temperament, or the others respectively of hating and deluded
temperament; and there is no such law of prominence of elements (see
XIV.43f.) as that asserted; and only the pair, greed and delusion, are
given in the law of humours, and even that subsequently contradicts
itself; and no source for even one among those beginning with one of
faithful temperament is given. Consequently this definition is
indecisive.



[83.]The following is the exposition according to the opinion
of the teachers of the commentaries; or this is said in the "explanation
of prominence": "The fact that these beings have prominence of greed,
prominence of hate, prominence of delusion, is governed by previous
root-cause.



"For when in one man, at the moment of his accumulating
\[rebirth-producing\] kamma, greed is strong and non-greed is weak,
non-hate and non-delusion are strong and hate and delusion are weak,
then his weak non-greed is unable to prevail over his greed, but his
non-hate and non-delusion being strong are able to prevail over his hate
and delusion. That is why, on being reborn through rebirth-linking given
by that kamma, he has greed, is good-natured and unangry, and possesses
understanding with knowledge like a lightning flash.



[84.]"When, at the moment of another's accumulating kamma,
greed and hate are strong and non-greed and non-hate weak, and
non-delusion is strong and delusion weak, then in the way already stated
he has both greed and hate but possesses understanding with knowledge
like a lightning flash, like the Elder Datta-Abhaya.



"When, at the moment of his accumulating kamma, greed, non-hate and
delusion are strong and the others are weak, then in the way already
stated he both has greed and is dull but is good-tempered20 and unangry,
like the Elder Bahula.



20\. *Sīlaka---*"good-tempered"---*sukhasīla * (good-natured---see §83),
which = *sakhila* (kindly---Vism-mhṭ 104). Not in PED.



[]



[]



"Likewise when, at the moment of his accumulating kamma, the three,
namely, greed, hate and delusion are strong and non-greed, etc., are
weak, then in the way already stated he has both greed and hate and is
deluded. \[104\]



[85.] "When, at the moment of his accumulating kamma,
non-greed, hate and delusion are strong and the others are weak, then in
the way already stated he has little defilement and is unshakable even
on seeing a heavenly object, but he has hate and is slow in
understanding.



"When, at the moment of his accumulating kamma, non-greed, non-hate and
non-delusion are strong and the rest weak, then in the way already
stated he has no greed and no hate, and is good-tempered but slow in
understanding.



"Likewise when, at the moment of his accumulating kamma, non-greed, hate
and non-delusion are strong and the rest weak, then in the way already
stated he both has no greed and possesses understanding but has hate and
is irascible.



"Likewise when, at the moment of his accumulating kamma, the three, that
is, non-hate, non-greed, and non-delusion, are strong and greed, etc.,
are weak, then in the way already stated he has no greed and no hate and
possesses understanding, like the Elder Mahā-Saṅgharakkhita."



[86.]One who, as it is said here, "has greed" is one of greedy
temperament; one who "has hate" and one who "is dull" are respectively
of hating temperament and deluded temperament. One who "possesses
understanding" is one of intelligent temperament. One who "has no greed"
and one who "has no hate" are of faithful temperament because they are
naturally trustful. Or just as one who is reborn through kamma
accompanied by non-delusion is of intelligent temperament, so one who is
reborn through kamma accompanied by strong faith is of faithful
temperament, one who is reborn through kamma accompanied by thoughts of
sense desire is of speculative temperament, and one who is reborn
through kamma accompanied by mixed greed, etc., is of mixed temperament.
So it is the kamma productive of rebirth-linking and accompanied by
someone among the things beginning with greed that should be understood
as the source of the temperaments.



[87.] But it was asked, *and how is it to be known that "This
person is of greedy*



*temperament?*" (§79), and so on. This is explained as follows:



By the posture, by the action,\
By eating, seeing, and so on,\
By the kind of states occurring,\
May temperament be recognized.



[88.] Herein,  *by the*  *posture*: when one of greedy
temperament is walking in his usual manner, he walks carefully, puts his
foot down slowly, puts it down evenly, lifts it up evenly, and his step
is springy.21



One of hating temperament walks as though he were digging with the
points of his



feet, puts his foot down quickly, lifts it up quickly, and his step is
dragged along.



21\. *Ukkuṭika---"*springy*"* is glossed here by *asamphuṭṭhamajjhaṃ*
("not touching in the middle"---Vism-mhṭ 106). This meaning is not in
PED.



[]



[]



One of deluded temperament walks with a perplexed gait, puts his foot
down hesitantly,



lifts it up hesitantly, \[105\] and his step is pressed down suddenly.



And this is said in the account of the origin of the Māgandiya Sutta:



The step of one of greedy nature will be springy;\
The step of one of hating nature, dragged along;\
Deluded, he will suddenly press down his step;\
And one without defilement has a step like this.22



[89.]The stance of one of greedy temperament is confident and
graceful. That of one of hating temperament is rigid. That of one of
deluded temperament is muddled, likewise in sitting. And one of greedy
temperament spreads his bed unhurriedly, lies down slowly, composing his
limbs, and he sleeps in a confident manner. When woken, instead of
getting up quickly, he gives his answer slowly as though doubtful. One
of hating temperament spreads his bed hastily anyhow; with his body
flung down he sleeps with a scowl. When woken, he gets up quickly and
answers as though annoyed. One of deluded temperament spreads his bed
all awry and sleeps mostly face downwards with his body sprawling. When
woken, he gets up slowly, saying, "Hum."



[90.] Since those of faithful temperament, etc., are parallel
to those of greedy



temperament, etc., their postures are therefore like those described
above.



This firstly is how the temperaments may be recognized by the posture.



[91.]*By the action*: also in the acts of sweeping, etc., one
of greedy temperament grasps the broom well, and he sweeps cleanly and
evenly without hurrying or scattering the sand, as if he were strewing
*sinduvāra * flowers. One of hating temperament grasps the broom
tightly, and he sweeps uncleanly and unevenly with a harsh noise,
hurriedly throwing up the sand on each side. One of deluded temperament
grasps the broom loosely, and he sweeps neither cleanly nor evenly,
mixing the sand up and turning it over.



[92.]As with sweeping, so too with any action such as washing
and dyeing robes, and so on. One of greedy temperament acts skilfully,
gently, evenly and carefully. One of hating temperament acts tensely,
stiffly and unevenly. One of deluded temperament acts unskilfully as if
muddled, unevenly and indecisively. \[106\]



Also one of greedy temperament wears his robe neither too tightly nor
too loosely, confidently and level all round. One of hating temperament
wears it too tight and not level all round. One of deluded temperament
wears it loosely and in a muddled way.



Those of faithful temperament, etc., should be understood in the same
way as



those just described, since they are parallel.



This is how the temperaments may be recognized by the actions.



[93.]*By eating*: One of greedy temperament likes eating rich
sweet food. When eating, he makes a round lump not too big and eats
unhurriedly, savouring the various tastes. He enjoys getting something
good. One of hating temperament likes eating rough sour food. When
eating he makes a lump that fills his mouth, and he



22\. See Sn-a 544, A-a 436.



[]



[]



eats hurriedly without savouring the taste. He is aggrieved when he gets
something not good. One of deluded temperament has no settled choice.
When eating, he makes a small un-rounded lump, and as he eats he drops
bits into his dish, smearing his face, with his mind astray, thinking of
this and that.



Also those of faithful temperament, etc., should be understood in the
same way



as those just described since they are parallel.



This is how the temperament may be recognized by eating.



[94.]And *by seeing and so on*: when one of greedy temperament
sees even a slightly pleasing visible object, he looks long as if
surprised, he seizes on trivial virtues, discounts genuine faults, and
when departing, he does so with regret as if unwilling to leave. When
one of hating temperament sees even a slightly unpleasing visible
object, he avoids looking long as if he were tired, he picks out trivial
faults, discounts genuine virtues, and when departing, he does so
without regret as if anxious to leave. When one of deluded temperament
sees any sort of visible object, he copies what others do: if he hears
others criticizing, he criticizes; if he hears others praising, he
praises; but actually he feels equanimity in himself---the equanimity of
unknowing. So too with sounds, and so on.



And those of faithful temperament, etc., should be understood in the
same way



as those just described since they are parallel.



This is how the temperaments may be recognized by seeing and so on.



[95.]*By the kind of states occurring*: in one of greedy
temperament there is frequent occurrence of such states as deceit,
fraud, pride, evilness of wishes, greatness of wishes, discontent,
foppery and personal vanity.23 \[107\] In one of hating temperament
there is frequent occurrence of such states as anger, enmity,
disparaging, domineering, envy and avarice. In one of deluded
temperament there is frequent occurrence of such states as stiffness,
torpor, agitation, worry, uncertainty, and holding on tenaciously with
refusal to relinquish.



23\. *Siṅga---*"foppery" is not in PED in this sense. See Vibh 351 and
commentary. *Cāpalya (cāpalla)---"*personal vanity": noun from adj.
*capala.* The word *"capala"* comes in an often-repeated passage:
*"saṭhā māyāvino keṭubhino uddhatā unnalā capalā mukharā ..."* (M I 32);
cf. S I 203; A III 199, etc.) and also M I 470 *"uddhato hoti capalo,"*
with two lines lower *"uddhaccaṃ cāpalyaṃ." Cāpalya* also occurs at Vibh
351 (and M II 167). At M- a I 152 (commenting on M I 32) we find:
*capalā ti pattacīvaramaṇḍanādinā cāpallena yuttā* ("interested in
personal vanity consisting in adorning bowl and robe and so on"), and at
M-a III 185 (commenting on M I 470): *Uddhato hoti capalo ti
uddhaccapakatiko c'eva hoti cīvaramaṇḍanā pattamaṇḍanā  senāsanamaṇḍanā
imassa vā pūtikāyassa kelāyanamaṇḍanā ti evaṃ vuttena
taruṇadārakacāpallena samannāgato* ("'he is distracted---or puffed
up---and personally vain': he is possessed of the callow youth's
personal vanity described as adorning the robe, adorning the bowl,
adorning the lodging, or prizing and adorning this filthy body"). This
meaning is confirmed in the commentary to Vibh 251. PED does not give
this meaning at all but only "fickle," which is unsupported by the
commentary. CPD *(acapala)* also does not give this meaning. As to the
other things listed here in the *Visuddhimagga* text, most will be found
at M I 36. For "holding on tenaciously," etc., see M I 43.



[]



[]



In one of faithful temperament there is frequent occurrence of such
states as free generosity, desire to see Noble Ones, desire to hear the
Good Dhamma, great gladness, ingenuousness, honesty, and trust in things
that inspire trust. In one of intelligent temperament there is frequent
occurrence of such states as readiness to be spoken to, possession of
good friends, knowledge of the right amount in eating, mindfulness and
full awareness, devotion to wakefulness, a sense of urgency about things
that should inspire a sense of urgency, and wisely directed endeavour.
In one of speculative temperament there is frequent occurrence of such
states as talkativeness, sociability, boredom with devotion to the
profitable, failure to finish undertakings, smoking by night and flaming
by day (see M I 144---that is to say, hatching plans at night and
putting them into effect by day), and mental running hither and thither
(see Ud 37).



This is how the temperaments may be recognized by the kind of states
occurring.



[96.]However, these directions for recognizing the temperaments
have not been handed down in their entirety in either the texts or the
commentaries; they are only expressed according to the opinion of the
teachers and cannot therefore be treated as authentic. For even those of
hating temperament can exhibit postures, etc., ascribed to the greedy
temperament when they try diligently. And postures, etc., never arise
with distinct characteristics in a person of mixed temperament. Only
such directions for recognizing temperament as are given in the
commentaries should be treated as authentic; for this is said: "A
teacher who has acquired penetration of minds will know the temperament
and will explain a meditation subject accordingly; one who has not
should question the pupil." So it is by penetration of minds or by
questioning the person, that it can be known whether he is one of greedy
temperament or one of those beginning with hating temperament.



[97.]*What suits one of what kind of temperament*? (§79). A
suitable lodging for one of greedy temperament has an unwashed sill and
stands level with the ground, and it can be either an overhanging \[rock
with an\] unprepared \[drip-ledge\] (see Ch. II, note 15), a grass hut,
or a leaf house, etc. It ought to be spattered with dirt, full of
bats,24 dilapidated, too high or too low, in bleak surroundings,
threatened \[by lions, tigers, etc.,\] with a muddy, uneven path,
\[108\] where even the bed and chair are full of bugs. And it should be
ugly and unsightly, exciting loathing as soon as looked at. Suitable
inner and outer garments are those that have torn-off edges with threads
hanging down all round like a "net cake,"25 harsh to the touch like
hemp, soiled, heavy and hard to wear. And the right kind of bowl for him
is an ugly clay bowl disfigured by stoppings and joints, or a heavy and
misshapen iron bowl as unappetizing as a skull. The right kind of road
for him on which to wander for alms is disagreeable, with no village
near, and uneven. The right kind of village for him in which to wander
for alms is where people wander about as if oblivious of him, where, as
he is about to leave without getting alms even from a single family,
people call him into the sitting hall, saying, "Come, venerable sir,"
and give him



24\. *Jatukā---*"a bat": not in PED. Also at Ch. XI. §7.\



25\. *Jalapūvasadisa---*"like a net cake": "A cake made like a net"
(Vism-mhṭ 108); possibly what is now known in Sri Lanka as a "string
hopper," or something like it.

[]



gruel and rice, but do so as casually as if they were putting a cow in a
pen. Suitable people to serve him are slaves or workmen who are
unsightly, ill-favoured, with dirty clothes, ill-smelling and
disgusting, who serve him his gruel and rice as if they were throwing it
rudely at him. The right kind of gruel and rice and hard food is poor,
unsightly, made up of millet, *kudusaka*, broken rice, etc., stale
buttermilk, sour gruel, curry of old vegetables, or anything at all that
is merely for filling the stomach. The right kind of posture for him is
either standing or walking. The object of his contemplation should be
any of the colour kasiṇas, beginning with the blue, whose colour is not
pure. This is what suits one of greedy temperament.



[98.]A suitable resting place for one of hating temperament is
not too high or too low, provided with shade and water, with
well-proportioned walls, posts and steps, with well-prepared frieze work
and lattice work, brightened with various kinds of painting, with an
even, smooth, soft floor, adorned with festoons of flowers and a canopy
of many-coloured cloth like a Brahmā-god's divine palace, with bed and
chair covered with well-spread clean pretty covers, smelling sweetly of
flowers, and perfumes and scents set about for homely comfort, which
makes one happy and glad at the mere sight of it.



[99.]The right kind of road to his lodging is free from any
sort of danger, traverses clean, even ground, and has been properly
prepared. \[109\] And here it is best that the lodging's furnishings are
not too many in order to avoid hiding-places for insects, bugs, snakes
and rats: even a single bed and chair only. The right kind of inner and
outer garments for him are of any superior stuff such as China cloth,
Somāra cloth, silk, fine cotton, fine linen, of either single or double
thickness, quite light, and well dyed, quite pure in colour to befit an
ascetic. The right kind of bowl is made of iron, as well shaped as a
water bubble, as polished as a gem, spotless, and of quite pure colour
to befit an ascetic. The right kind of road on which to wander for alms
is free from dangers, level, agreeable, with the village neither too far
nor too near. The right kind of village in which to wander for alms is
where people, thinking, "Now our lord is coming," prepare a seat in a
sprinkled, swept place, and going out to meet him, take his bowl, lead
him to the house, seat him on a prepared seat and serve him carefully
with their own hands.



[100.] Suitable people to serve him are handsome, pleasing,
well bathed, well anointed, scented26 with the perfume of incense and
the smell of flowers, adorned with apparel made of variously-dyed clean
pretty cloth, who do their work carefully. The right kind of gruel,
rice, and hard food has colour, smell and taste, possesses nutritive
essence, and is inviting, superior in every way, and enough for his
wants. The right kind of posture for him is lying down or sitting. The
object of his contemplation should be anyone of the colour kasiṇas,
beginning with the blue, whose colour is quite pure. This is what suits
one of hating temperament.



[101.]The right lodging for one of deluded temperament has a
view and is not shut in, where the four quarters are visible to him as
he sits there. As to the postures, walking is right. The right kind of
object for his contemplation is not small, that is to say, the size of a
winnowing basket or the size of a saucer; for his mind becomes more
confused



26\. *Surabhi---*"scented*,* perfume": not in PED; also at VI.90; X.60
and Vism-mhṭ 445.



[]



[]



in a confined space; so the right kind is an amply large kasiṇa. The
rest is as stated for one of hating temperament. This is what suits one
of deluded temperament.



[102.] For one of faithful temperament all the directions given
for one of hating temperament are suitable. As to the object of his
contemplation, one of the recollections is right as well.



For one of intelligent temperament there is nothing unsuitable as far as
concerns



the lodging and so on.



For one of speculative temperament an open lodging with a view, \[110\]
where gardens, groves and ponds, pleasant prospects, panoramas of
villages, towns and countryside, and the blue gleam of mountains, are
visible to him as he sits there, is not right; for that is a condition
for the running hither and thither of applied thought. So he should live
in a lodging such as a deep cavern screened by woods like the
Overhanging Rock of the Elephant's Belly (*Hatthikucchipabbhāra*), or
Mahinda's Cave. Also an ample-sized object of contemplation is not
suitable for him; for one like that is a condition for the running
hither and thither of applied thought. A small one is right. The rest is
as stated for one of greedy temperament. This is what suits one of
speculative temperament.



These are the details, with definition of the kind, source, recognition,
and what is suitable, as regards the various temperaments handed down
here with the words "that suits his own temperament" (§60).



[103.] However, the meditation subject that is suitable to the
temperament has not been cleared up in all its aspects yet. This will
become clear automatically when those in the following list are treated
in detail.



Now, it was said above, "and he should apprehend from among the forty
meditation subjects one that suits his own temperament" (§60). Here the
exposition of the meditation subject should be first understood in these
ten ways: (1) as to enumeration, (2) as to which bring only access and
which absorption, (3) at to the kinds of jhāna, (4) as to surmounting,
(5) as to extension and non-extension, (6) as to object, (7) as to
plane, (8) as to apprehending, (9) as to condition, (10) as to
suitability to temperament.



[104.] *1.* Herein, as to *enumeration*: it was said above,
"from among the forty



meditation subjects" (§28). Herein, the forty meditation subjects are
these:



ten kasiṇas (totalities),\
ten kinds of foulness,\
ten recollections,\
four divine abidings,\
four immaterial states,\
one perception,\
one defining.



[105.] Herein, the ten kasiṇas are these: earth kasiṇa, water
kasiṇa, fire kasiṇa, air kasiṇa, blue kasiṇa, yellow kasiṇa, red kasiṇa,
white kasiṇa, light kasiṇa, and limited-space kasiṇa.27



27\. "*'Kasiṇa'* is in the sense of entirety *(sakalaṭṭhena)"* (M-a III
260). See IV.119.

The ten kinds of foulness are these: the bloated, the livid, the
festering, the cut- up, the gnawed, the scattered, the hacked and
scattered, the bleeding, the worm- infested, and a skeleton.28



The ten kinds of recollection are these: recollection of the Buddha (the
Enlightened One), recollection of the Dhamma (the Law), recollection of
the Sangha (the Community), recollection of virtue, recollection of
generosity, recollection of deities, recollection (or mindfulness) of
death, mindfulness occupied with the body, mindfulness of breathing, and
recollection of peace. \[111\]



The four divine abidings are these: loving-kindness, compassion,
gladness, and



equanimity.



The four immaterial states are these: the base consisting of boundless
space, the base consisting of boundless consciousness, the base
consisting of nothingness, and the base consisting of neither perception
nor non-perception.



The one perception is the perception of repulsiveness in nutriment.



The one defining is the defining of the four elements.



This is how the exposition should be understood "as to enumeration."



[106.] *2 As to which bring access only and which absorption*:
the eight recollections--- excepting mindfulness occupied with the body
and mindfulness of breathing--- the perception of repulsiveness in
nutriment, and the defining of the four elements, are ten meditation
subjects that bring access only. The others bring absorption. This is
"as to which bring access only and which absorption."



[107.] *3. As to the kind of jhāna*: among those that bring
absorption, the ten kasiṇas together with mindfulness of breathing bring
all four jhānas. The ten kinds of foulness together with mindfulness
occupied with the body bring the first jhāna.



28\. Here ten kinds of foulness are given. But in the Suttas only either
five or six of this set appear to be mentioned, that is, "Perception of
a skeleton, perception of the worm- infested, perception of the livid,
perception of the cut-up, perception of the bloated. (see A I 42 and S V
131; A II 17 adds "perception of the festering")" No details are given.
All ten appear at Dhs 263--64 and Paṭis I 49. It will be noted that no
order of progress of decay in the kinds of corpse appears here; also the
instructions in Ch. VI are for contemplating actual corpses in these
states. The primary purpose here is to cultivate "repulsiveness."\
Another set of nine progressive stages in the decay of a corpse, mostly
different from these, is given at M I 58, 89, etc., beginning with a
corpse one day old and ending with bones turned to dust. From the words
"suppose a bhikkhu saw a corpse thrown on a charnel ground ... he
compares this same body of his with it thus, 'This body too is of like
nature, awaits a like fate, is not exempt from that'"(M I 58), it can be
assumed that these nine, which are given in progressive order of decay
in order to demonstrate the body's impermanence, are not necessarily
intended as contemplations of actual corpses so much as mental images to
be created, the primary purpose being to cultivate impermanence. This
may be why these nine are not used here (see VIII.43). The word *asubha*
(foul, foulness) is used both of the contemplations of corpses as here
and of the contemplation of the parts of the body (A V 109).

[]



The first three divine abidings bring three jhānas. The fourth divine
abiding and the four immaterial states bring the fourth jhāna. This is
"as to the kind of jhāna."



[108.] *4. As to surmounting*: there are two kinds of
surmounting, that is to say, surmounting of factors and surmounting of
object. Herein, there is surmounting of factors in the case of all
meditation subjects that bring three and four jhānas because the second
jhāna, etc., have to be reached in those same objects by surmounting the
jhāna factors of applied thought and sustained thought, and so on.
Likewise in the case of the fourth divine abiding; for that has to be
reached by surmounting joy in the same object as that of
loving-kindness, and so on. But in the case of the four immaterial
states there is surmounting of the object; for the base consisting of
boundless space has to be reached by surmounting one or other of the
first nine kasiṇas, and the base consisting of boundless consciousness,
etc., have respectively to be reached by surmounting space, and so on.
With the rest there is no surmounting. This is "as to surmounting."



[109.] *5. As to extension and non-extension*: only the ten
kasiṇas among these forty meditation subjects need be extended. For it
is within just so much space as one is intent upon with the kasiṇa that
one can hear sounds with the divine ear element, see visible objects
with the divine eye, and know the minds of other beings with the mind.



[110.]Mindfulness occupied with the body and the ten kinds of
foulness need not be extended. Why? Because they have a definite
location and because there is no benefit in it. The definiteness of
their location will become clear in explaining the method of development
(VIII.83--138 and VI.40, 41, 79). If the latter are extended, it is only
a quantity of corpses that is extended \[112\] and there is no benefit.
And this is said in answer to the question of Sopāka: "Perception of
visible forms is quite clear, Blessed One, perception of bones is not
clear" (Source untraced29); for here the perception of visible forms is
called "quite clear" in the sense of extension of the sign, while the
perception of bones is called "not quite clear" in the sense of its
non-extension.



[111.] But the words "I was intent upon this whole earth with
the perception of a skeleton" (Th 18) are said of the manner of
appearance to one who has acquired that perception. For just as in \[the
Emperor\] Dhammāsoka's time the *Karavīka* bird uttered a sweet song
when it saw its own reflection in the looking glass walls all round and
perceived *Karavīkas* in every direction,30 so the Elder \[Siṅgāla
Pitar\]



29\. Also quoted in A-a V 79 on AN 11:9. Cf. Sn 1119. A similar
quotation with Sopāka is found in Vism-mhṭ 334--35, see note 1 to XI.2.\



30\. The full story, which occurs at M-a III 382--83 and elsewhere, is
this: "It seems that when the Karavīka bird has pecked a sweet-flavoured
mango wth its beak and savoured the dripping juice, and flapping its
wings, begins to sing, then quadrupeds caper as if mad. Quadrupeds
grazing in their pastures drop the grass in their mouths and listen to
the sound. Beasts of prey hunting small animals pause with one foot
raised. Hunted animals lose their fear of death and halt in their
tracks. Birds flying in the air stay with wings outstretched. Fishes in
the water keep still, not moving their fins. All listen to the sound, so
beautiful is the Karavīka's song. Dhammāsoka's queen Asandhamittā asked
the Community: 'Venerable sirs, is there anything that sounds like the
Buddha?'--- 'The Karavīka birds does.'---'Where are those birds,
venerable sirs?'---'In the Himalaya.'

thought, when he saw the sign appearing in all directions through his
acquisition of the perception of a skeleton, that the whole earth was
covered with bones.



[112.] If that is so, then is what is called "the
measurelessness of the object of jhāna produced on foulness"31
contradicted? It is not contradicted. For one man apprehends the sign in
a large bloated corpse or skeleton, another in a small one. In this way
the jhāna of the one has a limited object and of the other a measureless
object. Or alternatively, "With a measureless object" (Dhs 182--84 in
elision) is said of it referring to one who extends it, seeing no
disadvantage in doing so. But it need not be extended because no benefit
results.



[113.] The rest need not be extended likewise. Why? When a man
extends the sign of in-breaths and out-breaths, only a quantity of wind
is extended, and it has a definite location, \[the nose-tip\]. So it
need not be extended because of the disadvantage and because of the
definiteness of the location. And the divine abidings have living beings
as their object. When a man extends the sign of these, only the quantity
of living beings would be extended, and there is no purpose in that. So
that also need not be extended.



[114.]When it is said, "Intent upon one quarter with his heart
endued with loving- kindness" (D I 250), etc., that is said for the sake
of comprehensive inclusion. For it is when a man develops it
progressively by including living beings in one direction by one house,
by two houses, etc., that he is said to be "intent upon one direction,"
\[113\] not when he extends the sign. And there is no counterpart sign
here that he might extend. Also the state of having a limited or
measureless object can be understood here according to the way of
inclusion, too.



[115.] As regards the immaterial states as object, space need
not be extended since it is the mere removal of the kasiṇa
\[materiality\]; for that should be brought to mind only as the
disappearance of the kasiṇa \[materiality\]; if he extends it, nothing
further happens. And consciousness need not be extended since it is a
state consisting in an individual essence, and it is not possible to
extend a state consisting in an individual essence. The disappearance of
consciousness need not be extended since it is mere non-existence of
consciousness. And the base consisting of neither



She told the king: 'Sire, I wish to hear a Karavīka bird.' The king
dispatched a gold cage with the order, 'Let a Karavīka bird come and sit
in this cage.' The cage travelled and halted in front of a Karavīka.
Thinking, 'The cage has come at the king's command; it is impossible not
to go,' the bird got in. The cage returned and stopped before the king.
They could not get the Karavīka to utter a sound. When the king asked,
'When do they utter a sound?' they replied, 'On seeing their kin.' Then
the king had it surrounded with looking-glasses. Seeing its own
reflection and imagining that its relatives had come, it flapped its
wings and cried out with an exquisite voice as if sounding a crystal
trumpet. All the people in the city rushed about as if mad. Asandhamittā
thought: 'If the sound of this creature is so fine, what indeed can the
sound of the Blessed One have been like since he had reached the glory
of omniscient knowledge?' and arousing a happiness that she never again
relinquished, she became established in the fruition of stream-entry."\

filled in from pp. 37-- 38, §182 and §184.

perception nor non-perception as object need not be extended since it
too is a state consisting in an individual essence.32



[116.] The rest need not be extended because they have no sign.
For it is the counterpart sign33 that would be extendable, and the
object of the recollection of the Buddha, etc., is not a counterpart
sign. Consequently there is no need for extension there.



This is "as to extension and non-extension."



[117.]*6. As to object*: of these forty meditation subjects,
twenty-two have counterpart signs as object, that is to say, the ten
kasiṇas, the ten kinds of foulness, mindfulness of breathing, and
mindfulness occupied with the body; the rest do not have counterpart
signs as object. Then twelve have states consisting in individual
essences as object, that is to say, eight of the ten
recollections---except mindfulness of breathing and mindfulness occupied
with the body---the perception of repulsiveness in nutriment, the
defining of the elements, the base consisting of boundless
consciousness, and the base consisting of neither perception nor
non-perception; and twenty-two have \[counterpart\] signs as object,
that is to say, the ten kasiṇas, the ten kinds of foulness, mindfulness
of breathing, and mindfulness occupied with the body; while the
remaining six have "not-so- classifiable"34 objects. Then eight have
mobile objects in the early stage though the counterpart is stationary,
that is to say, the festering, the bleeding, the worm-infested,
mindfulness of breathing, the water kasiṇa, the fire kasiṇa, the air
kasiṇa, and in the case of the light kasiṇa the object consisting of a
circle of sunlight, etc.; the rest have immobile objects.35 This is "as
to object."



[118.]*7. As to plane*: here the twelve, namely, the ten kinds
of foulness, mindfulness occupied with the body, and perception of
repulsiveness in nutriment, do not occur among deities. These twelve and
mindfulness of breathing do not occur in the

extended, not any other kind, that he said, *'it is not possible to
extend a state consisting in an individual essence'"* (Vism-mhṭ 110).\



33\. The word *"nimitta"* in its technical sense is consistently
rendered here by the word "sign," which corresponds very nearly if not
exactly to most uses of it. It is sometimes rendered by "mark" (which
over-emphasizes the concrete), and by "image" (which is not always
intended). The three kinds, that is, the preliminary-work sign, learning
sign and counterpart sign, do not appear in the Piṭakas. There the use
rather suggests association of ideas as, for example, at M I 180, M I
119, A I 4, etc., than the more definitely visualized "image" in some
instances of the "counterpart sign" described in the following
chapters.\



34\. *Na-vattabba---*"not* * so-classifiable" is an Abhidhamma shorthand
term for something that, when considered under one of the triads or
dyads of the *Abhidhamma Mātikā* (Dhs 1f.), cannot be placed under any
one of the three, or two, headings.



35\. "'*The festering'* is a mobile object because of the oozing of the
pus, *'the bleeding'* because of the trickling of the blood, *'the
worm-infested'* because of the wriggling of the worms. The mobile aspect
of the sunshine coming in through a window opening is evident, which
explains why an object consisting of a circle of sunlight is called
mobile" (Vism-mhṭ 110).

Brahmā-world. But none except the four immaterial states occur in the
immaterial becoming. All occur among human beings. This is "as to
plane." \[114\]



[119.] *8. As to apprehending*: here the exposition should be
understood according to the seen, the touched and the heard. Herein,
these nineteen, that is to say, nine kasiṇas omitting the air kasiṇa and
the ten kinds of foulness, must be apprehended by the seen. The meaning
is that in the early stage their sign must be apprehended by constantly
looking with the eye. In the case of mindfulness occupied with the body
the five parts ending with skin must be apprehended by the seen and the
rest by the heard, so its object must be apprehended by the seen and the
heard. Mindfulness of breathing must be apprehended by the touched; the
air kasiṇa by the seen and the touched; the remaining eighteen by the
heard. The divine abiding of equanimity and the four immaterial states
are not apprehendable by a beginner; but the remaining thirty-five are.
This is "as to apprehending."



[120.]*9. As to condition*: of these meditation subjects nine
kasiṇas omitting the space kasiṇa are conditions for the immaterial
states. The ten kasiṇas are conditions for the kinds of
direct-knowledge. Three divine abidings are conditions for the fourth
divine abiding. Each lower immaterial state is a condition for each
higher one. The base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception
is a condition for the attainment of cessation. All are conditions for
living in bliss, for insight, and for the fortunate kinds of becoming.
This is "as to condition."



[121.]*10. As to suitability to temperament*: here the
exposition should be understood according to what is suitable to the
temperaments. That is to say: first, the ten kinds of foulness and
mindfulness occupied with the body are eleven meditation subjects
suitable for one of greedy temperament. The four divine abidings and
four colour kasiṇas are eight suitable for one of hating temperament.
Mindfulness of breathing is the one \[recollection as a\] meditation
subject suitable for one of deluded temperament and for one of
speculative temperament. The first six recollections are suitable for
one of faithful temperament. Mindfulness of death, the recollection of
peace, the defining of the four elements, and the perception of
repulsiveness in nutriment, are four suitable for one of intelligent
temperament. The remaining kasiṇas and the immaterial states are
suitable for all kinds of temperament. And anyone of the kasiṇas should
be limited for one of speculative temperament and measureless for one of
deluded temperament. This is how the exposition should be understood
here "as to suitability to temperament."



[122.] All this has been stated in the form of direct
opposition and complete suitability. But there is actually no profitable
development that does not suppress greed, etc., and help faith, and so
on. And this is said in the Meghiya Sutta: "\[One\] should, in
addition,36 develop these four things: foulness should be developed for
the purpose of abandoning greed (lust). Loving-kindness should be
developed for



36\. "In addition to the five things" (not quoted) dealt with earlier in
the sutta, namely, perfection of virtue, good friendship, hearing
suitable things, energy, and understanding.

the truths, the dependent origination, etc., which are profound and
associated with voidness" (Vism- mhṭ 111). Cf. M-a II 264, A-a
commentary to AN 4:180.

the purpose of abandoning ill will. \[115\] Mindfulness of breathing
should be developed for the purpose of cutting off applied thought.
Perception of impermanence should be cultivated for the purpose of
eliminating the conceit, 'I am'" (A IV 358). Also in the Rāhula Sutta,
in the passage beginning, "Develop loving-kindness, Rāhula" (M I 424),
seven meditation subjects are given for a single temperament. So instead
of insisting on the mere letter, the intention should be sought in each
instance.



This is the explanatory exposition of the meditation subject referred to
by the



words *he should apprehend*...*one* \[meditation subject\] (§28).



[123.] Now the words *and he should apprehend* are illustrated
as follows. After approaching the good friend of the kind described in
the explanation of the words *then approach the good friend*, *the giver
of a meditation subject* (§28 and §57--73), the meditator should
dedicate himself to the Blessed One, the Enlightened One, or to a
teacher, and he should ask for the meditation subject with a sincere
inclination \[of the heart\] and sincere resolution.



[124.]Herein, he should dedicate himself to the Blessed One,
the Enlightened One, in this way: "Blessed One, I relinquish this my
person to you." For without having thus dedicated himself, when living
in a remote abode he might be unable to stand fast if a frightening
object made its appearance, and he might return to a village abode,
become associated with laymen, take up improper search and come to ruin.
But when he has dedicated himself in this way no fear arises in him if a
frightening object makes its appearance; in fact only joy arises in him
as he reflects: "Have you not wisely already dedicated yourself to the
Enlightened One?"



[125.] Suppose a man had a fine piece of Kāsi cloth. He would
feel grief if it were eaten by rats or moths; but if he gave it to a
bhikkhu needing robes, he would feel only joy if he saw the bhikkhu
tearing it up \[to make his patched cloak\]. And so it is with this.



[126.] When he dedicates himself to a teacher, he should say:
"I relinquish this my person to you, venerable sir." For one who has not
dedicated his person thus becomes unresponsive to correction, hard to
speak to, and unamenable to advice, or he goes where he likes without
asking the teacher. Consequently the teacher does not help him with
either material things or the Dhamma, and he does not train him in the
cryptic books.37 Failing to get these two kinds of help, \[116\] he
finds no footing in the Dispensation, and he soon comes down to
misconducting himself or to the lay state. But if he has dedicated his
person, he is not unresponsive to correction, does not go about as he
likes, is easy to speak to, and lives only in dependence on the teacher.
He gets the twofold help from the teacher and attains growth, increase,
and fulfilment in the Dispensation. Like the Elder Cūḷa-
Piṇḍapātika-Tissa's pupils.



[127.]Three bhikkhus came to the elder, it seems. One of them
said, "Venerable sir, I am ready to fall from a cliff the height of one
hundred men, if it is said to be to your advantage." The second said,
"Venerable sir, I am ready to grind away this body from the heels up
without remainder on a flat stone, if it is said to be to your
advantage." The third said, "Venerable sir, I am ready to die by
stopping breathing,



[]



[]



if it is said to be to your advantage." Observing, "These bhikkhus are
certainly capable of progress," the elder expounded a meditation subject
to them. Following his advice, the three attained Arahantship.



This is the benefit in self-dedication. Hence it was said above
"dedicating himself



to the Blessed One, the Enlightened One, or to a teacher."



[128.] *With a sincere inclination* \[*of the heart*\]  *and
sincere resolution* (§ 123): the meditator's inclination should be
sincere in the six modes beginning with non- greed. For it is one of
such sincere inclination who arrives at one of the three kinds of
enlightenment, according as it is said: "Six kinds of inclination lead
to the maturing of the enlightenment of the Bodhisattas. With the
inclination to non- greed, Bodhisattas see the fault in greed. With the
inclination to non-hate, Bodhisattas see the fault in hate. With the
inclination to non-delusion, Bodhisattas see the fault in delusion. With
the inclination to renunciation, Bodhisattas see the fault in house
life. With the inclination to seclusion, Bodhisattas see the fault in
society. With the inclination to relinquishment, Bodhisattas see the
fault in all kinds of becoming and destiny (*Source untraced*.)" For
stream-enterers, once-returners, non-returners, those with cankers
destroyed (i.e. Arahants), Paccekabuddhas, and Fully Enlightened Ones,
whether past, future or present, all arrive at the distinction peculiar
to each by means of these same six modes. That is why he should have
sincerity of inclination in these six modes.



[129.] He should be whole-heartedly resolved on that. The
meaning is \[117\] that he should be resolved upon concentration,
respect concentration, incline to concentration, be resolved upon
Nibbāna, respect Nibbāna, incline to Nibbāna.



[130.]When, with sincerity of inclination and whole-hearted
resolution in this way, he asks for a meditation subject, then a teacher
who has acquired the penetration of minds can know his temperament by
surveying his mental conduct; and a teacher who has not can know it by
putting such questions to him as: "What is your temperament?" or "What
states are usually present in you?" or "What do you like bringing to
mind?" or "What meditation subject does your mind favour?" When he
knows, he can expound a meditation subject suitable to that temperament.
And in doing so, he can expound it in three ways: it can be expounded to
one who has already learnt the meditation subject by having him recite
it at one or two sessions; it can be expounded to one who lives in the
same place each time he comes; and to one who wants to learn it and then
go elsewhere it can be expounded in such a manner that it is neither too
brief nor too long.



[131.] Herein, when first he is explaining the earth kasiṇa,
there are nine aspects that he should explain. They are the four faults
of the kasiṇa, the making of a kasiṇa, the method of development for one
who has made it, the two kinds of sign, the two kinds of concentration,
the seven kinds of suitable and unsuitable, the ten kinds of skill in
absorption, evenness of energy, and the directions for absorption.



In the case of the other meditation subjects, each should be expounded
in the way appropriate to it. All this will be made clear in the
directions for development. But when the meditation subject is being
expounded in this way, the meditator must apprehend the sign as he
listens.



[]



[]



[132.] *Apprehend the sign* means that he must connect each
aspect thus: "This is the preceding clause, this is the subsequent
clause, this is its meaning, this is its intention, this is the simile."
When he listens attentively, apprehending the sign in this way, his
meditation subject is well apprehended. Then, and because of that, he
successfully attains distinction, but not otherwise. This clarifies the
meaning of the words "and he must apprehend."



[133.]At this point the clauses approach the good friend, the
giver of a meditation subject, and he should apprehend from among the
forty meditation subjects one that suits his own temperament (§28) have
been expounded in detail in all their aspects.



The third chapter called "The Description of Taking a Meditation
Subject" in the Treatise on the Development of Concentration in the
*Path of Purification* composed for the purpose of gladdening good
people.

## CHAPTER IV 


THE EARTH KASIṆA



(*Pathavī-kasiṇa-niddesa*)



[1.] \[118\] Now, it was said earlier: After that he should
avoid a monastery unfavourable to the development of concentration and
go to live in one that is favourable (III.28). In the first place one
who finds it convenient to live with the teacher in the same monastery
can live there while he is making certain of the meditation subject. If
it is inconvenient there, he can live in another monastery--- a suitable
one---a quarter or a half or even a whole league distant. In that case,
when he finds he is in doubt about, or has forgotten, some passage in
the meditation subject, then he should do the duties in the monastery in
good time and set out afterwards, going for alms on the way and arriving
at the teacher's dwelling place after his meal. He should make certain
about the meditation subject that day in the teacher's presence. Next
day, after paying homage to the teacher, he should go for alms on his
way back and so he can return to his own dwelling place without fatigue.
But one who finds no convenient place within even a league should
clarify all difficulties about the meditation subject and make quite
sure it has been properly attended to. Then he can even go far away and,
avoiding a monastery unfavourable to development of concentration, live
in one that is favourable.



\[THE EIGHTEEN FAULTS OF A MONASTERY\]



[2.]Herein, one that is unfavourable has anyone of eighteen
faults. These are: (1) largeness, (2) newness, (3) dilapidatedness, (4)
a nearby road, (5) a pond, (6) \[edible\] leaves, (7) flowers, (8)
fruits, (9) famousness, (10) a nearby city, (11) nearby timber trees,
(12) nearby arable fields, (13) presence of incompatible persons, (14) a
nearby port of entry, (15) nearness to the border countries, (16)
nearness to the frontier of a kingdom, (17) unsuitability, (18) lack of
good friends. \[119\] One with any of these faults is not favourable. He
should not live there. Why?



[3.]Firstly, people with varying aims collect in a
*large monastery*. They conflict with each other and so neglect the
duties. The Enlightenment-tree terrace, etc., remain unswept, the water
for drinking and washing is not set out. So if he thinks, "I shall go to
the alms-resort village for alms" and takes his bowl and robe and sets
out, perhaps he sees that the duties have not been done or that a
drinking-water pot is empty, and so the duty has to be done by him
unexpectedly. Drinking water must be maintained. By not doing it he
would commit a


[]



[]



wrongdoing in the breach of a duty. But if he does it, he loses time. He
arrives too late at the village and gets nothing because the alms giving
is finished. Also, when he goes into retreat, he is distracted by the
loud noises of novices and young bhikkhus, and by acts of the Community
\[being carried out\]. However, he can live in a large monastery where
all the duties are done and where there are none of the other
disturbances.



[4.] *2.* In *a new monastery* there is much new building
activity. People criticize someone who takes no part in it. But he can
live in such a monastery where the bhikkhus say, "Let the venerable one
do the ascetic's duties as much as he likes. We shall see to the
building work."



[5.] In *a dilapidated monastery* there is much
that needs repair. People criticize someone who does not see about the
repairing of at least his own lodging. When he sees to the repairs, his
meditation subject suffers.



[6.] In a monastery with a *nearby road*, by a
main street, visitors keep arriving night and day. He has to give up his
own lodging to those who come late, and he has to go and live at the
root of a tree or on top of a rock. And next day it is the same. So
there is no opportunity \[to practice\] his meditation subject. But he
can live in one where there is no such disturbance by visitors.



[7.] A *pond* is a rock pool. Numbers of people
come there for drinking water. Pupils of city-dwelling elders supported
by the royal family come to do dyeing work. When they ask for vessels,
wood, tubs, etc., \[120\] they must be shown where these things are. So
he is kept all the time on the alert.



[8.] If he goes with his meditation subject to sit
by day where there are many sorts of edible *leaves*, then women
vegetable-gatherers, singing as they pick leaves nearby, endanger his
meditation subject by disturbing it with sounds of the opposite sex.



*7.* And where there are many sorts of *flowering* shrubs in bloom there
is the same danger too.



[9.] Where there are many sorts of *fruits * such
as mangoes, rose-apples and jak-fruits, people who want fruits come and
ask for them, and they get angry if he does not give them any, or they
take them by force. When walking in the monastery in the evening he sees
them and asks, "Why do you do so, lay followers?" they abuse him as they
please and even try to evict him.



[10.] *9.* When he lives in a monastery that is *famous* and
renowned in the world, like Dakkhiṇagiri1 Hatthikucchi, Cetiyagiri or
Cittalapabbata, there are always people coming who want to pay homage to
him, supposing that he is an Arahant, which inconveniences him. But if
it suits him, he can live there at night and go elsewhere by day.



[11.] In one with a *nearby city* objects of the
opposite sex come into focus. Women-pot carriers go by bumping into him
with their jars and giving no room



1\. "They say it is the Dakkhiṇagiri in the Magadha country" (Vism-mhṭ
116). There is mention of a Dakkhiṇagiri-vihāra at M-a II 293 and
elsewhere.

to pass. Also important people spread out carpets in the middle of the
monastery and sit down.



[12.] *11.* One with *nearby timber trees* where there are
timber trees and osiers useful for making framework is inconvenient
because of the wood-gatherers there, like the gatherers of branches and
fruits already mentioned. If there are trees in a monastery, people come
and cut them down to build houses with. When he has come out of his
meditation room in the evening and is walking up and down in the
monastery, if he sees them and asks, "Why do you do so, lay followers?"
they abuse him as they please and even try to evict him.



[13.] People make use of one with *nearby arable
fields*, quite surrounded by fields. They make a threshing floor in the
middle of the monastery itself. They thresh corn there, dry it in the
forecourts,2 and cause great inconvenience. And where there is extensive
property belonging to the Community, the monastery attendants impound
cattle belonging to families and deny the water supply \[to their
crops\]. \[121\] Then people bring an ear of paddy and show it to the
Community saying "Look at your monastery attendants' work." For one
reason or another he has to go to the portals of the king or the king's
ministers. This \[matter of property belonging to the Community\] is
included by \[a monastery that is\] near arable fields.



[14.] *13.*  *Presence of incompatible persons*: where there
are bhikkhus living who are incompatible and mutually hostile, when they
clash and it is protested, "Venerable sirs, do not do so," they exclaim,
"We no longer count now that this refuse-rag wearer has come."



[15.] *14.* One with a nearby water *port of entry* or land
port of entry3 is made inconvenient by people constantly arriving
respectively by ship or by caravan and crowding round, asking for space
or for drinking water or salt.



[16.] In the case of one *near the border
countries*, people have no trust in the Buddha, etc., there.



*16.* In one *near the frontier of a kingdom* there is fear of kings.
For perhaps one king attacks that place, thinking, "It does not submit
to my rule," and the other does likewise, thinking, "It does not submit
to my rule." A bhikkhu lives there when it is conquered by one king and
when it is conquered by the other. Then they suspect him of spying, and
they bring about his undoing.



[17.] *Unsuitability* is that due to the risk of
encountering visible data, etc., of the opposite sex as objects or to
haunting by non-human beings. Here is a story. An elder lived in a
forest, it seems. Then an ogress stood in the door of his leaf hut and
sang. The elder came out and stood in the door. She went to the end of
the walk and sang. The elder went to the end of the walk. She stood in a
chasm a hundred fathoms deep and sang. The elder recoiled. Then she
suddenly

estuary. A *'land port of* *entry'* is one on the edge of a forest and
acts as the gateway on the road of approach to great cities" (Vism-mhṭ
116).

grabbed him saying, "Venerable sir, it is not just one or two of the
likes of you I have eaten."



[18.]  *Lack of good friends*: where it is not
possible to find a good friend as a teacher or the equivalent of a
teacher or a preceptor or the equivalent of a preceptor, the lack of
good friends there is a serious fault.



One that has any of those eighteen faults should be understood as



unfavourable. And this is said in the commentaries:



A large abode, a new abode,\
One tumbling down, one near a road,\
One with a pond, or leaves, or flowers,\
Or fruits, or one that people seek; \[122\]



In cities, among timber, fields,\
Where people quarrel, in a port,\
In border lands, on frontiers,\
Unsuitableness, and no good friend---



These are the eighteen instances\
A wise man needs to recognize\
And give them full as wide a berth\
As any footpad-hunted road.



\[THE FIVE FACTORS OF THE RESTING PLACE\]



[19.]One that has the five factors beginning with "not too far
from and not too near to" the alms resort is called favourable. For this
is said by the Blessed One: "And how has a lodging five factors,
bhikkhus? Here, bhikkhus, (1) a lodging is not too far, not too near,
and has a path for going and coming. (2) It is little frequented by day
with little sound and few voices by night. (3) There is little contact
with gadflies, flies, wind, burning \[sun\] and creeping things. (4) One
who lives in that lodging easily obtains robes, alms food, lodging, and
the requisite of medicine as cure for the sick. (5) In that lodging
there are elder bhikkhus living who are learned, versed in the
scriptures, observers of the Dhamma, observers of the Vinaya, observers
of the Codes, and when from time to time one asks them questions, 'How
is this, venerable sir? What is the meaning of this?' then those
venerable ones reveal the unrevealed, explain the unexplained, and
remove doubt about the many things that raise doubts. This, bhikkhus, is
how a lodging has five factors"(A V 15).



These are the details for the clause, "After that he should avoid a
monastery unfavourable to the development of concentration and go to
live in one that is favourable" (III.28).



\[THE  LESSER  IMPEDIMENTS\]



[20.] *Then he should sever the lesser impediments* (III.28):
one living in such a favourable monastery should sever any minor
impediments that he may still have, that is to say, long head hair,
nails, and body hair should be cut, mending and patching of old robes
should be done, or those that are soiled should be



[]



[]



dyed. If there is a stain on the bowl, the bowl should be baked. The
bed, chair, etc., should be cleaned up. These are the details for the
clause, "Then he should sever the lesser impediments."



\[DETAILED  INSTRUCTIONS  FOR  DEVELOPMENT\]



[21.] Now, with the clause, *And not overlook any of the
directions for development* (III.28), the time has come for the detailed
exposition of all meditation subjects, starting with the earth kasiṇa.



\[THE EARTH KASIṆA\]



\[123\] When a bhikkhu has thus severed the lesser impediments, then, on
his return from his alms round after his meal and after he has got rid
of drowsiness due to the meal, he should sit down comfortably in a
secluded place and apprehend the sign in earth that is either made up or
not made up.



[22.] For this is said:4 "One who is learning the earth kasiṇa
apprehends the sign in earth that is either made up or not made up; that
is bounded, not unbounded; limited, not unlimited; with a periphery, not
without a periphery; circumscribed, not uncircumscribed; either the size
of a bushel (*suppa*) or the size of a saucer (*sarāva*). He sees to it
that that sign is well apprehended, well attended to, well defined.
Having done that, and seeing its advantages and perceiving it as a
treasure, building up respect for it, making it dear to him, he anchors
his mind to that object, thinking, 'Surely in this way I shall be freed
from aging and death.' Secluded from sense desires ... he enters upon
and dwells in the first jhāna ..."



4\. "Said in the Old Commentary. *'One who is learning the earth
kasiṇa':* one who is apprehending, grasping, an earth kasiṇa as a
'learning sign'. The meaning is, one who is producing an earth kasiṇa
that has become the sign of learning; and here 'arousing' should be
regarded as the establishing of the sign in that way. *'In earth':* in
an earth disk of the kind about to be described. *'Apprehends the
sign':* he apprehends in that, with knowledge connected with meditative
development, the sign of earth of the kind about to be described, as one
does with the eye the sign of the face in a looking-glass. *'Made up':*
prepared in the manner about to be described. *'Not made up':* in a disk
of earth consisting of an ordinary threshing-floor disk, and so on.
*'Bounded':* only in one that has bounds. As regard the words *'the size
of a bushel',* etc., it would be desirable that a bushel and a saucer
were of equal size, but some say that *'the size of a saucer'* is a span
and four fingers, and the *'the size of a bushel'* is larger than that.
*'He sees to it that that sign is well apprehended':* that meditator
makes that disk of earth a well-apprehended sign. When, after
apprehending the sign in it by opening the eyes, and looking and then
closing them again, it appears to him as he adverts to it just as it did
at the moment of looking with open eyes, then he has made it well
apprehended. Having thoroughly established his mindfulness there,
observing it again and again with his mind not straying outside, he sees
that it is *'well attended to'.* When it is well attended to thus by
adverting and attending again and again by producing much repetition and
development instigated by that, he sees that it is *'well defined'. 'To
that object':* to that object called earth kasiṇa, which has appeared
rightly owing to its having been well apprehended.  *'He anchors his
mind':* by bringing his own mind to access jhāna he anchors it, keeps it
from other objects" (Vism-mhṭ 119).



[]



[]



[23.] Herein, when in a previous becoming a man has gone forth
into homelessness in the Dispensation or \[outside it\] with the rishis'
going forth and has already produced the jhāna tetrad or pentad on the
earth kasiṇa, and so has such merit and the support \[of past practice
of jhāna\] as well, then the sign arises in him on earth that is not
made up, that is to say, on a ploughed area or on a threshing floor, as
in the Elder Mallaka's case.



It seems that while that venerable one was looking at a ploughed area
the sign arose in him the size of that area. He extended it and attained
the jhāna pentad. Then by establishing insight with the jhāna as the
basis for it, he reached Arahantship.



\[MAKING AN EARTH KASIṆA\]



[24.] But when a man has had no such previous practice, he
should make a kasiṇa, guarding against the four faults of a kasiṇa and
not overlooking any of the directions for the meditation subject learnt
from the teacher. Now, the four faults of the earth kasiṇa are due to
the intrusion of blue, yellow, red or white. So instead of using clay of
such colours, he should make the kasiṇa of clay like that in the stream
of the Gangā,5 which is the colour of the dawn. \[124\] And he should
make it not in the middle of the monastery in a place where novices,
etc., are about but on the confines of the monastery in a screened
place, either under an overhanging rock or in a leaf hut. He can make it
either portable or as a fixture.



[25.]Of these, a portable one should be made by tying rags of
leather or matting onto four sticks and smearing thereon a disk of the
size already mentioned, using clay picked clean of grass, roots, gravel,
and sand, and well kneaded. At the time of the preliminary work it
should be laid on the ground and looked at.



A fixture should be made by knocking stakes into the ground in the form
of a lotus calyx, lacing them over with creepers. If the clay is
insufficient, then other clay should be put underneath and a disk a span
and four fingers across made on top of that with the quite pure
dawn-coloured clay. For it was with reference only to measurement that
it was said above *either the size of a bushel or the size of a saucer*
(§22). But *that is bounded, not unbounded* was said to show its
delimitedness.



[26.] So, having thus made it delimited and of the size
prescribed, he should scrape it down with a stone trowel---a wooden
trowel turns it a bad colour, so that should not be employed---and make
it as even as the surface of a drum. Then he should sweep the place out
and have a bath. On his return he should seat himself on a well-covered
chair with legs a span and four fingers high, prepared in a place that
is two and a half cubits \[that is, two and a half times elbow to
finger-tip\] from the kasiṇa disk. For the kasiṇa does not appear
plainly to him if he sits further off than that; and if he sits nearer
than that, faults in the



5\. *"Gaṅgā* (= 'river') is the name for the Ganges in India and for the
Mahavaeligaṅgā, Sri Lanka's principal river. However, in the Island of
Sri Lanka there is a river, it seems, called the Rāvanagaṅgā. The clay
in the places where the banks are cut away by its stream is the colour
of dawn" (Vism-mhṭ 119).

[]



kasiṇa appear. If he sits higher up, he has to look at it with his neck
bent; and if he sits lower down, his knees ache.



\[STARTING  CONTEMPLATION\]



[27.]So, after seating himself in the way stated, he should
review the dangers in sense desires in the way beginning, "Sense desires
give little enjoyment" (M I 91) and arouse longing for the escape from
sense desires, for the renunciation that is the means to the surmounting
of all suffering. He should next arouse joy of happiness by recollecting
the special qualities of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha; then
awe by thinking, "Now, this is the way of renunciation entered upon by
all Buddhas, Paccekabuddhas and noble disciples"; and then eagerness by
thinking, "In this way I shall surely come to know the taste of the
bliss of seclusion." \[125\] After that he should open his eyes
moderately, apprehend the sign, and so proceed to develop it.6



[28.]If he opens his eyes too wide, they get fatigued and the
disk becomes too obvious, which prevents the sign becoming apparent to
him. If he opens them too little, the disk is not obvious enough, and
his mind becomes drowsy, which also prevents the sign becoming apparent
to him. So he should develop it by apprehending the sign (*nimitta*),
keeping his eyes open moderately, as if he were seeing the reflection of
his face (*mukha-nimitta*) on the surface of a looking- glass.7



[29.]The colour should not be reviewed. The characteristic
should not be given attention.8 But rather, while not ignoring the
colour, attention should be given



6\. *"'Apprehend the sign':* apprehend with the mind the sign
apprehended by the eye in the earth kasiṇa. *'And develop it':* the
apprehending of the sign as it occurs should be continued intensively
and constantly practiced" (Vism-mhṭ 120).



7\. "Just as one who sees his reflection *(mukha-nimitta---*lit*.*
"face-sign") on the surface of a looking-glass does not open his eyes
too widely or too little (in order to get the effect), nor does he
review the colour of the looking-glass or give attention to its
characteristic, but rather looks with moderately opened eyes and sees
only the sign of his face, so too this meditator looks with moderately
opened eyes at the earth kasiṇa and is occupied only with the sign"
(Vism-mhṭ 121).\



8\. "The dawn colour that is there in the kasiṇa should not be thought
about, though it cannot be denied that it is apprehended by
eye-consciousness. That is why, instead of saying here, 'should not be
looked at,' he says that it should not be apprehended by reviewing. Also
the earth element's characteristic of hardness, which is there, should
not be given attention because the apprehension has to be done through
the channel of seeing. And after saying, 'while not ignoring the colour'
he said, 'relegating the colour to the position of a property of the
physical support,' showing that here the concern is not with the colour,
which is the channel, but rather that this colour should be treated as
an accessory of the physical support; the meaning is that the kasiṇa
(disk) should be given attention with awareness of both the accompanying
earth- aspect and its ancillary colour-aspect, but taking the
earth-aspect with its ancillary concomitant colour as both supported
equally by that physical support \[the disk\]. 'On the concept as the
mental datum since that is what is outstanding': the term of ordinary
usage 'earth' (*pathavī*) as applied to earth with its accessories,
since the prominence of



[]



[]



by setting the mind on the \[name\] concept as the most outstanding
mental datum, relegating the colour to the position of a property of its
physical support. That \[conceptual state\] can be called by anyone he
likes among the names for earth (*pathavī*) such as "earth" (*pathavī*),
"the Great One" (*mahī*), "the Friendly One" (*medinī*), "ground"
(*bhūmi*), "the Provider of Wealth" (*vasudhā*), "the Bearer of Wealth"
(*vasudharā*), etc., whichever suits his manner of perception. Still
"earth" is also a name that is obvious, so it can be developed with the
obvious one by saying "earth, earth." It should be adverted to now with
eyes open, now with eyes shut. And he should go on developing it in this
way a hundred times, a thousand times, and even more than that, until
the learning sign arises.



[30.] When, while he is developing it in this way, it comes
into focus9 as he adverts with his eyes shut exactly as it does with his
eyes open, then the learning sign is said to have been produced. After
its production he should no longer sit in that place;10** ** he should
return to his own quarters and go on developing it sitting there. But in
order to avoid the delay of foot washing, a pair of single- soled
sandals and a walking stick are desirable. Then if the new concentration
vanishes through some unsuitable encounter, he can put his sandals on,
take his walking stick, and go back to the place to re-apprehend the
sign there. When he returns he should seat himself comfortably and
develop it by reiterated reaction to it and by striking at it with
thought and applied thought.



\[THE COUNTERPART SIGN\]



[31.] As he does so, the hindrances eventually become
suppressed, the defilements subside, the mind becomes concentrated with
access concentration, and the counterpart sign arises.



The difference between the earlier learning sign and the counterpart
sign is this. In the learning sign any fault in the kasiṇa is apparent.
But the counterpart sign \[126\] appears as if breaking out from the
learning sign, and a hundred times, a thousand times more purified, like
a looking-glass disk drawn from its case, like a mother-of-pearl dish
well washed, like the moon's disk coming out from behind a cloud, like
cranes against a thunder cloud. But it has neither colour nor shape; for
if it had, it would be cognizable by the eye, gross, susceptible of
comprehension \[by insight---(see XX.2f.)\] and stamped with the three
characteristics.11** ** But it is not like that. For it is born only of
perception in one who has obtained concentration, being a mere mode of
appearance.12 But as



its individual effect is due to outstandingness of the earth element:
'setting the mind' on that mental datum consisting of a \[name-\]
concept (*paññatti-dhamma*), the kasiṇa should be given attention as
'earth, earth.'---If the mind is to be set on a mere concept by means of
a term of common usage, ought earth to be given attention by means of
different names?---It can be. What is wrong? It is to show that that is
done he said, '*Mahī, medinī*,' and so on" (Vism-mhṭ 122).\



9\. *"*'*Comes into focus':* becomes the resort of mind-door impulsion"
(Vism-mhṭ 122).



10\. "Why should he not? If, after the learning sign was produced, he
went on developing it by looking at the disk of the earth, there would
be no arising of the counterpart sign" (Vism-mhṭ 122).



[]



[]



soon as it arises the hindrances are quite suppressed, the defilements
subside, and the mind becomes concentrated in access concentration.



\[THE TWO KINDS OF CONCENTRATION\]



[32.]Now, concentration is of two kinds, that is to say, access
concentration and absorption concentration: the mind becomes
concentrated in two ways, that is, on the plane of access and on the
plane of obtainment. Herein, the mind becomes concentrated on the plane
of access by the abandonment of the hindrances, and on the plane of
obtainment by the manifestation of the jhāna factors.



[33.]The difference between the two kinds of concentration is
this. The factors are not strong in access. It is because they are not
strong that when access has arisen, the mind now makes the sign its
object and now re-enters the life- continuum,13 just as when a young
child is lifted up and stood on its feet, it



11\. "Stamped with the three characteristics of the formed beginning
with rise (see A I 152), or marked with the three characteristics
beginning with impermanence" (Vism- mhṭ 122).\



12\. "If 'it is not like that'---is not possessed of colour, etc.---then
how is it the object of jhāna? It is in order to answer that question
that the sentence beginning, 'For it is ...' is given. 'Born of the
perception': produced by the perception during development, simply born
from the perception during development. Since there is no arising from
anywhere of what has no individual essence, he therefore said, 'Being
the mere mode of appearance'" (Vism-mhṭ 122). See Ch. VIII, n. 11.\



13\. *Bhavaṅga* (life-continuum, lit. "constituent of becoming") and
*javana* (impulsion) are first mentioned in this work at I.57 (see n.
16); this is the second mention. The "cognitive series" *(citta-vīthi) *
so extensively used here is unknown as such in the Piṭakas. Perhaps the
seed from which it sprang may exist in, say, such passages as: "Due to
eye and to visible data eye-consciousness arises. The coincidence of the
three is contact. With contact as condition there is feeling. What he
feels he perceives. What he perceives he thinks about4. What he thinks
about he diversifies \[by means of craving, pride and false view\] ...
Due to mind and to mental data ..." (M I 111). And: "Is the eye
permanent or impermanent ... Are visible objects permanent or
impermanent? ... Is the mind permanent or impermanent? Are mental data
... Is mind-consciousness ... Is mind-contact ... Is any feeling, any
perception, any formation, any consciousness, that arises with
mind-contact as condition permanent or impermanent?" (M III 279). And:
"These five faculties \[of eye, etc.\] each with its separate objective
field and no one of them experiencing as its objective field the
province of any other, have mind as their refuge, and mind experiences
their provinces as its objective field" (M I 295). This treatment of
consciousness implies, as it were, more than even a "double thickness"
of consciousness. An already-formed nucleus of the cognitive series,
based on such Sutta Piṭakas material, appears in the Abhidhamma Piṭakas.
The following two quotations show how the commentary (bracketed italics)
expands the Abhidhamma Piṭakas treatment.\
(i) "Herein, what is eye-consciousness element? Due to eye and to
visible data (*as* *support condition, and to functional mind element*
(= *5-door adverting*),  *as disappearance\
condition, and to the remaining three immaterial aggregates as
conascence condition*) there arises consciousness ... which is
eye-consciousness element. \[Similarly with the other four sense
elements.\] Herein, what is mind element? Eye-consciousness having
arisen

[]



repeatedly falls down on the ground. But the factors are strong in
absorption. It is because they are strong that when absorption
concentration has arisen, the mind, having once interrupted the flow of
the life-continuum, carries on with a stream of profitable impulsion for
a whole night and for a whole day, just as a healthy man, after rising
from his seat, could stand for a whole day.



\[GUARDING THE SIGN\]



[34.] The arousing of the counterpart sign, which arises
together with access concentration, is very difficult. Therefore if he
is able to arrive at absorption in that same session by extending the
sign, it is good. If not, then he must guard the sign diligently as if
it were the foetus of a Wheel-turning Monarch (World-ruler).



and ceased, next to that there arises consciousness ... which is
appropriate (profitable or unprofitable) mind element (in the mode of
receiving). \[Similarly with the other four sense elements.\] Or else it
is the first reaction to any mental datum (to be taken as functional
mind element in the mode of mind-door adverting). Herein, what is
mind-consciousness element? Eye-consciousness having arisen and ceased,
next to that there arises mind element. (Resultant) mind element having
arisen and ceased, also (next to that there arises resultant
mind-consciousness element in the mode of investigating; and that having
arisen and ceased, next to that there arises functional
mind-consciousness element in the mode of determining; and that having
arisen and ceased) next to that there arises consciousness ... which is
appropriate mind- consciousness element (in the mode of impulsion).
\[Similarly with the other four sense elements.\] Due to
(life-continuum) mind and to mental data there arises consciousness ...
which is appropriate (impulsion) mind-consciousness element (following
on the above-mentioned mind-door adverting)" (Vibh 87--90 and Vibh-a
81f.).\
(ii) "Eye-consciousness and its associated states are a condition, as
proximity condition, for *(resultant)* mind element and for its
associated states. Mind element and its associated states are a
condition, as proximity condition, for *(root-causeless resultant)*
mind-consciousness element *(in the mode of investigating)* and for its
associated states. *(Next to that, the mind-consciousness elements
severally in the modes of determining, impulsion, registration, and
life-continuum should be mentioned, though they are not, since the
teaching is abbreviated.)* \[Similarly for the other four senses and
mind-consciousness element\]. Preceding profitable *(impulsion)* states
are a condition, as proximity condition, for subsequent indeterminate
*(registration, life-continuum)* states \[etc.\]" (Paṭṭh II, and Comy.,
33--34).\
The form that the two kinds (5-door and mind-door) of the cognitive
series take is shown in Table V. The following are some Piṭakas
references for the individual modes: *bhavaṅga* (life-continuum): Paṭṭh
I 159, 160, 169, 324; *āvajjana* (adverting) Paṭṭh I 159, 160, 169, 324;
*sampaṭicchana * (receiving),  *santīraṇa * (investigating), 
*voṭṭhapana* (determining), and *tadārammaṇa* (registration) appear only
in the Commentaries. *Javana* (impulsion): Paṭis II 73, 76. The
following references may also be noted here: *anuloma* (conformity),
Paṭṭh I 325. *Cuti-citta* (death consciousness), Paṭṭh I 324.
*Paṭisandhi* (rebirth- linking), Vism-mhṭ 1, 320, etc.; Paṭis II 72,

So guard the sign, nor count the cost,\
And what is gained will not be lost;\
Who fails to have this guard maintained\
Will lose each time what he has gained. \[127\]



[35.]Herein, the way of guarding it is this:



\(1\) Abode, (2) resort, (3) and speech, (4) and person,\
(5) The food, (6) the climate, (7) and the posture---\
Eschew these seven different kinds



Whenever found unsuitable.\
But cultivate the suitable;\
For one perchance so doing finds\
He need not wait too long until\
Absorption shall his wish fulfil.



[36.]*1. * Herein, an *abode * is unsuitable if, while he lives
in it, the unarisen sign does not arise in him or is lost when it
arises, and where unestablished mindfulness fails to become established
and the unconcentrated mind fails to become concentrated. That is
suitable in which the sign arises and becomes confirmed, in which
mindfulness becomes established and the mind becomes concentrated, as in
the Elder Padhāniya-Tissa, resident at Nāgapabbata. So if a monastery
has many abodes he can try them one by one, living in each for three
days, and stay on where his mind becomes unified. For it was due to
suitability of abode that five hundred bhikkhus reached Arahantship
while still dwelling in the Lesser Nāga Cave (*Cūḷa-nāga-leṇa*) in
Tambapaṇṇi Island (Sri Lanka) after apprehending their meditation
subject there. There is no counting the stream- enterers who have
reached Arahantship there after reaching the noble plane elsewhere; so
too in the monastery of Cittalapabbata, and others.



[37.] *2.* An alms-*resort* village lying to the north or south
of the lodging, not too far, within one *kosa* and a half, and where
alms food is easily obtained, is suitable. The opposite kind is
unsuitable.14



[38.]*3. Speech*: that included in the thirty-two kinds of
aimless talk is unsuitable; for it leads to the disappearance of the
sign. But talk based on the ten examples of talk is suitable, though
even that should be discussed with moderation.15



[39.] *4.*  *Person*: one not given to aimless talk, who has
the special qualities of virtue, etc., by acquaintanceship with whom the
unconcentrated mind becomes concentrated, or the concentrated mind
becomes more so, is suitable. One who is much concerned with his body,16
who is addicted to aimless talk, is unsuitable; for he only creates
disturbances, like muddy water added to clear water. And it



14\. North or south to avoid facing the rising sun in coming or going.
*Kosa* is not in PED; "one and a half *kosa* = 3,000 bows" (Vism-mhṭ
123).\



15\. Twenty-six kinds of "aimless" (lit. "animal") talk are given in the
Suttas (e.g. M II 1; III 113), which the commentary increases to
thirty-two (M-a III 233). The ten instances of talk are those given in
the Suttas (e.g. M I 145; III 113). See Ch. I, n.12.



16\. "One who is occupied with exercising and caring for the body"
(Vism-mhṭ 124).

was owing to one such as this that the attainments of the young bhikkhu
who lived at Koṭapabbata vanished, not to mention the sign. \[128\]



[40.] *5.* *Food*: Sweet food suits one, sour food another.



*6.* *Climate*: a cool climate suits one, a warm one another. So when he
finds that by using certain food or by living in a certain climate he is
comfortable, or his unconcentrated mind becomes concentrated, or his
concentrated mind becomes more so, then that food or that climate is
suitable. Any other food or climate is unsuitable.



[41.] *7.*  *Postures*: walking suits one; standing or sitting
or lying down suits another. So he should try them, like the abode, for
three days each, and that posture is suitable in which his
unconcentrated mind becomes concentrated or his concentrated mind
becomes more so. Any other should be understood as unsuitable.



So he should avoid the seven unsuitable kinds and cultivate the
suitable. For when he practices in this way, assiduously cultivating the
sign, then, "he need not wait too long until absorption shall his wish
fulfil."



\[THE TEN KINDS OF SKILL IN ABSORPTION\]



[42.]However, if this does not happen while he is practicing in
this way, then he should have recourse to the ten kinds of skill in
absorption. Here is the method. Skill in absorption needs \[to be dealt
with in\] ten aspects: (1) making the basis clean, (2) maintaining
balanced faculties, (3) skill in the sign, (4) he exerts the mind on an
occasion when it should be exerted, (5) he restrains the mind on an
occasion when it should be restrained, (6) he encourages the mind on an
occasion when it should be encouraged, (7) he looks on at the mind with
equanimity when it should be looked on at with equanimity, (8) avoidance
of unconcentrated persons, (9) cultivation of concentrated persons, (10)
resoluteness upon that (concentration).



[43.]*1. * Herein,  *making the basis clean* is cleansing the
internal and the external basis. For when his head hair, nails and body
hair are long, or when the body is soaked with sweat, then the internal
basis is unclean and unpurified. But when an old dirty smelly robe is
worn or when the lodging is dirty, then the external basis is unclean
and unpurified. \[129\] When the internal and external bases are
unclean, then the knowledge in the consciousness and consciousness-
concomitants that arise is unpurified, like the light of a lamp's flame
that arises with an unpurified lamp-bowl, wick and oil as its support;
formations do not become evident to one who tries to comprehend them
with unpurified knowledge, and when he devotes himself to his meditation
subject, it does not come to growth, increase and fulfilment.



[44.]But when the internal and external bases are clean, then
the knowledge in the consciousness and consciousness-concomitants that
arise is clean and purified, like the light of a lamp's flame that
arises with a purified lamp bowl, wick and oil as its support;
formations become evident to one who tries to comprehend them with
purified knowledge, and as he devotes himself to his meditation subject,
it comes to growth, increase and fulfilment.

[45.] *2.* *Maintaining balanced faculties* is equalizing the
\[five\] faculties of faith and the rest. For if his faith faculty is
strong and the others weak, then the energy faculty cannot perform its
function of exerting, the mindfulness faculty its function of
establishing, the concentration faculty its function of not distracting,
and the understanding faculty its function of seeing. So in that case
the faith faculty should be modified either by reviewing the individual
essences of the states \[concerned, that is, the objects of attention\]
or by not giving \[them\] attention in the way in which the faith
faculty became too strong. And this is illustrated by the story of the
Elder Vakkali (S III 119).



[46.]Then if the energy faculty is too strong, the faith
faculty cannot perform its function of resolving, nor can the rest of
the faculties perform their several functions. So in that case the
energy faculty should be modified by developing tranquillity, and so on.
And this should be illustrated by the story of the Elder Soṇa (Vin I
179--85; A III 374--76). So too with the rest; for it should be
understood that when anyone of them is too strong the others cannot
perform their several functions.



[47.] However, what is particularly recommended is balancing
faith with understanding, and concentration with energy. For one strong
in faith and weak in understanding has confidence uncritically and
groundlessly. One strong in understanding and weak in faith errs on the
side of cunning and is as hard to cure as one sick of a disease caused
by medicine. With the balancing of the two a man has confidence only
when there are grounds for it.



Then idleness overpowers one strong in concentration and weak in energy,
since concentration favours idleness. \[130\] Agitation overpowers one
strong in energy and weak in concentration, since energy favours
agitation. But concentration coupled with energy cannot lapse into
idleness, and energy coupled with concentration cannot lapse into
agitation. So these two should be balanced; for absorption comes with
the balancing of the two.



[48.] Again, \[concentration and faith should be balanced\].
One working on concentration needs strong faith, since it is with such
faith and confidence that he reaches absorption. Then there is
\[balancing of\] concentration and understanding. One working on
concentration needs strong unification, since that is how he reaches
absorption; and one working on insight needs strong understanding, since
that is how he reaches penetration of characteristics; but with the
balancing of the two he reaches absorption as well.



[49.] Strong mindfulness, however, is needed in all instances;
for mindfulness protects the mind from lapsing into agitation through
faith, energy and understanding, which favour agitation, and from
lapsing into idleness through concentration, which favours idleness. So
it is as desirable in all instances as a seasoning of salt in all
sauces, as a prime minister in all the king's business. Hence it is said
\[in the commentaries (D-a 788, M-a I 292, etc)\]: "And mindfulness has
been called universal by the Blessed One. For what reason? Because the
mind has mindfulness as its refuge, and mindfulness is manifested as
protection, and there is no exertion and restraint of the mind without
mindfulness."



[]



[]



[50.] *3.*  *Skill in the sign* is skill in producing the as
yet unproduced sign of unification of mind through the earth kasiṇa,
etc.; and it is skill in developing \[the sign\] when produced, and
skill in protecting \[the sign\] when obtained by development. The last
is what is intended here.



[51.] *4.* How does he *exert the mind on an occasion when it
should be exerted*? When his mind is slack with over-laxness of energy,
etc., then, instead of developing the three enlightenment factors
beginning with tranquillity, he should develop those beginning with
investigation-of-states. For this is said by the Blessed One: "Bhikkhus,
suppose a man wanted to make a small fire burn up, and he put wet grass
on it, put wet cow-dung on it, put wet sticks on it, sprinkled it with
water, and scattered dust on it, would that man be able to make the
small fire burn up?" \[131\]---"No, venerable sir."---"So too, bhikkhus,
when the mind is slack, that is not the time to develop the tranquillity
enlightenment factor, the concentration enlightenment factor or the
equanimity enlightenment factor. Why is that? Because a slack mind
cannot well be roused by those states. When the mind is slack, that is
the time to develop the investigation-of-states enlightenment factor,
the energy enlightenment factor and the happiness enlightenment factor.
Why is that? Because a slack mind can well be roused by those states.



"Bhikkhus, suppose a man wanted to make a small fire burn up, and he put
dry grass on it, put dry cow-dung on it, put dry sticks on it, blew on
it with his mouth, and did not scatter dust on it, would that man be
able to make that small fire burn up?"---"Yes, venerable sir" (S V 112).



[52.] And here the development of the investigation-of-states
enlightenment factor, etc., should be understood as the nutriment for
each one respectively, for this is said: "Bhikkhus, there are profitable
and unprofitable states, reprehensible and blameless states, inferior
and superior states, dark and bright states the counterpart of each
other. Wise attention much practiced therein is the nutriment for the
arising of the unarisen investigation-of-states enlightenment factor, or
leads to the growth, fulfilment, development and perfection of the
arisen investigation-of-states enlightenment factor." Likewise:
"Bhikkhus there is the element of initiative, the element of launching,
and the element of persistence. Wise attention much practiced therein is
the nutriment for the arising of the unarisen energy enlightenment
factor, or leads to the growth, fulfilment, development and perfection
of the arisen energy enlightenment factors." Likewise: "Bhikkhus, there
are states productive of the happiness enlightenment factor. Wise
attention much practiced therein is the nutriment for the arising of the
unarisen happiness enlightenment factor, or leads to the growth,
fulfilment, development and perfection of the arisen happiness
enlightenment factor" (S V 104). \[132\]



[53.] Herein,  *wise attention given to the profitable*, etc.,
is attention occurring in penetration of individual essences and of
\[the three\] general characteristics. *Wise attention given to the
element of initiative*, etc., is attention occurring in the arousing of
the element of initiative, and so on. Herein, initial energy is called
the  *element of initiative*. The *element of launching* is stronger
than that because it launches out from idleness. *The element of
persistence* is still stronger than that



[]



[]



because it goes on persisting in successive later stages. *States
productive of the happiness enlightenment factor* is a name for
happiness itself; and attention that arouses that is *wise attention*.



[54.]There are, besides, seven things that lead to the arising
of the investigation- of-states enlightenment factor: (i) asking
questions, (ii) making the basis clean, (iii) balancing the faculties,
(iv) avoidance of persons without understanding, (v) cultivation of
persons with understanding, (vi) reviewing the field for the exercise of
profound knowledge, (vii) resoluteness upon that \[investigation of
states\].



[55.] Eleven things lead to the arising of the energy
enlightenment factor: (i) reviewing the fearfulness of the states of
loss such as the hell realms, etc., (ii) seeing benefit in obtaining the
mundane and supramundane distinctions dependent on energy, (iii)
reviewing the course of the journey \[to be travelled\] thus: "The path
taken by the Buddhas, Paccekabuddhas, and the great disciples has to be
taken by me, and it cannot be taken by an idler," (iv) being a credit to
the alms food by producing great fruit for the givers, (v) reviewing the
greatness of the Master thus: "My Master praises the energetic, and this
unsurpassable Dispensation that is so helpful to us is honoured in the
practice, not otherwise," (vi) reviewing the greatness of the heritage
thus: "It is the great heritage called the Good Dhamma that is to be
acquired by me, and it cannot be acquired by an idler," (vii) removing
stiffness and torpor by attention to perception of light, change of
postures, frequenting the open air, etc., (viii) avoidance of idle
persons, (ix) cultivation of energetic persons, (x) reviewing the right
endeavours, (xi) resoluteness upon that \[energy\].



[56.] Eleven things lead to the arising of the happiness
enlightenment factor: the recollections (i) of the Buddha, (ii) of the
Dhamma, (iii) of the Sangha, (iv) of virtue, (v) of generosity, and (vi)
of deities, (vii) the recollection of peace, \[133\] (viii) avoidance of
rough persons, (ix) cultivation of refined persons, (x) reviewing
encouraging discourses, (xi) resoluteness upon that \[happiness\].



So by arousing these things in these ways he develops the
investigation-of- states enlightenment factor, and the others. This is
how he exerts the mind on an occasion when it should be exerted.



[57.] *5.* How does he *restrain the mind on an occasion when
it should be restrained*? When his mind is agitated through
over-energeticness, etc., then, instead of developing the three
enlightenment factors beginning with investigation-of- states, he should
develop those beginning with tranquillity; for this is said by the
Blessed One: "Bhikkhus, suppose a man wanted to extinguish a great mass
of fire, and he put dry grass on it ... and did not scatter dust on it,
would that man be able to extinguish that great mass of fire?"---"No,
venerable sir."---"So too, bhikkhus, when the mind is agitated, that is
not the time to develop the investigation-of-states enlightenment
factor, the energy enlightenment factor or the happiness enlightenment
factor. Why is that? Because an agitated mind cannot well be quieted by
those states. When the mind is agitated, that is the time to develop the
tranquillity enlightenment factor, the concentration enlightenment



[]



[]



factor and the equanimity enlightenment factor. Why is that? Because an
agitated mind can well be quieted by those states."



"Bhikkhus, suppose a man wanted to extinguish a great mass of fire, and
he put wet grass on it ... and scattered dust on it, would that man be
able to extinguish that great mass of fire?"---"Yes, venerable sir" (S V
114).



[58.] And here the development of the tranquillity
enlightenment factor, etc., should be understood as the nutriment for
each one respectively, for this is said: "Bhikkhus, there is bodily
tranquillity and mental tranquillity. \[134\] Wise attention much
practiced therein is the nutriment for the arising of the unarisen
tranquillity enlightenment factor, or leads to the growth, fulfilment,
development and perfection of the arisen tranquillity enlightenment
factor." Likewise: "Bhikkhus, there is the sign of serenity, the sign of
non-diversion. Wise attention, much practiced, therein is the nutriment
for the arising of the unarisen concentration enlightenment factor, or
it leads to the growth, fulfilment, development and perfection of the
arisen concentration enlightenment factor." Likewise: "Bhikkhus, there
are states productive of the equanimity enlightenment factor. Wise
attention, much practiced, therein is the nutriment for the arising of
the unarisen equanimity enlightenment factor, or it leads to the growth,
fulfilment, development and perfection of the arisen equanimity
enlightenment factor" (S V 104).



[59.]Herein  *wise attention* given to the three instances is
attention occurring in arousing tranquillity, etc., by observing the way
in which they arose in him earlier. The *sign of serenity* is a term for
serenity itself, and *non-diversion* is a term for that too in the sense
of non-distraction.



[60.]There are, besides, seven things that lead to the arising
of the tranquillity enlightenment factor: (i) using superior food, (ii)
living in a good climate, (iii) maintaining a pleasant posture, (iv)
keeping to the middle, (v) avoidance of violent persons, (vi)
cultivation of persons tranquil in body, (vii) resoluteness upon that
\[tranquillity\].



[61.]Eleven things lead to the arising of the concentration
enlightenment factor: (i) making the basis clean, (ii) skill in the
sign, (iii) balancing the faculties, (iv) restraining the mind on
occasion, (v) exerting the mind on occasion, (vi) encouraging the
listless mind by means of faith and a sense of urgency, (vii) looking on
with equanimity at what is occurring rightly, (viii) avoidance of
unconcentrated persons, (ix) cultivation of concentrated persons, (x)
reviewing of the jhānas and liberations, (xi) resoluteness upon that
\[concentration\].



[62.]Five things lead to the arising of the equanimity
enlightenment factor: (i) maintenance of neutrality towards living
beings; (ii) maintenance of neutrality towards formations (inanimate
things); (iii) avoidance of persons who show favouritism towards beings
and formations; (iv) cultivation of persons who maintain neutrality
towards beings and formations; (v) resoluteness upon that
\[equanimity\]. \[135\]



So by arousing these things in these ways he develops the tranquillity
enlightenment factor, as well as the others. This is how he restrains
the mind on an occasion when it should be restrained.



[]



[]



[63.] *6.* How does he *encourage the mind on an occasion when
it should be encouraged*? When his mind is listless owing to
sluggishness in the exercise of understanding or to failure to attain
the bliss of peace, then he should stimulate it by reviewing the eight
grounds for a sense of urgency. These are the four, namely, birth,
aging, sickness, and death, with the suffering of the states of loss as
the fifth, and also the suffering in the past rooted in the round \[of
rebirths\], the suffering in the future rooted in the round \[of
rebirths\], and the suffering in the present rooted in the search for
nutriment. And he creates confidence by recollecting the special
qualities of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. This is how he
encourages the mind on an occasion when it should be encouraged.



[64.] *7.* How does he *look on at the mind with equanimity on
an occasion when it* *should be looked on at with equanimity*? When he
is practicing in this way and his mind follows the road of serenity,
occurs evenly on the object, and is unidle, unagitated and not listless,
then he is not interested to exert or restrain or encourage it; he is
like a charioteer when the horses are progressing evenly. This is how he
looks on at the mind with equanimity on an occasion when it should be
looked on at with equanimity.



[65.]*8. Avoidance of unconcentrated persons* is keeping far
away from persons who have never trodden the way of renunciation, who
are busy with many affairs, and whose hearts are distracted.



*9. Cultivation of concentrated persons* is approaching periodically
persons who



have trodden the way of renunciation and obtained concentration.



*10.* *Resoluteness upon that* is the state of being resolute upon
concentration; the meaning is, giving concentration importance, tending,
leaning and inclining to concentration.



This is how the tenfold skill in concentration should be undertaken.



[66.] Any man who acquires this sign, This tenfold skill will
need to heed\
In order for absorption to gain\
Thus achieving his bolder goal.\
But if in spite of his efforts\
No result comes that might requite\
His work, still a wise wight persists,\
Never this task relinquishing, \[136\]\
Since a tiro, if he gives up,\
Thinking not to continue in\
The task, never gains distinction\
Here no matter how small at all.



A man wise in temperament17\
Notices how his mind inclines:\
Energy and serenity\
Always he couples each to each.



17\. *Buddha---*"possessed of wit": not in PED; see M-a I 39.

Now, his mind, seeing that it holds back,\
He prods, now the restraining rein\
Tightening, seeing it pull too hard;\
Guiding with even pace the race.\
Well-controlled bees get the pollen;\
Well-balanced efforts meet to treat\
Leaves, thread, and ships, and oil-tubes too,\
Gain thus, not otherwise, the prize.\
Let him set aside this lax\
Also this agitated state,\
Steering here his mind at the sign\
As the bee and the rest suggest.



\[THE  FIVE  SIMILES\]



[67.]Here is the explanation of the meaning.



When a too clever bee learns that a flower on a tree is blooming, it
sets out hurriedly, overshoots the mark, turns back, and arrives when
the pollen is finished; and another, not clever enough bee, who sets out
with too slow a speed, arrives when the pollen is finished too; but a
clever bee sets out with balanced speed, arrives with ease at the
cluster of flowers, takes as much pollen as it pleases and enjoys the
honey-dew.



[68.]Again, when a surgeon's pupils are being trained in the
use of the scalpel on a lotus leaf in a dish of water, one who is too
clever applies the scalpel hurriedly and either cuts the lotus leaf in
two or pushes it under the water, and another who is not clever enough
does not even dare to touch it with the scalpel for fear of cutting it
in two or pushing it under; but one who is clever shows the scalpel
stroke on it by means of a balanced effort, and being good at his craft
he is rewarded on such occasions.



[69.] Again when the king announces, "Anyone who can draw out a
spider's thread four fathoms long shall receive four thousand," one man
who is too clever breaks the spider's thread here and there by pulling
it hurriedly, and another who is not clever enough does not dare to
touch it with his hand for fear of breaking it, but a clever man pulls
it out starting from the end with a balanced effort, winds it on a
stick, and so wins the prize.



[70.]Again, a too clever \[137\] skipper hoists full sails in a
high wind and sends his ship adrift, and another, not clever enough
skipper, lowers his sails in a light wind and remains where he is, but a
clever skipper hoists full sails in a light wind, takes in half his
sails in a high wind, and so arrives safely at his desired destination.



[71.]Again, when a teacher says, "Anyone who fills the oil-tube
without spilling any oil will win a prize," one who is too clever fills
it hurriedly out of greed for the prize, and he spills the oil, and
another who is not clever enough does not dare to pour the oil at all
for fear of spilling it, but one who is clever fills it with a balanced
effort and wins the prize.



[72.]Just as in these five similes, so too when the sign
arises, one bhikkhu forces his energy, thinking "I shall soon reach
absorption." Then his mind lapses into



[]



[]



agitation because of his mind's over-exerted energy and he is prevented
from reaching absorption. Another who sees the defect in over-exertion
slacks off his energy, thinking, "What is absorption to me now?" Then
his mind lapses into idleness because of his mind's too lax energy and
he too is prevented from reaching absorption. Yet another who frees his
mind from idleness even when it is only slightly idle and from agitation
when only slightly agitated, confronting the sign with balanced effort,
reaches absorption. One should be like the last-named.



[73.]It was with reference to this meaning that it was said
above:



"Well-controlled bees get the pollen;\
Well-balanced efforts meet to treat\
Leaves, thread, and ships, and oil-tubes too,\
Gain thus, not otherwise, the prize.\
Let him set aside then this lax\
Also this agitated state,\
Steering here his mind at the sign\
As the bee and the rest suggest".



\[ABSORPTION IN THE COGNITIVE SERIES\]



[74.] So, while he is guiding his mind in this way, confronting
the sign, \[then knowing\]: "Now absorption will succeed," there arises
in him mind-door adverting with that same earth kasiṇa as its object,
interrupting the \[occurrence of consciousness as\] life-continuum, and
evoked by the constant repeating of "earth, earth." After that, either
four or five impulsions impel on that same object, the last one of which
is an impulsion of the fine-material sphere. The rest are of the sense
sphere, but they have stronger applied thought, sustained thought,
happiness, bliss, and unification of mind than the normal ones. They are
called "preliminary work" \[consciousnesses\] because they are the
preliminary work for absorption; \[138\] and they are also called
"access" \[consciousnesses\] because of their nearness to absorption
because they happen in its neighbourhood, just as the words "village
access" and "city access" are used for a place near to a village, etc.;
and they are also called "conformity" \[consciousnesses\] because they
conform to those that precede the "preliminary work" \[consciousnesses\]
and to the absorption that follows. And the last of these is also called
"change- of-lineage" because it transcends the limited \[sense-sphere\]
lineage and brings into being the exalted \[fine-material-sphere\]
lineage.18



18\. "It guards the line (*gaṃ tāyati*), thus it is lineage (*gotta*).
When it occurs limitedly, it guards the naming (*abhidhāna*) and the
recognition (*buddhi*) of the naming as restricted to a definite scope
(*ekaṃsa-visayatā*). For just as recognition does not take place without
a meaning (*attha*) for its objective support (*ārammaṇa*), so naming
(*abhidhāna*) does not take place without what is named (*abhidheyya*).
So it (the *gotta*) is said to protect and keep these. But the limited
should be regarded as the materiality peculiar to sense- sphere states,
which are the resort of craving for sense desires, and destitute of the
exalted (fine-material and immaterial) or the unsurpassed
(supramundane). The exalted lineage is explainable in the same way"
(Vism-mhṭ 134).



[]



[]



[75.] But omitting repetitions,19 then either the first is the
"preliminary work," the second "access," the third "conformity," and the
fourth, "change-of-lineage," or else the first is "access," the second
"conformity," and the third "change-of- lineage." Then either the fourth
\[in the latter case\] or the fifth \[in the former case\] is the
absorption consciousness. For it is only either the fourth or the fifth
that fixes in absorption. And that is according as there is swift or
sluggish direct- knowledge. (cf. XXI.117) Beyond that, impulsion lapses
and the life-continuum20 takes over.



[76.]But the Abhidhamma scholar, the Elder Godatta, quoted this
text: "Preceding profitable states are a condition, as repetition
condition, for succeeding profitable states" (Paṭṭh I 5). Adding, "It is
owing to the repetition condition that each succeeding state is strong,
so there is absorption also in the sixth and seventh."



[77.]That is rejected by the commentaries with the remark that
it is merely that elder's opinion, adding that, "It is only either in
the fourth or the fifth21 that there is absorption. Beyond that,
impulsion lapses. It is said to do so because of nearness of the
life-continuum." And that has been stated in this way after
consideration, so it cannot be rejected. For just as a man who is
running towards a precipice and wants to stop cannot do so when he has
his foot on the edge but falls over it, so there can be no fixing in
absorption in the sixth or the seventh because of the nearness to the
life-continuum. That is why it should be understood that there is
absorption only in the fourth or the fifth.



19\. See XVII.189 and note.\



20\. "The intention is that it is as if the sixth and seventh impulsions
had lapsed since impulsion beyond the fifth is exhausted. The elder's
opinion was that just as the first impulsion, which lacks the quality of
repetition, does not arouse change-of-lineage because of its weakness,
while the second or the third, which have the quality of repetition, can
do so because they are strong on that account, so too the sixth and
seventh fix in absorption owing to their strength due to their quality
of repetition. But it is unsupported by a sutta or by any teacher's
statement in conformity with a sutta. And the text quoted is not a
reason because strength due to the quality of repetition is not a
principle without exceptions *(anekantikattā);* for the first volition,
which is not a repetition, has result experienceable here and now, while
the second to the sixth, which are repetitions, have result
experienceable in future becomings" (Vism-mhṭ 135).\



21\. "'*Either in the fourth or the fifth,'* etc., is said for the
purpose of concluding \[the discussion\] with a paragraph showing the
correctness of the meaning already stated.--- Herein, if the sixth and
seventh impulsions are said to have lapsed because impulsion is
exhausted, how does seventh-impulsion volition come to have result
experienceable in the next rebirth and to be of immediate effect on
rebirth?---This is not owing to strength got through a repetition
condition.---What then?---It is owing to the difference in the
function's position *(kiriyāvatthā). * For the function \[of impulsion\]
has three positions, that is, initial, medial and final. Herein,
experienceability of result in the next rebirth and immediateness of
effect on rebirth are due to the last volition's final position, not to
its strength ... So the fact that the sixth and seventh lapse because
impulsion is used up cannot be objected to" (Vism-mhṭ 135). See Table V.



[]



[]



[78.] But that absorption is only of a single conscious moment.
For there are seven instances in which the normal extent22 \[of the
cognitive series\] does not apply. They are in the cases of the first
absorption, the mundane kinds of direct- knowledge, the four paths,
fruition next after the path, life-continuum jhāna in the fine-material
and immaterial kinds of becoming, the base consisting of neither
perception nor non-perception as condition for cessation \[of perception
and feeling\], and the fruition attainment in one emerging from
cessation. Here the fruition next after the path does not exceed three
\[consciousnesses in number\]; \[139\] the \[consciousnesses\] of the
base consisting of neither perception nor non- perception as condition
for cessation do not exceed two \[in number\]; there is no measure of
the \[number of consciousnesses in the\] life-continuum in the fine-
material and immaterial \[kinds of becoming\]. In the remaining
instances \[the number of consciousnesses is\] one only. So absorption
is of a single consciousness moment. After that, it lapses into the
life-continuum. Then the life-continuum is interrupted by adverting for
the purpose of reviewing the jhāna, next to which comes the reviewing of
the jhāna.



\[THE FIRST JHĀNA\]



[79.] At this point, "Quite secluded from sense desires,
secluded from unprofitable things he enters upon and dwells in the first
jhāna, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought with
happiness and bliss born of seclusion" (Vibh 245), and so he has
attained the first jhāna, which abandons five factors, possesses five
factors, is good in three ways, possesses ten characteristics, and is of
the earth kasiṇa.



[80.] Herein,  *quite secluded from sense desires* means having
secluded himself from, having become without, having gone away from,
sense desires. Now, this word  *quite * (*eva*) should be understood to
have the meaning of absoluteness. Precisely because it has the meaning
of absoluteness it shows how, on the actual occasion of entering upon
and dwelling in the first jhāna, sense desires as well as being
non-existent then are the first jhāna's contrary opposite, and it also
shows that the arrival takes place only (*eva*) through the letting go
of sense desires. How?



[81.]When absoluteness is introduced thus, "quite secluded from
sense desires," what is expressed is this: sense desires are certainly
incompatible with this jhāna; when they exist, it does not occur, just
as when there is darkness, there is no lamplight; and it is only by
letting go of them that it is reached, just as the further bank is
reached only by letting go of the near bank. That is why absoluteness is
introduced.



[82.]Here it might be asked: But why is this \[word "quite"\]
mentioned only in the first phrase and not in the second? How is this,
might he enter upon and



22\. "'*The normal extent does not apply'* here  *'in the seven
instances'* because of the immeasurability of the conscious moment in
some, and the extreme brevity of the moment in others; for *'extent'* is
inapplicable here in the sense of complete cognitive series, which is
why 'in fruition next to the path,' etc., is said" (Vism mhṭ 136).



[]



[]



dwell in the first jhāna even when not secluded from unprofitable
things?---It should not be regarded in that way. It is mentioned in the
first phrase as the escape from them; for this jhāna is the escape from
sense desires since it surmounts the sense-desire element and since it
is incompatible with greed for sense desires, according as it is said:
"The escape from sense desires is this, that is to say, renunciation" (D
III 275). But in the second phrase \[140\] the word *eva* should be
adduced and taken as said, as in the passage, "Bhikkhus, only (*eva*)
here is there an ascetic, here a second ascetic" (M I 63). For it is
impossible to enter upon and dwell in jhāna unsecluded also from
unprofitable things, in other words, the hindrances other than that
\[sense desire\]. So this word must be read in both phrases thus: "Quite
secluded from sense desires, quite secluded from unprofitable things."
And although the word "secluded" as a general term includes all kinds of
seclusion, that is to say, seclusion by substitution of opposites, etc.,
and bodily seclusion, etc.,23 still only the three, namely, bodily
seclusion, mental seclusion, and seclusion by suppression (suspension)
should be regarded here.



[83.] But this term "sense desires" should be regarded as
including all kinds, that is to say, sense desires as object as given in
the Niddesa in the passage beginning, "What are sense desires as object?
They are agreeable visible objects ..." (Nidd I 1), and the sense
desires as defilement given there too and in the Vibhaṅga thus: "Zeal as
sense desire (*kāma*), greed as sense desire, zeal and greed as sense
desire, thinking as sense desire, greed as sense desire, thinking and
greed as sense desire"24 (Nidd I 2; Vibh 256). That being so, the words
"quite secluded from sense desires" properly mean "quite secluded from
sense desires as object," and express bodily seclusion, while the words
"secluded from unprofitable things" properly mean "secluded from sense
desires as defilement or from all unprofitable things," and express
mental seclusion. And in this case giving up of pleasure in sense
desires is indicated by the first since it only expresses seclusion from
sense desires as object, while acquisition of pleasure



23\. The five (see e.g. Paṭis II 220; M-a I 85) are suppression (by
concentration), substitution of opposites (by insight), cutting off (by
the path), tranquillization (by fruition), and escape (as Nibbāna); cf.
five kinds of deliverance (e.g. M-a IV 168). The *three* (see e.g. Nidd
I 26; M-a II 143) are bodily seclusion (retreat), mental seclusion
(jhāna), and seclusion from the substance or circumstances of becoming
(Nibbāna).



24\. Here *saṅkappa* ("thinking") has the meaning of "hankering."
*Chanda, kāma* and *rāga * and their combinations need sorting out.
*Chanda * (zeal, desire) is much used, neutral in colour, good or bad
according to context and glossed by "desire to act"; technically also
one of the four roads to power and four predominances. *Kāma* (sense
desire, sensuality) loosely represents enjoyment of the five sense
pleasures (e.g. sense-desire sphere). More narrowly it refers to sexual
enjoyment (third of the Five Precepts). Distinguished as subjective
desire (defilement) and objective things that arouse it (Nidd I 1; cf.
Ch. XIV, n.36). The figure "five cords of sense desire" signifies simply
these desires with the five sense objects that attract them. *Rāga*
(greed) is the general term for desire in its bad sense and identical
with *lobha,* which latter, however, appears technically as one of the
three root-causes of unprofitable action. *Rāga * is renderable also by
"lust" in its general sense. *Kāmacchanda* (lust): a technical term for

in renunciation is indicated by the second since it expresses seclusion
from sense desire as defilement.



[84.]And with sense desires as object and sense desires as
defilement expressed in this way, it should also be recognized that the
abandoning of the objective basis for defilement is indicated by the
first of these two phrases and the abandoning of the \[subjective\]
defilement by the second; also that the giving up of the cause of
cupidity is indicated by the first and \[the giving up of the cause\] of
stupidity by the second; also that the purification of one's occupation
is indicated by the first and the educating of one's inclination by the
second.



This, firstly, is the method here when the words *from sense desires*
are treated as



referring to sense desires as object.



[85.]But if they are treated as referring to sense desires as
defilement, then it is simply just zeal for sense desires
(*kāmacchanda*) in the various forms of zeal (*chanda*), greed (*rāga*),
etc., that is intended as "sense desires" (*kāma*) (§83, 2nd quotation).
\[141\] And although that \[lust\] is also included by \[the word\]
"unprofitable," it is nevertheless stated separately in the Vibhaṅga in
the way beginning, "Herein, what are sense desires? Zeal as sense desire
..." (Vibh 256) because of its incompatibility with jhāna. Or,
alternatively, it is mentioned in the first phrase because it is sense
desire as defilement and in the second phrase because it is included in
the "unprofitable." And because this \[lust\] has various forms,
therefore "from sense desires" is said instead of "from sense desire."



[86.] And although there may be unprofitableness in other
states as well, nevertheless only the hindrances are mentioned
subsequently in the Vibhaṅga thus, "Herein, what states are
unprofitable? Lust ..." (Vibh 256), etc., in order to show their
opposition to, and incompatibility with, the jhāna factors. For the
hindrances are the contrary opposites of the jhāna factors: what is
meant is that the jhāna factors are incompatible with them, eliminate
them, abolish them. And it is said accordingly in the *Peṭaka*
(*Peṭakopadesa*): "Concentration is incompatible with lust, happiness
with ill will, applied thought with stiffness and torpor, bliss with
agitation and worry, and sustained thought with uncertainty" (not in
*Peṭakopadesa*).



[87.] So in this case it should be understood that seclusion by
suppression (suspension) of lust is indicated by the phrase quite
secluded from sense desires, and seclusion by suppression (suspension)
of \[all\] five hindrances by the phrase secluded from unprofitable
things. But omitting repetitions, that of lust is indicated by the first
and that of the remaining hindrances by the second. Similarly with the
three unprofitable roots, that of greed, which has the five cords of
sense desire (M I 85) as its province, is indicated by the first, and
that of hate and delusion, which have as their respective provinces the
various grounds for annoyance (A IV 408; V 150), etc., by the second. Or
with the states consisting of the floods, etc., that of the flood of
sense desires, of the bond of sense desires, of the canker of sense
desires, of sense-desire clinging, of the bodily tie of



the first of the five hindrances. *Chanda-rāga* (zeal and greed) and
*kāma-rāga* (greed for sense desires) have no technical use.



[]



[]



covetousness, and of the fetter of greed for sense desires, is indicated
by the first, and that of the remaining floods, bonds, cankers,
clingings, ties, and fetters, is indicated by the second. Again, that of
craving and of what is associated with craving is indicated by the
first, and that of ignorance and of what is associated with ignorance is
indicated by the second. Furthermore, that of the eight thought-
arisings associated with greed (XIV.90) is indicated by the first, and
that of the remaining kinds of unprofitable thought-arisings is
indicated by the second.



This, in the first place, is the explanation of the meaning of the words
"quite



secluded from sense desires, secluded from unprofitable things."



[88.]So far the factors abandoned by the jhāna have been shown.
And now, in order to show the factors associated with it, *which is
accompanied by applied and sustained thought* is said. \[142\] Herein,
applied thinking (*vitakkana*) is *applied thought * (*vitakka*);
hitting upon, is what is meant.25 It has the characteristic of directing
the mind on to an object (mounting the mind on its object). Its function
is to strike at and thresh---for the meditator is said, in virtue of it,
to have the object struck at by applied thought, threshed by applied
thought. It is manifested as the leading of the mind onto an object.
Sustained thinking (*vicaraṇa*) is *sustained thought * (*vicāra*);
continued sustainment (*anusañcaraṇa*), is what is meant. It has the
characteristic of continued pressure on (occupation with) the object.
Its function is to keep conascent \[mental\] states \[occupied\] with
that. It is manifested as keeping consciousness anchored \[on that
object\].



[89.]And, though sometimes not separate, *applied thought* is
the first impact of the mind in the sense that it is both gross and
inceptive, like the striking of a bell. *Sustained thought* is the act
of keeping the mind anchored, in the sense that it is subtle with the
individual essence of continued pressure, like the ringing of the bell. 
*Applied thought* intervenes, being the interference of consciousness at
the time of first arousing \[thought\], like a bird's spreading out its
wings when about to soar into the air, and like a bee's diving towards a
lotus when it is minded to follow up the scent of it. The behaviour of
*sustained thought* is quiet, being the near non-interference of
consciousness, like the bird's planing with outspread wings after
soaring into the air, and like the bee's buzzing above the lotus after
it has dived towards it.



[90.] In the commentary to the Book of Twos26 this is said:
"Applied thought occurs as a state of directing the mind onto an object,
like the movement of a large bird taking off into the air by engaging
the air with both wings and forcing them downwards. For it causes
absorption by being unified. Sustained thought occurs with the
individual essence of continued pressure, like the bird's movement when
it is using (activating) its wings for the purpose of keeping



25\. *Úhana---*"hitting upon": possibly connected with *ūhanati * (to
disturb---see M I 243; II 193). Obviously connected here with the
meaning of *āhananapariyāhanana* ("striking and threshing") in the next
line. For the similes that follow here, see Peṭ 142.



26\. Of the Aṅguttara Nikāya? \[The original could not be traced
anywhere in the Tipiṭaka, Aṭṭhakathā, and other texts contained in the
digitalised Chaṭṭha Saṅgāyana edition of the Vipassana Research
Institute. Dhs-a 114 quotes the same passage, but gives the source as
*aṭṭhakathāyaṃ*, "in the commentary." BPS ed.\]

hold on the air. For it keeps pressing the object27". That fits in with
the latter's occurrence as anchoring. This difference of theirs becomes
evident in the first and second jhānas \[in the fivefold reckoning\].



[91.]Furthermore, *applied thought* is like the hand that grips
firmly and *sustained thought* is like the hand that rubs, when one
grips a tarnished metal dish firmly with one hand and rubs it with
powder and oil and a woollen pad with the other hand. Likewise, when a
potter has spun his wheel with a stroke on the stick and is making a
dish \[143\], his supporting hand is like *applied thought* and his hand
that moves back and forth is like *sustained thought*. Likewise, when
one is drawing a circle, the pin that stays fixed down in the centre is
like *applied thought*, which directs onto the object, and the pin that
revolves round it is like *sustained thought*, which continuously
presses.



[92.]So this jhāna occurs together with this applied thought
and this sustained thought and it is called, "accompanied by applied and
sustained thought" as a tree is called "accompanied by flowers and
fruits." But in the Vibhaṅga the teaching is given in terms of a
person28 in the way beginning, "He is possessed, fully possessed, of
this applied thought and this sustained thought" (Vibh 257). The meaning
should be regarded in the same way there too.



[93.]*Born of seclusion*: here secludedness (*vivitti*) is
seclusion (*viveka*); the meaning is, disappearance of hindrances. Or
alternatively, it is secluded (*vivitta*), thus it is seclusion; the
meaning is, the collection of states associated with the jhāna is
secluded from hindrances. "Born of seclusion" is born of or in that kind
of seclusion.



[94.]*Happiness and bliss*: it refreshes (*pīnayati*), thus it
is happiness (*pīti*). It has the characteristic of endearing
(*sampiyāyanā*). Its function is to refresh the body and the mind; or
its function is to pervade (thrill with rapture). It is manifested as
elation. But it is of five kinds as minor happiness, momentary
happiness, showering happiness, uplifting happiness, and pervading
(rapturous) happiness.



Herein, *minor happiness* is only able to raise the hairs on the body.
*Momentary* *happiness * is like flashes of lightning at different
moments. *Showering happiness* breaks over the body again and again like
waves on the sea shore.



[95.] *Uplifting happiness* can be powerful enough to levitate
the body and make it spring up into the air. For this was what happened
to the Elder Mahā-Tissa, resident at Puṇṇavallika. He went to the shrine
terrace on the evening of the full-moon day. Seeing the moonlight, he
faced in the direction of the Great Shrine \[at Anurādhapura\],
thinking, "At this very hour the four

28\. *Puggalādhiṭṭhāna---*"in terms of a person"; a technical
commentarial term for one of the ways of presenting a subject. They are
*dhammā-desanā * (discourse about principles), and *puggala-desanā*
(discourse about persons), both of which may be treated either as
*dhammādhiṭṭhāna * (in terms of principles) or *puggalādhiṭṭhāna * (in
terms of persons). See M-a I 24.

assemblies29 are worshipping at the Great Shrine!" By means of objects
formerly seen \[there\] he aroused uplifting happiness with the
Enlightened One as object, and he rose into the air like a painted ball
bounced off a plastered floor and alighted on the terrace of the Great
Shrine.



[96.] And this was what happened to the daughter of a clan in
the village of Vattakālaka near the Girikaṇḍaka Monastery when she
sprang up into the air owing to strong uplifting happiness with the
Enlightened One as object. As her parents were about to go to the
monastery in the evening, it seems, in order to hear the Dhamma \[144\],
they told her: "My dear, you are expecting a child; you cannot go out at
an unsuitable time. We shall hear the Dhamma and gain merit for you." So
they went out. And though she wanted to go too, she could not well
object to what they said. She stepped out of the house onto a balcony
and stood looking at the Ākāsacetiya Shrine at Girikaṇḍaka lit by the
moon. She saw the offering of lamps at the shrine, and the four
communities as they circumambulated it to the right after making their
offerings of flowers and perfumes; and she heard the sound of the massed
recital by the Community of Bhikkhus. Then she thought: "How lucky they
are to be able to go to the monastery and wander round such a shrine
terrace and listen to such sweet preaching of Dhamma!" Seeing the shrine
as a mound of pearls and arousing uplifting happiness, she sprang up
into the air, and before her parents arrived she came down from the air
into the shrine terrace, where she paid homage and stood listening to
the Dhamma.



[97.]When her parents arrived, they asked her, "What road did
you come by?" She said, "I came through the air, not by the road," and
when they told her, "My dear, those whose cankers are destroyed come
through the air. But how did you come?" she replied: "As I was standing
looking at the shrine in the moonlight a strong sense of happiness arose
in me with the Enlightened One as its object. Then I knew no more
whether I was standing or sitting, but only that I was springing up into
the air with the sign that I had grasped, and I came to rest on this
shrine terrace."



So uplifting happiness can be powerful enough to levitate the body, make
it



spring up into the air.



[98.] But when *pervading*  (*rapturous*)  *happiness* arises,
the whole body is completely pervaded, like a filled bladder, like a
rock cavern invaded by a huge inundation.



[99.]Now, this fivefold happiness, when conceived and matured,
perfects the twofold tranquillity, that is, bodily and mental
tranquillity. When tranquillity is conceived and matured, it perfects
the twofold bliss, that is, bodily and mental bliss. When bliss is
conceived and matured, it perfects the threefold concentration, that is,
momentary concentration, access concentration, and absorption
concentration.



Of these, what is intended in this context by happiness is pervading
happiness, which is the root of absorption and comes by growth into
association with absorption. \[145\]



29\. The four assemblies (*parisā*) are the bhikkhus, bhikkhunīs, laymen
followers and laywomen followers.

[100.] But as to the other word: pleasing (*sukhana*) is bliss
(*sukha*). Or alternatively: it thoroughly (*SUṭṭhu*) devours
(*KHĀdati*), consumes (*KHAṇati*),30 bodily and mental affliction, thus
it is bliss (*sukha*). It has gratifying as its characteristic. Its
function is to intensify associated states. It is manifested as aid.



And wherever the two are associated, happiness is the contentedness at
getting a desirable object, and bliss is the actual experiencing of it
when got. Where there is happiness there is bliss (pleasure); but where
there is bliss there is not necessarily happiness. Happiness is included
in the formations aggregate; bliss is included in the feeling aggregate.
If a man, exhausted31 in a desert, saw or heard about a pond on the edge
of a wood, he would have happiness; if he went into the wood's shade and
used the water, he would have bliss. And it should be understood that
this is said because they are obvious on such occasions.



[101.] Accordingly, (a) this happiness and this bliss are of
this jhāna, or in this jhāna; so in this way this jhāna is qualified by
the words *with happiness and bliss* \[and also *born of seclusion*\].
Or alternatively: (b) the words *happiness and bliss* (*pītisukhaṃ*) can
be taken as "the happiness and the bliss" independently, like "the
Dhamma and the Discipline" (*dhammavinaya*), and so then it can be taken
as seclusion-born happiness-and-bliss of this jhāna, or in this jhāna;
so in this way it is the happiness and bliss \[rather than the jhāna\]
that are born of seclusion. For just as the words "born of seclusion"
can \[as at (a)\] be taken as qualifying the word "jhāna," so too they
can be taken here \[as at (b)\] as qualifying the expression "happiness
and bliss," and then that \[total expression\] is predicated of this
\[jhāna\]. So it is also correct to call "happiness-and-bliss
born-of-seclusion" a single expression. In the Vibhaṅga it is stated in
the way beginning, "This bliss accompanied by this happiness" (Vibh
257). The meaning should be regarded in the same way there too.



[102.] *First jhāna*: this will be explained below (§119).



*Enters upon* (*upasampajja*): arrives at; reaches, is what is meant; or
else, taking it as "makes enter" (*upasampādayitvā*), then producing, is
what is meant. In the Vibhaṅga this is said: "'Enters upon': the
gaining, the regaining, the reaching, the arrival at, the touching, the
realizing of, the entering upon (*upasampadā*, the first jhāna" (Vibh
257), the meaning of which should be regarded in the same way.



[103.] *And dwells in* (*viharati*): by becoming possessed of
jhāna of the kind described above through dwelling in a posture
favourable to that \[jhāna\], he produces a posture, a procedure, a
keeping, an enduring, a lasting, a behaviour, a dwelling, of the person.
For this is said in the Vibhaṅga: "'Dwells in': poses,



30\. For this word play see also XVII.48. *Khaṇati* is only given in
normal meaning of "to dig" in PED. There seems to be some confusion of
meaning with *khayati * (to destroy) here, perhaps suggested by
*khādati* (to eat). This suggests a rendering here and in Ch. XVII of
"to consume" which makes sense. Glossed by *avadāriyati,* to break or
dig: not in PED. See CPD *"avadārana."\
*31. *Kantāra-khinna---*"exhausted in a desert"; *khinna* is not in PED.



[]



[]



proceeds, keeps, endures, lasts, behaves, dwells; \[146\] hence 'dwells'
is said" (Vibh 252).



[104.]Now, it was also said above *which abandons five factors,
possesses five factors* (§79; cf. M I 294). Herein, the abandoning of
the five factors should be understood as the abandoning of these five
hindrances, namely, lust, ill will, stiffness and torpor, agitation and
worry, and uncertainty; for no jhāna arises until these have been
abandoned, and so they are called the factors of abandoning. For
although other unprofitable things too are abandoned at the moment of
jhāna, still only these are specifically obstructive to jhāna.



[105.] The mind affected through lust by greed for varied
objective fields does not become concentrated on an object consisting in
unity, or being overwhelmed by lust, it does not enter on the way to
abandoning the sense-desire element. When pestered by ill will towards
an object, it does not occur uninterruptedly. When overcome by stiffness
and torpor, it is unwieldy. When seized by agitation and worry, it is
unquiet and buzzes about. When stricken by uncertainty, it fails to
mount the way to accomplish the attainment of jhāna. So it is these only
that are called factors of abandoning because they are specifically
obstructive to jhāna.



[106.] But applied thought directs the mind onto the object;
sustained thought keeps it anchored there. Happiness produced by the
success of the effort refreshes the mind whose effort has succeeded
through not being distracted by those hindrances; and bliss intensifies
it for the same reason. Then unification aided by this directing onto,
this anchoring, this refreshing and this intensifying, evenly and
rightly centres (III.3) the mind with its remaining associated states on
the object consisting in unity. Consequently, possession of five factors
should be understood as the arising of these five, namely, applied
thought, sustained thought, happiness, bliss and unification of mind.



[107.] For it is when these are arisen that jhāna is said to be
arisen, which is why they are called the five factors of possession.
Therefore it should not be assumed that the jhāna is something other
which possesses them. But just as "The army with the four factors" (Vin
IV 104) and "Music with the five factors" (M-a II 300) and "The path
with the eight factors (eightfold path)" are stated simply in terms of
their factors, so this too \[147\] should be understood as stated simply
in terms of its factors, when it is said to "have five factors" or
"possess five factors."



[108.] And while these five factors are present also at the
moment of access and are stronger in access than in normal
consciousness, they are still stronger here than in access and acquire
the characteristic of the fine-material sphere. For applied thought
arises here directing the mind on to the object in an extremely lucid
manner, and sustained thought does so pressing the object very hard, and
the happiness and bliss pervade the entire body. Hence it is said: "And
there is nothing of his whole body not permeated by the happiness and
bliss born of seclusion" (D I 73). And unification too arises in the
complete contact with the object that the surface of a box's lid has
with the surface of its base. This is how they differ from the others.



[]



[]



[109.] Although unification of mind is not actually listed
among these factors in the \[summary\] version \[beginning\] "which is
accompanied by applied and sustained thought" (Vibh 245), nevertheless
it is mentioned \[later\] in the Vibhaṅga as follows: "'Jhāna': it is
applied thought, sustained thought, happiness, bliss, unification"(Vibh
257), and so it is a factor too; for the intention with which the
Blessed One gave the summary is the same as that with which he gave the
exposition that follows it.



[110.] *Is good in three ways, possesses ten characteristics*
(§79): the goodness in three ways is in the beginning, middle, and end.
The possession of the ten characteristics should be understood as the
characteristics of the beginning, middle, and end, too. Here is the
text:



[111.] "Of the first jhāna, purification of the way is the
beginning, intensification



of equanimity is the middle, and satisfaction is the end. "'Of the first
jhāna, purification of the way is the beginning': how many
characteristics has the beginning? The beginning has three
characteristics: the mind is purified of obstructions to that \[jhāna\];
because it is purified the mind makes way for the central \[state of
equilibrium, which is the\] sign of serenity; because it has made way
the mind enters into that state. And it is since the mind becomes
purified of obstructions and, through being purified, makes way for the
central \[state of equilibrium, which is the\] sign of serenity and,
having made way, enters into that state, that the purification of the
way is the beginning of the first jhāna. These are the three
characteristics of the beginning. Hence it is said: 'The first jhāna is
good in the beginning which possesses three characteristics.' \[148\]



[112.] "'Of the first jhāna intensification of equanimity is
the middle': how many characteristics has the middle? The middle has
three characteristics. He \[now\] looks on with equanimity at the mind
that is purified; he looks on with equanimity at it as having made way
for serenity; he looks on with equanimity at the appearance of unity.32
And in that he \[now\] looks on with equanimity at the mind that is
purified and looks on with equanimity at it as having made way for
serenity and looks on with equanimity at the appearance of unity, that
intensification of equanimity is the middle of the first jhāna. These
are the three characteristics of the middle. Hence it is said: 'The
first jhāna is good in the middle which possesses three
characteristics.'



[113.] "'Of the first jhāna satisfaction is the end': how many
characteristics has the end? The end has four characteristics. The
satisfaction in the sense that there was non-excess of any of the states
arisen therein, and the satisfaction in the sense that the faculties had
a single function, and the satisfaction in the sense



32\. Four unities *(ekatta)* are given in the preceding paragraph of the
same Paṭisambhidā ref.: "The unity consisting in the appearance of
relinquishment in the act of giving, which is found in those resolved
upon generosity (giving up); the unity consisting in the appearance of
the sign of serenity, which is found in those who devote themselves to
the higher consciousness; the unity consisting in the appearance of the
characteristic of fall, which is found in those with insight; the unity
consisting in the appearance of cessation, which is found in noble
persons" (Paṭis I 167). The second is meant here.



[]



[]



that the appropriate energy was effective, and the satisfaction in the
sense of repetition, are the satisfaction in the end of the first jhāna.
These are the four characteristics of the end. Hence it is said: 'The
first jhāna is good in the end which possesses four characteristics'"
(Paṭis I 167--68).



[114.] Herein,  *purification of the way* is access together
with its concomitants. *Intensification of equanimity* is absorption.
*Satisfaction * is reviewing. So some comment.33 But it is said in the
text, "The mind arrived at unity enters into purification of the way, is
intensified in equanimity, and is satisfied by knowledge" (Paṭis I 167),
and therefore it is from the standpoint within actual absorption that 
*purification of the way* firstly should be understood as the approach,
with *intensification of equanimity* as the function of equanimity
consisting in specific neutrality, and *satisfaction* as the
manifestation of clarifying knowledge's function in accomplishing
non-excess of states. How?



[115.] Firstly, in a cycle \[of consciousness\] in which
absorption arises the mind becomes purified from the group of
defilements called hindrances that are an obstruction to jhāna. Being
devoid of obstruction because it has been purified, it makes way for the
central \[state of equilibrium, which is the\] sign of serenity. Now, it
is the absorption concentration itself occurring evenly that is called
*the sign of serenity*. But the consciousness immediately before that
\[149\] reaches that state by way of change in a single continuity (cf.
XXII.1--6), and so it is said that it *makes way for the central*
\[*state of equilibrium, which is the*\]  *sign of serenity*. And it is
said that it *enters into that state* by approaching it through having
made way for it. That is why in the first place *purification of the
way*, while referring to aspects existing in the preceding
consciousness, should nevertheless be understood as the approach at the
moment of the first jhāna's actual arising.



[116.] Secondly, when he has more interest in purifying, since
there is no need to re-purify what has already been purified thus, it is
said that *he looks on with equanimity at the mind that is purified*.
And when he has no more interest in concentrating again what has already
made way for serenity by arriving at the state of serenity, it is said
that *he looks on with equanimity at it as having made way for
serenity*. And when he has no more interest in again causing appearance
of unity in what has already appeared as unity through abandonment of
its association with defilement in making way for serenity, it is said
that *he looks on with equanimity at the appearance of unity*. That is
why *intensification of equanimity* should be understood as the function
of equanimity that consists in specific neutrality.



[117.] And lastly, when equanimity was thus intensified, the
states called concentration and understanding produced there, occurred
coupled together without either one exceeding the other. And also the
\[five\] faculties beginning with faith occurred with the single
function (taste) of deliverance owing to deliverance from the various
defilements. And also the energy appropriate to that, which was
favourable to their state of non-excess and single function, was



33\. "The inmates of the Abhayagiri Monastery in Anurādhapura" (Vism-mhṭ
144).



[]



[]



effective. And also its repetition occurs at that moment.34 Now, all
these \[four\] aspects are only produced because it is after seeing with
knowledge the various dangers in defilement and advantages in cleansing
that satisfiedness, purifiedness and clarifiedness ensue accordingly.
That is the reason why it was said that *satisfaction * should be
understood as the manifestation of clarifying knowledge's function in
accomplishing non-excess, etc., of states (§114).



[118.] Herein, satisfaction as a function of knowledge is
called "the end" since the knowledge is evident as due to onlooking
equanimity, according as it is said: "He looks on with complete
equanimity at the mind thus exerted; then the understanding faculty is
outstanding as understanding due to equanimity. Owing to equanimity the
mind is liberated from the many sorts of defilements; then the
understanding faculty is outstanding as understanding due to liberation.
Because of being liberated these states come to have a single function;
then \[the understanding faculty is outstanding as understanding due
to\] development in the sense of the single function"35 (Paṭis II 25).



[119.] Now, as to the words *and so he has attained the first
jhāna* ... *of the earth kasiṇa* (§79): Here it is *first * because it
starts a numerical series; \[150\] also it is first because it arises
first. It is called *jhāna * because of lighting (*upanijjhāna*) the
object and because of burning up (*jhāpana*) opposition (Paṭis I 49).
The disk of earth is called *earth kasiṇa* (*paṭhavīkasiṇa---*lit.
"earth universal") in the sense of entirety,36 and the sign acquired
with that as its support and also the jhāna acquired in the earth-kasiṇa
sign are so called too. So that jhāna should be understood as *of the
earth kasiṇa* in this sense, with reference to which it was said above
"and so he has attained to the first jhāna ... of the earth kasiṇa."



[120.] When it has been attained in this way, the mode of its
attainment must be discerned by the meditator as if he were a
hair-splitter or a cook. For when a very skilful archer, who is working
to split a hair, actually splits the hair on one occasion, he discerns
the modes of the position of his feet, the bow, the bowstring, and the
arrow thus: "I split the hair as I stood thus, with the bow thus, the
bowstring thus, the arrow thus." From then on he recaptures those same
modes and repeats the splitting of the hair without fail. So too the
meditator must discern such modes as that of suitable food, etc., thus:
"I attained this after eating this food, attending on such a person, in
such a lodging, in this posture at this time." In this way, when that
\[absorption\] is lost, he will be able to recapture those modes and
renew the absorption, or while familiarizing himself with it he will be
able to repeat that absorption again and again.



[121.] And just as when a skilled cook is serving his employer,
he notices



whatever he chooses to eat and from then on brings only that sort and so
obtains



34\. "'*Its*': of that jhāna consciousness. '*At that moment*'*:* at the
moment of dissolution; for when the moment of arising is past,
repetition occurs starting with the moment of presence" (Vism-mhṭ 145).
A curious argument; see §182.\



35\. The quotation is incomplete and the end should read, "...
*ekarasaṭṭhena* *bhāvanāvasena paññāvasena paññindriyaṃ adhimattaṃ
hoti*."



36\. "In the sense of the jhāna's entire object. It is not made its
partial object" (Vism-mhṭ 147).



[]



[]



a reward, so too this meditator discerns such modes as that of the food,
etc., at the time of the attaining, and he recaptures them and
re-obtains absorption each time it is lost. So he must discern the modes
as a hair-splitter or a cook does.



[122.]And this has been said by the Blessed One: "Bhikkhus,
suppose a wise, clever, skilful cook set various kinds of sauces before
a king or a king's minister, such as sour, bitter, sharp, \[151\] sweet,
peppery and unpeppery, salty and unsalty sauces; then the wise, clever,
skilful cook learned his master's sign thus 'today this sauce pleased my
master' or 'he held out his hand for this one' or 'he took a lot of this
one' or 'he praised this one' or 'today the sour kind pleased my master'
or 'he held out his hand for the sour kind' or 'he took a lot of the
sour kind' or 'he praised the sour kind' ... or 'he praised the unsalty
kind'; then the wise, clever, skilful cook is rewarded with clothing and
wages and presents. Why is that? Because that wise, clever, skilful cook
learned his master's sign in this way. So too, bhikkhus, here a wise,
clever, skilful bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body as a body ... He
dwells contemplating feelings as feelings ... consciousness as
consciousness ... mental objects as mental objects, ardent, fully aware
and mindful, having put away covetousness and grief for the world. As he
dwells contemplating mental objects as mental objects, his mind becomes
concentrated, his defilements are abandoned. He learns the sign of that.
Then that wise, clever, skilful bhikkhu is rewarded with a happy abiding
here and now, he is rewarded with mindfulness and full awareness. Why is
that? Because that wise, clever, skilful bhikkhu learned his
consciousness's sign" (S V 151--52).



[123.] And when he recaptures those modes by apprehending the
sign, he just succeeds in reaching absorption, but not in making it
last. It lasts when it is absolutely purified from states that obstruct
concentration.



[124.] When a bhikkhu enters upon a jhāna without \[first\]
completely suppressing lust by reviewing the dangers in sense desires,
etc., and without \[first\] completely tranquillizing bodily
irritability37 by tranquillizing the body, and without \[first\]
completely removing stiffness and torpor by bringing to mind the
elements of initiative, etc., (§55), and without \[first\] completely
abolishing agitation and worry by bringing to mind the sign of serenity,
etc., \[152\] and without \[first\] completely purifying his mind of
other states that obstruct concentration, then that bhikkhu soon comes
out of that jhāna again, like a bee that has gone into an unpurified
hive, like a king who has gone into an unclean park.



[125.] But when he enters upon a jhāna after \[first\]
completely purifying his mind of states that obstruct concentration,
then he remains in the attainment even for a whole day, like a bee that
has gone into a completely purified hive, like a king who has gone into
a perfectly clean park. Hence the Ancients said:



37\. *Kāya-duṭṭhulla---"*bodily irritability": explained here as "bodily
disturbance *(daratha), * excitement of the body *(kāya-sāraddhatā)" *
by Vism-mhṭ (p.148); here it represents the hindrance of ill will; cf. M
III 151, 159, where commented on as *kāyālasiya---* "bodily inertia"
(M-a IV 202, 208). PED, only gives meaning of "wicked, lewd" for
*duṭṭhulla*, for which meaning see e.g. A I 88, Vin-a 528; cf. IX.69.



[]



[]



"So let him dispel any sensual lust, and resentment,\
Agitation as well, and then torpor, and doubt as the fifth; There let
him find joy with a heart that is glad in seclusion, Like a king in a
garden where all and each corner is clean."



[126.] So if he wants to remain long in the jhāna, he must
enter upon it after



\[first\] purifying his mind from obstructive states.



\[EXTENSION OF THE SIGN\]



In order to perfect the development of consciousness he should besides
extend the counterpart sign according as acquired. Now, there are two
planes for extension, namely, access and absorption; for it is possible
to extend it on reaching access and on reaching absorption. But the
extending should be done consistently in one \[or the other\], which is
why it was said "he should besides extend the counterpart sign according
as acquired."



[127.] The way to extend it is this. The meditator should not
extend the sign as a clay bowl or a cake or boiled rice or a creeper or
a piece of cloth is extended. He should first delimit with his mind
successive sizes for the sign, according as acquired, that is to say,
one finger, two fingers, three fingers, four fingers, and then extend it
by the amount delimited, just as a ploughman delimits with the plough
the area to be ploughed and then ploughs within the area delimited, or
just as bhikkhus fixing a boundary first observe the marks and then fix
it. He should not, in fact, extend it without having delimited \[the
amount it is to be extended by\]. After that has been done, he can
further extend it, doing so by delimiting successive boundaries of, say,
a span, a *ratana* (=2 spans), the veranda,\
the surrounding space,38 the monastery, and the boundaries of the
village, the town, the district, the kingdom and the ocean, \[153\]
making the extreme limit the world-sphere or even beyond.



[128.] Just as young swans first starting to use their wings
soar a little distance at a time, and by gradually increasing it
eventually reach the presence of the moon and sun, so too when a bhikkhu
extends the sign by successive delimitations in the way described, he
can extend it up to the limit of the world- sphere or even beyond.



[129.] Then that sign \[appears\] to him like an ox hide
stretched out with a hundred pegs39 over the earth's ridges and hollows,
river ravines, tracts of scrub and thorns, and rocky inequalities (see M
III 105) in any area to which it has been extended.



38\. For  *pamukha---*"veranda" see n. 2 above.
*Pariveṇa---*"surrounding space": this meaning, not given in PED, is
brought out clearly in XI.7.



39\. *Samabbhāhata---*"stretch flat": not in this sense in PED. This
word replaces the word *suvihata* used at M III 105 where this clause is
borrowed from. At XI.92, the same word (apparently in another sense) is
glossed by *pellana* = "pushing" (not in PED) at\
Vism-mhṭ 362. M-a IV 153 glosses *suvihata* with "*pasāretvā suṭṭhu
vihata*" which suggests "stretched" rather than "beaten"; *harati*
rather than *hanati*.



[]



[]



When a beginner has reached the first jhāna in this sign, he should
enter upon it often without reviewing it much. For the first jhāna
factors occur crudely and weakly in one who reviews it much. Then
because of that they do not become conditions for higher endeavour.
While he is endeavouring for the unfamiliar \[higher jhāna\] he falls
away from the first jhāna and fails to reach the second.



[130.] Hence the Blessed One said: "Bhikkhus, suppose there
were a foolish stupid mountain cow, with no knowledge of fields and no
skill in walking on craggy mountains, who thought: 'What if I walked in
a direction I never walked in before, ate grass I never ate before,
drank water I never drank before?' and without placing her forefoot
properly she lifted up her hind foot; then she would not walk in the
direction she never walked in before or eat the grass she never ate
before or drink the water she never drank before, and also she would not
get back safely to the place where she had thought, 'What if I walked in
a direction I never walked in before ... drank water I never drank
before?' Why is that? Because that mountain cow was foolish and stupid
with no knowledge of fields and no skill in walking on craggy mountains.
So too, bhikkhus, here is a certain foolish stupid bhikkhu with no
knowledge of fields and no skill, quite secluded from sense desires,
secluded from unprofitable things, in entering upon and dwelling in the
first jhāna, which is accompanied by applied thought and sustained
thought with happiness and bliss born of seclusion; he does not repeat,
develop or cultivate that sign or properly establish it. He thinks:
'What if with the subsiding of applied and sustained thought I entered
upon and dwelt in the second jhāna, which is ... with happiness and
bliss born of concentration?' \[154\] He is unable with the subsiding of
applied and sustained thought to enter upon and dwell in the second
jhāna, which is ... with happiness and bliss born of concentration. Then
he thinks: 'What if, quite secluded from sense desires, secluded from
unprofitable things, I entered upon and dwelt in the first jhāna, which
is ... with happiness and bliss born of seclusion?' He is unable, quite
secluded from sense desires, secluded from unprofitable things, to enter
upon and dwell in the first jhāna which is ... with happiness and bliss
born of seclusion. This bhikkhu is called one who has slipped between
the two, who has fallen between the two, just like the foolish stupid
mountain cow with no knowledge of fields and no skill in walking on
craggy mountains ..." (A IV 418--19).



[131.] Therefore he should acquire mastery in the five ways
first of all with respect to the first jhāna. Herein, these are the five
kinds of mastery: mastery in adverting, mastery in attaining, mastery in
resolving (steadying the duration), mastery in emerging, and mastery in
reviewing. "He adverts to the first jhāna where, when, and for as long
as, he wishes; he has no difficulty in adverting; thus it is mastery in
adverting. He attains the first jhāna where ... he has no difficulty in
attaining; thus it is mastery in attaining" (Paṭis I 100), and all the
rest should be quoted in detail (XXIII.27).



[132.] The explanation of the meaning here is this. When he
emerges from the



first jhāna and first of all adverts to the applied thought, then, next
to the



[]



[]



adverting that arose interrupting the life-continuum, either four or
five impulsions impel with that applied thought as their object. Then
there are two life-continuum \[consciousnesses\]. Then there is
adverting with the sustained thought as its object and followed by
impulsions in the way just stated. When he is able to prolong his
conscious process uninterruptedly in this way with the five jhāna
factors, then his mastery of adverting is successful. But this mastery
is found at its acme of perfection in the Blessed One's Twin Marvel
(Paṭis I 125), or for others on the aforesaid occasions. There is no
quicker mastery in adverting than that.



[133.] The venerable Mahā-Moggallāna's ability to enter upon
jhāna quickly, as in the taming of the royal nāga-serpent Nandopananda
(XII.106f.), is called mastery in attaining.



[134.] Ability to remain in jhāna for a moment consisting in
exactly a finger- snap or exactly ten finger-snaps is called mastery in
resolving (steadying the duration).



Ability to emerge quickly in the same way is called mastery in emerging.



[135.] The story of the Elder Buddharakkhita may be told in
order to illustrate both these last. \[155\] Eight years after his
admission to the Community that elder was sitting in the midst of thirty
thousand bhikkhus possessed of supernormal powers who had gathered to
attend upon the sickness of the Elder Mahā- Rohanagutta at
Therambatthala. He saw a royal supaṇṇa (bird) swooping down from the sky
intending to seize an attendant royal nāga-serpent as he was getting
rice-gruel accepted for the elder. The Elder Buddharakkhita created a
rock meanwhile, and seizing the royal nāga by the arm, he pushed him
inside it. The royal supaṇṇa gave the rock a blow and made off. The
senior elder remarked: "Friends, if Rakkhita had not been there, we
should all have been put to shame."40



[136.] Mastery in reviewing is described in the same way as
mastery in adverting; for the reviewing impulsions are in fact those
next to the adverting mentioned there (§132).



[137.] When he has once acquired mastery in these five ways,
then on emerging from the now familiar first jhāna he can regard the
flaws in it in this way: "This attainment is threatened by the nearness
of the hindrances, and its factors are weakened by the grossness of the
applied and sustained thought." He can bring the second jhāna to mind as
quieter and so end his attachment to the first jhāna and set about doing
what is needed for attaining the second.



[138.] When he has emerged from the first jhāna, applied and
sustained thought appear gross to him as he reviews the jhāna factors
with mindfulness and full awareness, while happiness and bliss and
unification of mind appear peaceful. Then, as he brings that same sign
to mind as "earth, earth" again and again



40\. What the story is trying to illustrate is the rapidity with which
the elder entered the jhāna, controlled its duration, and emerged, which
is the necessary preliminary to the working of a marvel (the creation of
a rock in this case; XII.57). The last remark seems to indicate that all
the others would have been too slow (see Vism-mhṭ 150).



[]



[]



with the purpose of abandoning the gross factors and obtaining the
peaceful factors, \[knowing\] "now the second jhāna will arise," there
arises in him mind-door adverting with that same earth kasiṇa as its
object, interrupting the life-continuum. After that, either four or five
impulsions impel on that same object, the last one of which is an
impulsion of the fine-material sphere belonging to the second jhāna. The
rest are of the sense sphere of the kinds already stated (§74).



\[THE SECOND JHĀNA\]



[139.] And at this point, "With the stilling of applied and
sustained thought he enters upon and dwells in the second jhāna, which
has internal confidence and singleness of mind without applied thought,
without sustained thought, with happiness and bliss born of
concentration" (Vibh 245), and so he has attained the second jhāna,
which abandons two factors, possesses three factors, is good in three
ways, possesses ten characteristics and is of the earth kasiṇa. \[156\]



[140.] Herein,  *with the stilling of applied and sustained
thought*: with the stilling, with the surmounting, of these two, namely,
applied thought and sustained thought; with their non-manifestation at
the moment of the second jhāna, is what is meant. Herein, although none
of the states belonging to the first jhāna exist in the second
jhāna---for the contact, etc. (see M III 25), in the first jhāna are one
and here they are another---it should be understood all the same that
the phrase "with the stilling of applied and sustained thought" is
expressed in this way in order to indicate that the attaining of the
other jhānas, beginning with that of the second from the first, is
effected by the surmounting of the gross factor in each case.



[141.] *Internal*: here one's own internal41 is intended; but
that much is actually stated in the Vibhaṅga too with the words
"internally in oneself" (Vibh 258). And since one's own internal is
intended, the meaning here is this: born in oneself, generated in one's
own continuity.



[142.] *Confidence*: it is faith that is called confidence. The
jhāna "has confidence" because it is associated with confidence as a
cloth "has blue colour" because it is associated with blue colour. Or
alternatively, that jhāna is stated to "have confidence" because it
makes the mind confident with the confidence possessed by it and by
stilling the disturbance created by applied and sustained thought. And
with this conception of the meaning the word construction must be taken
as "confidence of mind." But with the first-mentioned conception of the
meaning the words "of mind" must be construed with "singleness42".



[143.] Here is the construction of the meaning in that case.
Unique (*eka*) it comes up (*udeti*), thus it is single (*ekodi*); the
meaning is, it comes up as the superlative, the best, because it is not
overtopped by applied and sustained thought, for the best is called
"unique" in the world. Or it is permissible to say that when deprived



41\. See XIV.192 and note.\



42\. In the Pali, *sampasādanaṃ cetaso ekodibhāvaṃ: cetaso* ("of mind")
comes between *sampasādanaṃ* ("confidence") and *ekodibhāvaṃ*
("singleness") and so can be construed with either.



[]



[]



of applied and sustained thought it is unique, without companion. Or
alternatively: it evokes (*udāyati*) associated states, thus it is an
evoker (*udi*); the meaning is, it arouses. And that is unique (*eka*)
in the sense of best, and it is an evoker (*udi*), thus it is a unique
evoker (*ekodi * = single). This is a term for\
concentration. Then, since the second jhāna gives existingness to
(*bhāveti*), augments, this single \[thing\], it "gives singleness"
(*ekodibhāva*). But as this single \[thing\] is a mind's, not a being's
or a soul's, so singleness of mind is said.



[144.] It might be asked: But does not this faith exist in the
first jhāna too, and also this concentration with the name of the
"single \[thing\]?" Then why is only this second jhāna said to have
confidence and singleness of mind?---It may be replied as follows: It is
because that first jhāna \[157\] is not fully confident owing to the
disturbance created by applied and sustained thought, like water ruffled
by ripples and wavelets. That is why, although faith does exist in it,
it is not called "confidence." And there too concentration is not fully
evident because of the lack of full confidence. That is why it is not
called "singleness" there. But in this second jhāna faith is strong,
having got a footing in the absence of the impediments of applied and
sustained thought; and concentration is also evident through having
strong faith as its companion. That may be understood as the reason why
only this jhāna is described in this way.



[145.] But that much is actually stated in the Vibhaṅga too
with the words: "'Confidence' is faith, having faith, trust, full
confidence. 'Singleness of mind' is steadiness of consciousness ...
right concentration" (Vibh 258). And this commentary on the meaning
should not be so understood as to conflict with the meaning stated in
that way, but on the contrary so as to agree and concur with it.



[146.] *Without applied thought, without sustained thought*:
since it has been abandoned by development, there is no applied thought
in this, or of this, \[jhāna\], thus it is without applied thought. The
same explanation applies to sustained thought. Also it is said in the
Vibhaṅga: "So this applied thought and this sustained thought are
quieted, quietened, stilled, set at rest, set quite at rest, done away
with, quite done away with,43 dried up, quite dried up, made an end of;
hence it is said: without applied thought, without sustained thought"
(Vibh 258).



Here it may be asked: Has not this meaning already been established by
the words "with the stilling of applied and sustained thought?" So why
is it said again "without applied thought, without sustained
thoughts?"---It may be replied: Yes, that meaning has already been
established. But this does not indicate that meaning. Did we not say
earlier: "The phrase 'with the stilling of applied and sustained
thought' is expressed in this way in order to indicate that the act of
attaining the other jhānas, beginning with that of the second from the
first, is effected by the surmounting of the gross factor in each case?"
(§140).



[147.] Besides, this confidence comes about with the act of
stilling, not the



darkness of defilement, but the applied and sustained thought. And the



43\. *Appita---*"done away with": *Appitā ti vināsaṃ gamitā* ("*Appita*"
means "made to go to annihilation") (Vism-mhṭ 153). This meaning, though
not in PED, is given in CPD.



[]



[]



singleness comes about, not as in access jhāna with the abandoning of
the hindrances, nor as in the first jhāna with the manifestation of the
factors, but with the act of stilling the applied and sustained thought.
So that \[first\] clause indicates the cause of the confidence and
singleness. In the same way this jhāna is without applied thought and
without sustained thought, not as in the third and fourth jhānas or as
in eye-consciousness, etc., with just absence, but with the actual act
of stilling the applied and sustained thought. So that \[first clause\]
also indicates the cause of the state without applied and sustained
thought; it does not indicate the bare absence of applied and sustained
thought. \[158\] The bare absence of applied and sustained thought is
indicated by this \[second\] clause, namely, "without applied thought,
without sustained thought." Consequently it needs to be stated
notwithstanding that the first has already been stated.



[148.] *Born of concentration*: born of the first-jhāna
concentration, or born of associated concentration, is the meaning.
Herein, although the first was born of associated concentration too,
still it is only this concentration that is quite worthy to be called
"concentration" because of its complete confidence and extreme
immobility due to absence of disturbance by applied and sustained
thought. So only this \[jhāna\] is called "born of concentration," and
that is in order to recommend it.



*With happiness and bliss* is as already explained. *Second*: second in
numerical



series. Also second because entered upon second.



[149.] Then it was also said above *which abandons two factors,
possesses three* *factors * (§139). Herein, the abandoning of two
factors should be understood as the abandoning of applied thought and
sustained thought. But while the hindrances are abandoned at the moment
of the access of the first jhāna, in the case of this jhāna the applied
thought and sustained thought are not abandoned at the moment of its
access. It is only at the moment of actual absorption that the jhāna
arises without them. Hence they are called its factors of abandoning.



[150.] Its possession of three factors should be understood as
the arising of the three, that is, happiness, bliss, and unification of
mind. So when it is said in the Vibhaṅga, "'Jhāna': confidence,
happiness, bliss, unification of mind" (Vibh 258), this is said
figuratively in order to show that jhāna with its equipment. But,
excepting the confidence, this jhāna has literally three factors *qua *
factors that have attained to the characteristic of lighting (see §119),
according as it is said: "What is jhāna of three factors on that
occasion? It is happiness, bliss, unification of mind" (Vibh 263).



The rest is as in the case of the first jhāna.



[151.]Once this has been obtained in this way, and he has
mastery in the five ways already described, then on emerging from the
now familiar second jhāna he can regard the flaws in it thus: "This
attainment is threatened by the nearness of applied and sustained
thought; 'Whatever there is in it of happiness, of mental excitement,
proclaims its grossness' (D I 37), and its factors are weakened by the
grossness of the happiness so expressed." He can bring the third jhāna
to mind



[]



[]



as quieter and so end his attachment to the second jhāna and set about
doing what is needed for attaining the third.



[152.] When he has emerged from the second jhāna \[159\]
happiness appears gross to him as he reviews the jhāna factors with
mindfulness and full awareness, while bliss and unification appear
peaceful. Then as he brings that same sign to mind as "earth, earth"
again and again with the purpose of abandoning the gross factor and
obtaining the peaceful factors, \[knowing\] "now the third jhāna will
arise," there arises in him mind-door adverting with that same earth
kasiṇa as its object, interrupting the life-continuum. After that,
either four or five impulsions impel on that same object, the last one
of which is an impulsion of the fine-material sphere belonging to the
third jhāna. The rest are of the kinds already stated (§74).



\[THE THIRD JHĀNA\]



[153.] And at this point, "With the fading away of happiness as
well he dwells in equanimity, and mindful and fully aware, he feels
bliss with his body; he enters upon and dwells in the third jhāna, on
account of which the Noble Ones announce: 'He dwells in bliss who has
equanimity and is mindful' (Vibh 245), and so he has attained the third
jhāna, which abandons one factor, possesses two factors, is good in
three ways, possesses ten characteristics, and is of the earth kasiṇa.



[154.]Herein,  *with the fading away of happiness as well*
(*pītiyā ca virāgā*): fading away is distaste for, or surmounting of,
happiness of the kind already described. But the words "as well" (*ca*)
between the two \[words *pītiyā* and *virāgā*\] have the meaning of a
conjunction;44 they conjoin \[to them\] either the word "stilling" or
the expression "the stilling of applied and sustained thought" \[in the
description of the second jhāna\]. Herein, when taken as conjoining
"stilling" the construction to be understood is "with the fading away
and, what is more, with the stilling, of happiness." With this
construction "fading away" has the meaning of distaste; so the meaning
can be regarded as "with distaste for, and with the stilling of,
happiness." But when taken as conjoining the words "stilling of applied
and sustained thought," then the construction to be understood is "with
the fading of happiness and, further, with the stilling of applied and
sustained thought." With this construction "fading away" has the meaning
of surmounting; so this meaning can be regarded as "with the surmounting
of happiness and with the stilling of applied and sustained thought."



[155.] Of course, applied and sustained thought have already
been stilled in the second jhāna, too. However, this is said in order to
show the path to this third jhāna and in order to recommend it. For when
"with the stilling of applied and sustained thought" is said, it is
declared that the path to this jhāna is necessarily by the stilling of
applied and sustained thought. And just as, although mistaken view of
individuality, etc., are not abandoned in the attaining of the third
noble path \[but in the first\], yet when it is recommended by
describing their



44\. *Sampiṇḍana---*"conjunction": gram. term for the word *ca* (and).
This meaning not given in PED. Cf. M-a I 40.



[]



[]



abandonment thus, "With the abandoning of the five lower fetters" (A I
232), \[160\] then it awakens eagerness in those trying to attain that
third noble path--- so too, when the stilling of applied and sustained
thought is mentioned, though they are not actually stilled here \[but in
the second\], this is a recommendation. Hence the meaning expressed is
this: "With the surmounting of happiness and with the stilling of
applied and sustained thought."



[156.] *He dwells in equanimity*: it watches \[things\] as they
arise (*UPApattito* *IKKHATI*), thus it is equanimity (*upekkhā---*or
onlooking); it sees fairly, sees without partiality (*a-pakkha-patita*),
is the meaning. A possessor of the third jhāna is said to "dwell in
equanimity" since he possesses equanimity that is clear, abundant and
sound.



Equanimity is of ten kinds; six-factored equanimity, equanimity as a
divine abiding, equanimity as an enlightenment factor, equanimity of
energy, equanimity about formations, equanimity as a feeling, equanimity
about insight, equanimity as specific neutrality, equanimity of jhāna
and equanimity of purification.



[157.] Herein, *six factored equanimity* is a name for the
equanimity in one whose cankers are destroyed. It is the mode of
non-abandonment of the natural state of purity when desirable or
undesirable objects of the six kinds come into focus in the six doors
described thus: "Here a bhikkhu whose cankers are destroyed is neither
glad nor sad on seeing a visible object with the eye: he dwells in
equanimity, mindful and fully aware" (A III 279).



[158.] *Equanimity as a divine abiding* is a name for
equanimity consisting in the mode of neutrality towards beings described
thus: "He dwells intent upon one quarter with his heart endued with
equanimity" (D I 251).



[159.] *Equanimity as an enlightenment factor* is a name for
equanimity consisting in the mode of neutrality in conascent states
described thus: "He develops the equanimity enlightenment factor
depending on relinquishment" (M I 11).



[160.] *Equanimity of energy* is a name for the equanimity
otherwise known as neither over-strenuous nor over-lax energy described
thus: "From time to time he brings to mind the sign of equanimity" (A I
257).



[161.] *Equanimity about formations* is a name for equanimity
consisting in neutrality about apprehending reflexion and composure
regarding the hindrances, etc., described thus: "How many kinds of
equanimity about formations arise through concentration? How many kinds
of equanimity about formations arise through insight? Eight kinds of
equanimity about formations arise through concentration. Ten kinds of
equanimity about formations arise through insight"45 (Paṭis I 64).
\[161\]



45\. The "eight kinds" are those connected with the eight jhānas, the
"ten kinds" those connected with the four paths, the four fruitions, the
void liberation, and the signless liberation.

[]



[162.] *Equanimity as a feeling* is a name for the equanimity
known as neither- pain-nor-pleasure described thus: "On the occasion on
which a sense-sphere profitable consciousness has arisen accompanied by
equanimity" (Dhs §156).



[163.] *Equanimity about insight* is a name for equanimity
consisting in neutrality about investigation described thus: "What
exists, what has become, that he abandons, and he obtains equanimity" (M
II 264--65, A IV 70f).



[164.] *Equanimity as specific neutrality* is a name for
equanimity consisting in the equal efficiency of conascent states; it is
contained among the "or-whatever states" beginning with zeal (XIV.133;
Dhs-a 132).



[165.] *Equanimity of jhāna* is a name for equanimity producing
impartiality towards even the highest bliss described thus: "He dwells
in equanimity" (Vibh 245).



[166.] *Purifying equanimity* is a name for equanimity purified
of all opposition, and so consisting in uninterestedness in stilling
opposition described thus: "The fourth jhāna, which ... has mindfulness
purified by equanimity" (Vibh 245).



[167.] Herein,  six-factored equanimity, equanimity as a divine
abiding, equanimity as an enlightenment factor, equanimity as specific
neutrality, equanimity of jhāna and purifying equanimity are one in
meaning, that is, equanimity as specific neutrality. Their difference,
however, is one of position,46 like the difference in a single being as
a boy, a youth, an adult, a general, a king, and so on. Therefore of
these it should be understood that equanimity as an enlightenment
factor, etc., are not found where there is six-factored equanimity; or
that six-factored equanimity, etc., are not found where there is
equanimity as an enlightenment factor.



And just as these have one meaning, so also equanimity about formations
and equanimity about insight have one meaning too; for they are simply
understanding classed in these two ways according to function.



[168.] Just as, when a man has seen a snake go into his house
in the evening and has hunted for it with a forked stick, and then when
he has seen it lying in the grain store and has looked to discover
whether it is actually a snake or not, and then by seeing three marks47
has no more doubt, and so there is neutrality in him about further
investigating whether or not it is a snake, \[162\] so too, when a man
has begun insight, and he sees with insight knowledge the three
characteristics, then there is neutrality in him about further
investigating the impermanence, etc., of formations, and that neutrality
is called *equanimity about insight*.



[169.] But just as, when the man has caught hold of the snake
securely with the forked stick and thinks, "How shall I get rid of the
snake without hurting it or getting bitten by it?" then as he is seeking
only the way to get rid of it, there is neutrality in him about the
catching hold of it, so too, when a man, through seeking the three
characteristics, sees the three kinds of becoming as if burning,



46\. *Avatthā---"*position, occasion." Not in PED; see CPD.



47\. *Sovatthika-ttaya---*"three marks;" cf. XXI.49.



[]



[]



then there is neutrality in him about catching hold of formations, and
that neutrality is called *equanimity about formations*.



[170.] So when equanimity about insight is established,
equanimity about formations is established too. But it is divided into
two in this way according to function, in other words, according to
neutrality about investigating and about catching hold.



*Equanimity of energy* and  *equanimity as feeling* are different both
from each



other and from the rest.



[171.] So, of these kinds of equanimity, it is equanimity of
jhāna that is intended here. That has the characteristic of neutrality.
Its function is to be unconcerned. It is manifested as uninterestedness.
Its proximate cause is the fading away of happiness.



Here it may be said: Is this not simply equanimity as specific
neutrality in the meaning? And that exists in the first and second
jhānas as well; so this clause, "He dwells in equanimity," ought to be
stated of those also. Why is it not?---\[It may be replied:\] Because
its function is unevident there since it is overshadowed by applied
thought and the rest. But it appears here with a quite evident function,
with head erect, as it were, because it is not overshadowed by applied
thought and sustained thought and happiness. That is why it is stated
here.



The commentary on the meaning of the clause "He dwells in equanimity" is



thus completed in all its aspects.



[172.] Now, as to *mindful and fully aware*: here, he remembers
(*sarati*), thus he is mindful (*sata*). He has full awareness
(*sampajānāti*), thus he is fully aware (*sampajāna*). This is
mindfulness and full awareness stated as personal attributes. Herein,
mindfulness has the characteristic of remembering. Its function is not
to forget. It is manifested as guarding. Full awareness has the
characteristic of non-confusion. Its function is to investigate (judge).
It is manifested as scrutiny.



[173.] Herein, although this mindfulness and this full
awareness exist in the earlier jhānas as well---for one who is forgetful
and not fully aware does not attain even access, let alone
absorption---yet, because of the \[comparative\] grossness of those
jhānas, the mind's going is easy \[there\], like that of a man on
\[level\] ground, and so the functions of mindfulness and full awareness
are not evident in them. \[163\] But it is only stated here because the
subtlety of this jhāna, which is due to the abandoning of the gross
factors, requires that the mind's going always includes the functions of
mindfulness and full awareness, like that of a man on a razor's edge.



[174.]What is more, just as a calf that follows a cow returns
to the cow when taken away from her if not prevented, so too, when this
third jhāna is led away from happiness, it would return to happiness if
not prevented by mindfulness and full awareness, and would rejoin
happiness. And besides, beings are greedy for bliss, and this kind of
bliss is exceedingly sweet since there is none greater. But here there
is non-greed for the bliss owing to the influence of the mindfulness and
full awareness, not for any other reason. And so it should also be
understood that it is stated only here in order to emphasize this
meaning too.



[]



[]



[175.] Now, as to the clause *he feels bliss with his body*:
here, although in one actually possessed of the third jhāna there is no
concern about feeling bliss, nevertheless he would feel the bliss
associated with his mental body, and after emerging from the jhāna he
would also feel bliss since his material body would have been affected
by the exceedingly superior matter originated by that bliss associated
with the mental body.48 It is in order to point to this meaning that the
words "he feels bliss with his body" are said.



[176.] Now, as to the clause, that ... on account of which the
Noble Ones announce: He dwells in bliss who has equanimity and is
mindful: here it is the jhāna, on account of which as cause, on account
of which as reason, the Noble Ones, that is to say, the Enlightened
Ones, etc., "announce, teach, declare, establish, reveal, expound,
explain, clarify" (Vibh 259) that person who possesses the third
jhāna---they praise, is what is intended. Why? Because "he dwells in
bliss who has equanimity and is mindful. He enters upon and dwells in
that third jhāna" (*taṃ * ...  *tatiyaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharati*) is
how the construction should be understood here. But why do they praise
him thus? Because he is worthy of praise.



[177.] For this man is worthy of praise since he has equanimity
towards the third jhāna though it possesses exceedingly sweet bliss and
has reached the perfection of bliss, and he is not drawn towards it by a
liking for the bliss, and he is mindful with the mindfulness established
in order to prevent the arising of happiness, and he feels with his
mental body the undefiled bliss beloved of Noble Ones, cultivated by
Noble Ones. Because he is worthy of praise in this way, it should be
understood, Noble Ones praise him with the words, "He dwells in bliss
who has equanimity and is mindful," thus declaring the special qualities
that are worthy of praise.



\[164\] *Third*: it is the third in the numerical series; and it is
third because it is



entered upon third.



[178.] Then it was said, *which abandons one factor, possesses
two factors* (§153): here the abandoning of the one factor should be
understood as the abandoning of happiness. But that is abandoned only at
the moment of absorption, as applied thought and sustained thought are
at that of the second jhāna; hence it is called its factor of
abandoning.



[179.] The possession of the two factors should be understood
as the arising of the two, namely, bliss and unification. So when it is
said in the Vibhaṅga, "'Jhāna': equanimity, mindfulness, full awareness,
bliss, unification of mind" (Vibh 260), this is said figuratively in
order to show that jhāna with its equipment. But, excepting the
equanimity and mindfulness and full awareness, this jhāna has literally
only two factors *qua * factors that have attained to the characteristic
of lighting (see §119), according as it is said, "What is the jhāna of
two factors on that occasion? It is bliss and unification of mind" (Vibh
264).



The rest is as in the case of the first jhāna.



48\. For consciousness-originated materiality see XX.30 ff.



[]



[]



[180.] Once this has been obtained in this way, and once he has
mastery in the five ways already described, then on emerging from the
now familiar third jhāna, he can regard the flaws in it thus: "This
attainment is threatened by the nearness of happiness; 'Whatever there
is in it of mental concern about bliss proclaims its grossness' (D I 37;
see Ch. IX, n. 20), and its factors are weakened by the grossness of the
bliss so expressed." He can bring the fourth jhāna to mind as quieter
and so end his attachment to the third jhāna and set about doing what is
needed for attaining the fourth.



[181.] When he has emerged from the third jhāna, the bliss, in
other words, the mental joy, appears gross to him as he reviews the
jhāna factors with mindfulness and full awareness, while the equanimity
as feeling and the unification of mind appear peaceful. Then, as he
brings that same sign to mind as "earth, earth" again and again with the
purpose of abandoning the gross factor and obtaining the peaceful
factors, \[knowing\] "now the fourth jhāna will arise," there arises in
him mind-door adverting with that same earth kasiṇa as its object,
interrupting the life-continuum. After that either four or five
impulsions impel on that same object, \[165\] the last one of which is
an impulsion of the fine-material sphere belonging to the fourth jhāna.
The rest are of the kinds already stated (§74).



[182.] But there is this difference: blissful (pleasant)
feeling is not a condition, as repetition condition, for
neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, and \[the preliminary work\] must
be aroused in the case of the fourth jhāna with neither-
painful-nor-pleasant feeling; consequently these \[consciousnesses of
the preliminary work\] are associated with neither-painful-nor-pleasant
feeling, and here happiness vanishes simply owing to their association
with equanimity.



\[THE FOURTH JHĀNA\]



[183.] And at this point, "With the abandoning of pleasure and
pain and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief he enters upon
and dwells in the fourth jhāna, which has neither-pain-nor-pleasure and
has purity of mindfulness due to equanimity" (Vibh 245), and so he has
attained the fourth jhāna, which abandons one factor, possesses two
factors, is good in three ways, possesses ten characteristics, and is of
the earth kasiṇa.



[184.] Herein,  *with the abandoning of pleasure and pain*:
with the abandoning of bodily pleasure and bodily pain. *With the
previous*: which took place before, not in the moment of the fourth
jhāna. *Disappearance of joy and grief*: with the previous disappearance
of the two, that is, mental bliss (pleasure) and mental pain; with the
abandoning, is what is meant.



[185.] But when does the abandoning of these take place? At the
moment of access of the four jhānas. For \[mental\] joy is only
abandoned at the moment of the fourth-jhāna access, while \[bodily\]
pain, \[mental\] grief, and \[bodily\] bliss (pleasure) are abandoned
respectively at the moments of access of the first, second, and third
jhānas. So although the order in which they are abandoned is not
actually mentioned, nevertheless the abandoning of the pleasure, pain,
joy, and grief, is stated here according to the order in which the
faculties are summarized in the Indriya Vibhaṅga (Vibh 122).



[]



[]



[186.] But if these are only abandoned at the moments of access
of the several jhānas, why is their cessation said to. take place in the
jhāna itself in the following passage: "And where does the arisen pain
faculty cease without remainder? Here, bhikkhus, quite secluded from
sense desires, secluded from unprofitable things, a bhikkhu enters upon
and dwells in the first jhāna, which is ... born of seclusion. It is
here that the arisen pain faculty ceases without remainder ... Where
does the arisen grief faculty \[cease without remainder? ... in the
second jhāna\] ... Where does the arisen pleasure faculty \[cease
without remainder? ... in the third jhāna\] ... Where does the arisen
joy faculty cease without remainder? \[166\] Here, bhikkhus, with the
abandoning of pleasure and pain \[and with the previous disappearance of
joy and grief\] a bhikkhu enters upon and dwells in the fourth jhāna,
which ... has mindfulness purified by equanimity. It is here that the
arisen joy faculty ceases without remainder" (S V 213--15).



It is said in that way there referring to reinforced cessation. For in
the first jhāna, etc., it is their reinforced cessation, not just their
cessation, that takes place. At the moment of access it is just their
cessation, not their reinforced cessation, that takes place.



[187.] For accordingly, during the first jhāna access, which
has multiple adverting, there could be rearising of the \[bodily\] pain
faculty49 due to contact with gadflies, flies, etc. or the discomfort of
an uneven seat, though that pain faculty had already ceased, but not so
during absorption. Or else, though it has ceased during access, it has
not absolutely ceased there since it is not quite beaten out by
opposition. But during absorption the whole body is showered with bliss
owing to pervasion by happiness. And the pain faculty has absolutely
ceased in one whose body is showered with bliss, since it is beaten out
then by opposition.



49\. "They say that with the words, 'There could be the arising of the
pain faculty,' it is shown that since grief arises even in obtainers of
jhāna, it is demonstrated thereby that hate can exist without being a
hindrance just as greed can; for grief does not arise without hate. Nor,
they say, is there any conflict with the Paṭṭhāna text to be fancied
here, since what is shown there is only grief that occurs making lost
jhāna its object because the grief that occurs making its object a jhāna
that has not been lost is not relevant there. And they say that it
cannot be maintained that grief does not arise at all in those who have
obtained jhāna since it did arise in Asita who had the eight attainments
(Sn 691), and he was not one who had lost jhāna. So they say. That is
wrong because there is no hate without the nature of a hindrance. If
there were, it would arise in fine- material and immaterial beings, and
it does not. Accordingly when in such passages as, 'In the immaterial
state, due to the hindrance of lust there is the hindrance of stiffness
and torpor ... the hindrance of agitation, the hindrance of ignorance'
(Paṭṭh II 291), ill will and worry are not mentioned as hindrances, that
does not imply that they are not hindrances even by supposing that it
was because lust, etc., were not actually hindrances and were called
hindrances there figuratively because of resemblance to hindrances. And
it is no reason to argue, 'it is because it arose in Asita,' since there
is falling away from jhāna with the arising of grief. The way to regard
that is that when the jhāna is lost for some trivial reason such men
reinstate it without difficulty" (Vism-mhṭ 158--59).



[]



[]



[188.]And during the second-jhāna access too, which has
multiple advertings, there could be rearising of the \[mental\] grief
faculty, although it had already ceased there, because it arises when
there is bodily weariness and mental vexation, which have applied
thought and sustained thought as their condition, but it does not arise
when applied and sustained thought are absent. When it arises, it does
so in the presence of applied and sustained thought, and they are not
abandoned in the second-jhāna access; but this is not so in the second
jhāna itself because its conditions are abandoned there.



[189.] Likewise in the third-jhāna access there could be
rearising of the abandoned \[bodily\] pleasure faculty in one whose body
was pervaded by the superior materiality originated by the
\[consciousness associated with the\] happiness. But not so in the third
jhāna itself. For in the third jhāna the happiness that is a condition
for the \[bodily\] bliss (pleasure) has ceased entirely. Likewise in the
fourth-jhāna access there could be re-arising of the abandoned
\[mental\] joy faculty because of its nearness and because it has not
been properly surmounted owing to the absence of equanimity brought to
absorption strength. But not so in the fourth jhāna itself. And that is
why in each case (§186) the words "without remainder" are included thus:
"It is here that the arisen pain faculty ceases without remainder."



[190.] Here it may be asked: Then if these kinds of feeling are
abandoned in the access in this way, why are they brought in here? It is
done so that they can be readily grasped. For the
neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling described here by the words "which
has neither-pain-nor-pleasure" is subtle, hard to recognize and not
readily grasped. So just as, when a cattle-herd50 wants to catch a
refractory ox that cannot be caught at all by approaching it, he
collects all the cattle into one pen \[167\] and lets them out one by
one, and then \[he says\] "That is it; catch it," and so it gets caught
as well, so too the Blessed One has collected all these \[five kinds of
feeling\] together so that they can be grasped readily; for when they
are shown collected together in this way, then what is not \[bodily\]
pleasure (bliss) or \[bodily\] pain or \[mental\] joy or \[mental\]
grief can still be grasped in this way: "This is
neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling."



[191.] Besides, this may be understood as said in order to show
the condition for the neither-painful-nor-pleasant mind-deliverance. For
the abandoning of \[bodily\] pain, etc., are conditions for that,
according as it is said: "There are four conditions, friend, for the
attainment of the neither-painful-nor-pleasant mind- deliverance. Here,
friend, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous
disappearance of joy and grief a bhikkhu enters upon and dwells in the
fourth jhāna ... equanimity. These are the four conditions for the
attainment of the neither-painful-nor-pleasant mind-deliverance" (M I
296).



[192.] Or alternatively, just as, although mistaken view of
individuality, etc., have already been abandoned in the earlier paths,
they are nevertheless mentioned as abandoned in the description of the
third path for the purpose of recommending it (cf. §155), so too these
kinds of feeling can be understood



50\. *Gopa---*"cowherd (or guardian)": not in PED.



[]



[]



as mentioned here for the purpose of recommending this jhāna. Or
alternatively, they can be understood as mentioned for the purpose of
showing that greed and hate are very far away owing to the removal of
their conditions; for of these, pleasure (bliss) is a condition for joy,
and joy for greed; pain is a condition for grief and grief for hate. So
with the removal of pleasure (bliss), etc., greed and hate are very far
away since they are removed along with their conditions.



[193.] *Which has neither-pain-nor-pleasure*: no pain owing to
absence of pain; no pleasure owing to absence of pleasure (bliss). By
this he indicates the third kind of feeling that is in opposition both
to pain and to pleasure, not the mere absence of pain and pleasure. This
third kind of feeling named neither-pain-nor-pleasure is also called
"equanimity." It has the characteristic of experiencing what is contrary
to both the desirable and the undesirable. Its function is neutral. Its
manifestation is unevident. Its proximate cause should be understood as
the cessation of pleasure (bliss).



[194.] *And has purity of mindfulness due to equanimity*: has
purity of mindfulness brought about by equanimity. For the mindfulness
in this jhāna is quite purified, and its purification is effected by
equanimity, not by anything else. That is why it is said to have purity
of mindfulness due to equanimity. Also it is said in the Vibhaṅga: "This
mindfulness is cleared, purified, clarified, by equanimity; hence it is
said to have purity of mindfulness due to equanimity" (Vibh 261).
\[168\] And the equanimity due to which there comes to be this purity of
mindfulness should be understood as specific neutrality in meaning. And
not only mindfulness is purified by it here, but also all associated
states. However, the teaching is given under the heading of mindfulness.



[195.]Herein, this equanimity exists in the three lower jhānas
too; but just as, although a crescent moon exists by day but is not
purified or clear since it is outshone by the sun's radiance in the
daytime or since it is deprived of the night, which is its ally owing to
gentleness and owing to helpfulness to it, so too, this crescent moon of
equanimity consisting in specific neutrality exists in the first jhāna,
etc., but it is not purified since it is outshone by the glare of the
opposing states consisting in applied thought, etc., and since it is
deprived of the night of equanimity-as-feeling for its ally; and because
it is not purified, the conascent mindfulness and other states are not
purified either, like the unpurified crescent moon's radiance by day.
That is why no one among these \[first three jhānas\] is said to have
purity of mindfulness due to equanimity. But here this crescent moon
consisting in specific neutrality is utterly pure because it is not
outshone by the glare of the opposing states consisting in applied
thought, etc., and because it has the night of equanimity-as-feeling for
its ally. And since it is purified, the conascent mindfulness and other
states are purified and clear also, like the purified crescent moon's
radiance. That, it should be understood, is why only this jhāna is said
to have purity of mindfulness due to equanimity.



[196.]*Fourth*: it is fourth in numerical series; and it is
fourth because it is entered upon fourth.



[]



[]



[197.] Then it was said, *which abandons one factor, possesses
two factors* (§183); here the abandoning of the one factor should be
understood as the abandoning of joy. But that joy is actually abandoned
in the first impulsions of the same cognitive series (cf. §185). Hence
it is called its factor of abandoning.



The possession of the two factors should be understood as the arising of
the



two, namely, equanimity as feeling and unification of mind.



The rest is as stated in the case of the first jhāna.



This, in the first place, is according to the fourfold reckoning of
jhāna.



\[THE FIVEFOLD RECKONING OF JHĀNA\]



[198.] When, however, he is developing fivefold jhāna, then, on
emerging from the now familiar first jhāna, he can regard the flaws in
it in this way: "This attainment is threatened by the nearness of the
hindrances, and its factors are weakened by the grossness of applied
thought." \[169\] He can bring the second jhāna to mind as quieter and
so end his attachment to the first jhāna and set about doing what is
needed for attaining the second.



[199.] Now, he emerges from the first jhāna mindfully and fully
aware; and only applied thought appears gross to him as he reviews the
jhāna factors, while the sustained thought, etc., appear peaceful. Then,
as he brings that same sign to mind as "earth, earth" again and again
with the purpose of abandoning the gross factor and obtaining the
peaceful factors, the second jhāna arises in him in the way already
described.



Its factor of abandoning is applied thought only. The four beginning
with



sustained thought are the factors that it possesses. The rest is as
already stated.



[200.] When this has been obtained in this way, and once he has
mastery in the five ways already described, then on emerging from the
now familiar second jhāna he can regard the flaws in it in this way:
"This attainment is threatened by the nearness of applied thought, and
its factors are weakened by the grossness of sustained thought." He can
bring the third jhāna to mind as quieter and so end his attachment to
the second jhāna and set about doing what is needed for attaining the
third.



[201.] Now, he emerges from the second jhāna mindfully and
fully aware; only sustained thought appears gross to him as he reviews
the jhāna factors, while happiness, etc., appear peaceful. Then, as he
brings that same sign to mind as "earth, earth" again and again with the
purpose of abandoning the gross factor and obtaining the peaceful
factors, the third jhāna arises in him in the way already described.



Its factor of abandoning is sustained thought only. The three beginning
with happiness, as in the second jhāna in the fourfold reckoning, are
the factors that it possesses. The rest is as already stated.



[202.] So that which is the second in the fourfold reckoning
becomes the second



and third in the fivefold reckoning by being divided into two. And those
which



[]



[]



are the third and fourth in the former reckoning become the fourth and
fifth in this reckoning. The first remains the first in each case.

## CHAPTER V 


THE REMAINING KASIṆAS



(*Sesa-kasiṇa-niddesa*)



\[THE WATER KASIṆA\]



[1.]\[170\] Now, the water kasiṇa comes next after the earth
kasiṇa (III.105). Here is the detailed explanation.



One who wants to develop the water kasiṇa should, as in the case of the
earth kasiṇa, seat himself comfortably and apprehend the sign in water
that "is either made up or not made up," etc.; and so all the rest
should be repeated in detail (IV.22). And as in this case, so with all
those that follow \[in this chapter\]. We shall in fact not repeat even
this much and shall only point out what is different.



[2.]Here too, when someone has had practice in previous
\[lives\], the sign arises for him in water that is not made up, such as
a pool, a lake, a lagoon, or the ocean as in the case of the Elder
Cūḷa-Sīva. The venerable one, it seems, thought to abandon gain and
honour and live a secluded life. He boarded a ship at Mahātittha
(Mannar) and sailed to Jambudīpa (India). As he gazed at the ocean
meanwhile, the kasiṇa sign, the counterpart of that ocean, arose in him.



[3.] Someone with no such previous practice should guard
against the four faults of a kasiṇa (IV.24) and not apprehend the water
as one of the colours, blue, yellow, red or white. He should fill a bowl
or a four-footed water pot1 to the brim with water uncontaminated by
soil, taken in the open through a clean cloth \[strainer\], or with any
other clear unturbid water. He should put it in a screened place on the
outskirts of the monastery as already described and seat himself
comfortably. He should neither review its colour nor bring its
characteristic to mind. Apprehending the colour as belonging to its
physical support, he should set his mind on the \[name\] concept as the
most outstanding mental datum, and using any among the \[various\] names
for water (*āpo*) such as "rain" (*ambu*), "liquid" (*udaka*), "dew"
(*vāri*), "fluid" (*salila*),2 he should develop \[the kasiṇa\] by using
\[preferably\] the obvious "water, water."



[4.]As he develops it in this way, the two signs eventually
arise in him in the way already described. Here, however, the learning
sign has the appearance of moving. \[171\] If the water has bubbles of
froth mixed with it, the learning sign has the



1\. *Kuṇḍika---*"a four-footed water pot": not in PED.\



2\. English cannot really furnish five words for water.


[]



[]



same appearance, and it is evident as a fault in the kasiṇa. But the
counterpart sign appears inactive, like a crystal fan set in space, like
the disk of a looking- glass made of crystal. With the appearance of
that sign he reaches access jhāna and the jhāna tetrad and pentad in the
way already described.



\[THE FIRE KASIṆA\]



[5.]Anyone who wants to develop the fire kasiṇa should
apprehend the sign in fire. Herein, when someone with merit, having had
previous practice, is apprehending the sign, it arises in him in any
sort of fire, not made up, as he looks at the fiery combustion in a
lamp's flame or in a furnace or in a place for baking bowls or in a
forest conflagration, as in the Elder Cittagutta's case. The sign arose
in that elder as he was looking at a lamp's flame while he was in the
Uposatha house on the day of preaching the Dhamma.



[6.]Anyone else should make one up. Here are the directions for
making it. He should split up some damp heartwood, dry it, and break it
up into short lengths. He should go to a suitable tree root or to a shed
and there make a pile in the way done for baking bowls, and have it lit.
He should make a hole a span and four fingers wide in a rush mat or a
piece of leather or a cloth, and after hanging it in front of the fire,
he should sit down in the way already described. Instead of giving
attention to the grass and sticks below or the smoke above, he should
apprehend the sign in the dense combustion in the middle.



[7.]He should not review the colour as blue or yellow, etc., or
give attention to its characteristic as heat, etc., but taking the
colour as belonging to its physical support, and setting his mind on the
\[name\] concept as the most outstanding mental datum, and using any
among the names for fire (*tejo*) such as "the Bright One" (*pāvaka*),
"the Leaver of the Black Trail" (*kaṇhavattani*), "the Knower of
Creatures" (*jātaveda*), "the Altar of Sacrifice" (*hutāsana*), etc., he
should develop \[the kasiṇa\] by using \[preferably\] the obvious "fire,
fire."



[8.]As he develops it in this way the two signs eventually
arise in him as already described. Herein, the learning sign appears
like \[the fire to keep\] sinking down as the flame keeps detaching
itself. \[172\] But when someone apprehends it in a kasiṇa that is not
made up, any fault in the kasiṇa is evident \[in the learning sign\],
and any firebrand, or pile of embers or ashes, or smoke appears in it.
The counterpart sign appears motionless like a piece of red cloth set in
space, like a gold fan, like a gold column. With its appearance he
reaches access jhāna and the jhāna tetrad and pentad in the way already
described.



\[THE AIR KASIṆA\]



[9.]Anyone who wants to develop the air kasiṇa should apprehend
the sign in air. And that is done either by sight or by touch. For this
is said in the Commentaries: "One who is learning the air kasiṇa
apprehends the sign in air. He notices the tops of \[growing\] sugarcane
moving to and fro; or he notices the tops of bamboos, or the tops of
trees, or the ends of the hair, moving to and fro; or he notices the
touch of it on the body."



[]



[]



[10.]So when he sees sugarcanes with dense foliage standing
with tops level or bamboos or trees, or else hair four fingers long on a
man's head, being struck by the wind, he should establish mindfulness in
this way: "This wind is striking on this place." Or he can establish
mindfulness where the wind strikes a part of his body after entering by
a window opening or by a crack in a wall, and using any among the names
for wind (*vāta*) beginning with "wind" (*vāta*), "breeze" (*māluta*),
"blowing" (*anila*), he should develop \[the kasiṇa\] by using
\[preferably\] the obvious "air, air."



[11.]Here the learning sign appears to move like the swirl of
hot \[steam\] on rice gruel just withdrawn from an oven. The counterpart
sign is quiet and motionless. The rest should be understood in the way
already described.



\[THE BLUE KASIṆA\]



[12.]Next it is said \[in the Commentaries\]: "One who is
learning the blue kasiṇa apprehends the sign in blue, whether in a
flower or in a cloth or in a colour element."3 Firstly, when someone has
merit, having had previous practice, the sign arises in him when he sees
a bush with blue flowers, or such flowers spread out on a place of
offering, or any blue cloth or gem.



[13.]\[173\] But anyone else should take flowers such as blue
lotuses, *girikaṇṇikā* (morning glory) flowers, etc., and spread them
out to fill a tray or a flat basket completely so that no stamen or
stalk shows or with only their petals. Or he can fill it with blue cloth
bunched up together; or he can fasten the cloth over the rim of the tray
or basket like the covering of a drum. Or he can make a kasiṇa disk,
either portable as described under the earth kasiṇa or on a wall, with
one of the colour elements such as bronze-green, leaf-green,
*añjana*-ointment black, surrounding it with a different colour. After
that, he should bring it to mind as "blue, blue" in the way already
described under the earth kasiṇa.



[14.] And here too any fault in the kasiṇa is evident in the
learning sign; the stamens and stalks and the gaps between the petals,
etc., are apparent. The counterpart sign appears like a crystal fan in
space, free from the kasiṇa disk. The rest should be understood as
already described.



\[THE YELLOW KASIṆA\]



[15.]Likewise with the yellow kasiṇa; for this is said: "One
who is learning the yellow kasiṇa apprehends the sign in yellow, either
in a flower or in a cloth or in a colour element." Therefore here too,
when someone has merit, having had previous practice, the sign arises in
him when he sees a flowering bush or flowers spread out, or yellow cloth
or colour element, as in the case of the Elder Cittagutta. That
venerable one, it seems, saw an offering being made on the flower altar,
with *pattaṅga* flowers4 at Cittalapabbata, and as soon as he saw it the
sign arose in him the size of the flower altar.



3\. *Vaṇṇa-dhātu---*"colour element" should perhaps have been rendered
simply by "paint." The one Pali word "*nīla*" has to serve for the
English blue, green, and sometimes black.\



4\. *Pattaṅga*: not in PED. *Āsana---*"altar": not in this sense in PED.



[]



[]



[16.]Anyone else should make a kasiṇa, in the way described for
the blue kasiṇa, with  *kaṇikāra* flowers, etc., or with yellow cloth or
with a colour element. He should bring it to mind as "yellow, yellow."
The rest is as before.



\[THE RED KASIṆA\]



[17.]Likewise with the red kasiṇa; for this is said: "One who
is learning the red kasiṇa apprehends the sign in red, \[174\] either in
a flower or in a cloth or in a colour element." Therefore here too, when
someone has merit, having had previous practice, the sign arises in him
when he sees a *bandhujīvaka* (hibiscus) bush, etc., in flower, or such
flowers spread out, or a red cloth or gem or colour element.



[18.]But anyone else should make a kasiṇa, in the way already
described for the blue kasiṇa, with *jayasumana* flowers or
*bandhujīvaka* or red *koraṇḍaka* flowers, etc., or with red cloth or
with a colour element. He should bring it to mind as "red, red." The
rest is as before.



\[THE WHITE KASIṆA\]



[19.] Of the white kasiṇa it is said: "One who is learning the
white kasiṇa apprehends the sign in white, either in a flower or in a
cloth or in a colour element." So firstly, when someone has merit,
having had previous practice, the sign arises in him when he sees a
flowering bush of such a kind or *vassikasumana* (jasmine) flowers,
etc., spread out, or a heap of white lotuses or lilies, white cloth or
colour element; and it also arises in a tin disk, a silver disk, and the
moon's disk.



[20.] Anyone else should make a kasiṇa, in the way already
described for the blue kasiṇa, with the white flowers already mentioned,
or with cloth or colour element. He should bring it to mind as "white,
white." The rest is as before.



\[THE LIGHT KASIṆA\]



[21.] Of the light kasiṇa it is said: "One who is learning the
light kasiṇa apprehends the sign in light in a hole in a wall, or in a
keyhole, or in a window opening." So firstly, when someone has merit,
having had previous practice, the sign arises in him when he sees the
circle thrown on a wall or a floor by sunlight or moonlight entering
through a hole in a wall, etc., or when he sees a circle thrown on the
ground by sunlight or moonlight coming through a gap in the branches of
a dense-leaved tree or through a gap in a hut made of closely packed
branches.



[22.]Anyone else should use that same kind of circle of
luminosity just described, developing it as "luminosity, luminosity" or
"light, light." If he cannot do so, he can light a lamp inside a pot,
close the pot's mouth, make a hole in it and place it with the hole
facing a wall. The lamplight coming out of the hole throws a circle on
the wall. He should develop that \[175\] as "light, light." This lasts
longer than the other kinds.



[23.]Here the learning sign is like the circle thrown on the
wall or the ground. The counterpart sign is like a compact bright
cluster of lights. The rest is as before.



[]



[]



\[THE LIMITED-SPACE KASIṆA\]



[24.] Of the limited-space kasiṇa it is said: "One who is
learning the space kasiṇa apprehends the sign in a hole in a wall, or in
a keyhole, or in a window opening." So firstly, when someone has merit,
having had previous practice, the sign arises in him when he sees any
\[such gap as a\] hole in a wall.



[25.]Anyone else should make a hole a span and four fingers
broad in a well- thatched hut, or in a piece of leather, or in a rush
mat, and so on. He should develop one of these, or a hole such as a hole
in a wall, as "space, space."



[26.]Here the learning sign resembles the hole together with
the wall, etc., that surrounds it. Attempts to extend it fail. The
counterpart sign appears only as a circle of space. Attempts to extend
it succeed. The rest should be understood as described under the earth
kasiṇa.5



\[GENERAL\]



[27.] He with Ten Powers, who all things did see, Tells ten
kasiṇas, each of which can be\
The cause of fourfold and of fivefold jhāna,\
The fine-material sphere's own master key.\
Now, knowing their descriptions and the way\
To tackle each and how they are developed,\
There are some further points that will repay\
Study, each with its special part to play.



[28.]Of these, the earth kasiṇa is the basis for such powers as
the state described as "Having been one, he becomes many" (D I 78),
etc., and stepping or standing or sitting on space or on water by
creating earth, and the acquisition of the bases of mastery (M II 13) by
the limited and measureless method.



[29.]The water kasiṇa is the basis for such powers as diving in
and out of the earth (D I 78), causing rain, storms, creating rivers and
seas, making the earth and rocks and palaces quake (M I 253).



5\. In the Suttas the first eight kasiṇas are the same as those given
here, and they are the only ones mentioned in the Dhammasaṅgaṇī
(§160--203) and Paṭisambhidā (Paṭis I 6). The Suttas give space and
consciousness as ninth and tenth respectively (M II 14-- 15; D III 268;
Netti 89, etc.). But these last two appear to coincide with the first
two immaterial states, that is, boundless space and boundless
consciousness. The light kasiṇa given here as ninth does not appear in
the Suttas. It is perhaps a development from the "perception of light"
(*āloka-saññā*) (A II 45). The limited-space kasiṇa given here as tenth
has perhaps been made "limited' in order to differentiate it from the
first immaterial state. The commentary on the consciousness kasiṇa (M-a
III 261) says nothing on this aspect. As to space, Vism-mhṭ (p. 373)
says: "The attainment of the immaterial states is not produced by means
of the space kasiṇa, and with the words 'ending with the white kasiṇa'
(XXI.2) the light kasiṇa is included in the white kasiṇa." For
description of space (*ākāsa*) see Dhs-a 325, Netti 29. Also Vism-mhṭ
(p. 393) defines space thus: "Wherever there is no obstruction, that is
called space." Again the *Majjhima Nikāya Þīkā* (commenting on MN 106)
remarks: "\[Sense desires\] are not called empty (*ritta*) in the sense
that space, which is entirely devoid of individual essence, is called
empty."



[]



[]



[30.]The fire kasiṇa is the basis for such powers as smoking,
flaming, causing showers of sparks, countering fire with fire, ability
to burn only what one wants to burn (S IV 290), \[176\] causing light
for the purpose of seeing visible objects with the divine eye, burning
up the body by means of the fire element at the time of attaining
Nibbāna (M-a IV 196).



[31.]The air kasiṇa is the basis for such powers as going with
the speed of the wind, causing wind storms.



[32.]The blue kasiṇa is the basis for such powers as creating
black forms, causing darkness, acquisition of the bases of mastery by
the method of fairness and ugliness, and attainment of the liberation by
the beautiful (see M II 12)



[33.] The yellow kasiṇa is the basis for such powers as
creating yellow forms, resolving that something shall be gold (S I 116),
acquisition of the bases of mastery in the way stated, and attainment of
the liberation by the beautiful.



[34.]The red kasiṇa is the basis for such powers as creating
red forms, acquisition of the bases of mastery in the way stated, and
attainment of the liberation by the beautiful.



[35.] The white kasiṇa is the basis for such powers as creating
white forms, banishing stiffness and torpor, dispelling darkness,
causing light for the purpose of seeing visible objects with the divine
eye.



[36.]The light kasiṇa is the basis for such powers as creating
luminous forms, banishing stiffness and torpor, dispelling darkness,
causing light for the purpose of seeing visible objects with the divine
eye.



[37.] The space kasiṇa is the basis for such powers as
revealing the hidden, maintaining postures inside the earth and rocks by
creating space inside them, travelling unobstructed through walls, and
so on.



[38.] The classification "above, below, around, exclusive,
measureless" applies to all kasiṇas; for this is said: "He perceives the
earth kasiṇa above, below, around, exclusive, measureless" (M II 14),
and so on.



[39.] Herein,  *above* is upwards towards the sky's level.
*Below* is downwards towards the earth's level. *Around* is marked off
all around like the perimeter of a field. For one extends a kasiṇa
upwards only, another downwards, another all round; or for some reason
another projects it thus as one who wants to see visible objects with
the divine eye projects light.** ** \[177\] Hence "above, below, around"
is said. The word *exclusive*, however, shows that anyone such state has
nothing to do with any other. Just as there is water and nothing else in
all directions for one who is actually in water, so too, the earth
kasiṇa is the earth kasiṇa only; it has nothing in common with any other
kasiṇa. Similarly in each instance.  *Measureless* means measureless
intentness. He is intent upon the entirety with his mind, taking no
measurements in this way: "This is its beginning, this is its middle."



[40.] No kasiṇa can be developed by any living being described
as follows: "Beings hindered by kamma, by defilement or by kamma-result,
who lack faith, zeal and understanding, will be incapable of entering
into the certainty of rightness in profitable states" (Vibh 341).



[]



[]



[41.]Herein, the words *hindered by kamma* refer to those who
possess bad kamma entailing immediate effect \[on rebirth\].6  *By
defilement*: who have fixed wrong view7 or are hermaphrodites or
eunuchs. *By kamma-result*: who have had a rebirth- linking with no
\[profitable\] root-cause or with only two \[profitable\] root-causes.
*Lack faith*: are destitute of faith in the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha.
*Zeal*: are destitute of zeal for the unopposed way. *Understanding*:
are destitute of mundane and supramundane right view. *Will be incapable
of entering into the certainty of rightness in profitable states* means
that they are incapable of entering into the noble path called
"certainty" and "rightness in profitable states."



[42.]And this does not apply only to kasiṇas; for none of them
will succeed in developing any meditation subject at all. So the task of
devotion to a meditation subject must be undertaken by a clansman who
has no hindrance by kamma- result, who shuns hindrance by kamma and by
defilement, and who fosters faith, zeal and understanding by listening
to the Dhamma, frequenting good men, and so on.



The fifth chapter called "The Description of the Remaining Kasiṇas" in
the Treatise on the Development\
of Concentration in the *Path of Purification* composed for the purpose
of gladdening good people.



6\. The five kinds of bad kamma with immediate effect on rebirth are, in
that order of priority: matricide, parricide, arahanticide, intentional
shedding of a Buddha's blood, and causing a  schism in the Community,
all of which cause rebirth in hell and remaining there for the remainder
of the aeon (*kappa*), whatever other kinds of kamma may have been
performed (M-a IV 109f.).\



7\. The no-cause view, moral-inefficacy-of-action view, the nihilistic
view that there is no such thing as giving, and so on (see DN 2).

## CHAPTER VI 


FOULNESS AS A MEDITATION SUBJECT



(*Asubha-kammaṭṭhāna-niddesa*)



\[GENERAL  DEFINITIONS\]



[1.] \[178\] Now, ten kinds of foulness, \[as corpses\] without
consciousness, were listed next after the kasiṇas thus: the bloated, the
livid, the festering, the cut up, the gnawed, the scattered, the hacked
and scattered, the bleeding, the worm infested, a skeleton (III.105).



*The bloated*: it is bloated (*uddhumāta*) because bloated by gradual
dilation and swelling after (*uddhaṃ*) the close of life, as a bellows
is with wind. What is bloated (*uddhumāta*) is the same as "the bloated"
(*uddhumātaka*). Or alternatively, what is bloated (*uddhumāta*) is vile
(*kucchita*) because of repulsiveness, thus it is "the bloated"
(*uddhumātaka*). This is a term for a corpse in that particular state.



[2.] *The livid*: what has patchy discolouration is called
livid (*vinīla*). What is livid is the same as "the livid" (*vinīlaka*).
Or alternatively, what is livid (*vinīla*) is vile (*kucchita*) because
of repulsiveness, thus it is "the livid" (*vinīlaka*).1 This is a term
for a corpse that is reddish-coloured in places where flesh is
prominent, whitish-coloured in places where pus has collected, but
mostly blue-black (*nīla*), as if draped with blue-black cloth in the
blue-black places.



[3.]*The festering*: what is trickling with pus in broken
places is festering (*vipubba*). What is festering is the same as "the
festering" (*vipubbaka*). Or alternatively, what is festering
(*vipubba*) is vile (*kucchita*) because of repulsiveness, thus it is
"the festering" (*vipubbaka*). This is a term for a corpse in that
particular state.



[4.]*The cut up*: what has been opened up2 by cutting it in two
is called cut up (*vicchidda*). What is cut up is the same as "the cut
up" (*vicchiddaka*). Or alternatively, what is cut up (*vicchidda*) is
vile (*kucchita*) because of repulsiveness, thus it is "the cut up"
(*vicchiddaka*). This is a term for a corpse cut in the middle. \[179\]



[5.]*The gnawed*: what has been chewed here and there in
various ways by dogs, jackals, etc., is what is gnawed (*vikkhāyita*).
What is gnawed is the same as "the gnawed" (*vikkhāyitaka*). Or
alternatively, what is gnawed (*vikkhāyita*) is vile



1\. It is not possible to render such associative and alliterative
derivations of meaning into English. They have nothing to do with the
historical development of words, and their purpose is purely mnemonic.\



2\. *Apavārita---*"opened up": not in PED.


[]



[]



(*kucchita*) because of repulsiveness, thus it is "the gnawed"
(*vikkhāyitaka*). This is a term for a corpse in that particular state.



[6.]*The scattered*: what is strewed about (*vividhaṃ khittaṃ*)
is scattered (*vikkhittaṃ*). What is scattered is the same as "the
scattered" (*vikkhittaka*). Or alternatively, what is scattered
(*vikkhitta*) is vile (*kucchita*) because of repulsiveness, thus it is
"the scattered" (*vikkhittaka*). This is a term for a corpse that is
strewed here and there in this way: "Here a hand, there a foot, there
the head" (cf. M I 58).



[7.] *The hacked and scattered*: it is hacked, and it is
scattered in the way just described, thus it is "hacked and scattered"
(*hata-vikkhittaka*). This is a term for a corpse scattered in the way
just described after it has been hacked with a knife in a crow's-foot
pattern on every limb.



[8.] *The bleeding*: it sprinkles (*kirati*), scatters, blood
(*lohita*), and it trickles here and there, thus it is "the bleeding"
(*lohitaka*). This is a term for a corpse smeared with trickling blood.



[9.]*The worm-infested*: it is maggots that are called worms
(*puḷuva*); it sprinkles worms (*puḷuve kirati*), thus it is
worm-infested (*puḷuvaka*). This is a term for a corpse full of maggots.



[10.] *A skeleton*: bone (*aṭṭhi*) is the same as skeleton
(*aṭṭhika*). Or alternatively, bone (*aṭṭhi*) is vile (*kucchita*)
because of repulsiveness, thus it is a skeleton (*aṭṭhika*). This is a
term both for a single bone and for a framework of bones.



[11.]These names are also used both for the signs that arise
with the bloated, etc., as their support, and for the jhānas obtained in
the signs.



\[THE  BLOATED\]



[12.]Herein, when a meditator wants to develop the jhāna called
"of the bloated" by arousing the sign of the bloated on a bloated body,
he should in the way already described approach a teacher of the kind
mentioned under the earth kasiṇa and learn the meditation subject from
him. In explaining the meditation subject to him, the teacher should
explain it all, that is, the directions for going with the aim of
acquiring the sign of foulness, the characterizing of the surrounding
signs, the eleven ways of apprehending the sign, the reviewing of the
path gone by and come by, concluding with the directions for absorption.
And when the meditator has learnt it all well, he should go to an abode
of the kind already described and live there while seeking the sign of
the bloated.



[13.]Meanwhile, when he hears people saying that at some
village gate or on some road or at some forest's edge or at the base of
some rock or at the root of some tree \[180\] or on some charnel ground
a bloated corpse is lying, he should not go there at once, like one who
plunges into a river where there is no ford.



[14.] Why not? Because this foulness is beset by wild beasts
and non-human beings, and he might risk his life there. Or perhaps the
way to it goes by a village gate or a bathing place or an irrigated
field, and there a visible object of the opposite sex might come into
focus. Or perhaps the body is of the opposite sex; for a female body is
unsuitable for a man, and a male body for a woman. If only recently
dead, it may even look beautiful; hence there might be danger to the
life



[]



[]



of purity. But if he judges himself thus, "This is not difficult for one
like me," then he can go there.



[15.]And when he goes, he should do so only after he has spoken
to the senior elder of the Community or to some well-known bhikkhu.



[16.] Why? Because if all his limbs are seized with shuddering
at the charnel ground, or if his gorge rises when he is confronted with
disagreeable objects such as the visible forms and sounds of non-human
beings, lions, tigers, etc., or something else afflicts him, then he
whom he told will have his bowl and robe well looked after in the
monastery, or he will care for him by sending young bhikkhus or novices
to him.



[17.]Besides, robbers may meet there thinking a charnel ground
a safe place for them whether or not they have done anything wrong. And
when men chase them, they drop their goods near the bhikkhu and run
away. Perhaps the men seize the bhikkhu, saying "We have found the thief
with the goods," and bully him. Then he whom he told will explain to the
men "Do not bully him; he went to do this special work after telling
me," and he will rescue him. This is the advantage of going only after
informing someone.



[18.]Therefore he should inform a bhikkhu of the kind described
and then set out eager to see the sign, and as happy and joyful as a
warrior-noble (*khattiya*) on his way to the scene of anointing, as one
going to offer libations at the hall of sacrifice, or as a pauper on his
way to unearth a hidden treasure. And he should go there in the way
advised by the Commentaries.



[19.] For this is said: "One who is learning the bloated sign
of foulness goes alone with no companion, with unremitting mindfulness
established, with his sense faculties turned inwards, with his mind not
turned outwards, reviewing the path gone by and come by. In the place
where the bloated sign of foulness \[181\] has been left he notes any
stone or termite-mound or tree or bush or creeper there each with its
particular sign and in relation to the object. When he has done this, he
characterizes the bloated sign of foulness by the fact of its having
attained that particular individual essence. (see §84) Then he sees that
the sign is properly apprehended, that it is properly remembered, that
it is properly defined, by its colour, by its mark, by its shape, by its
direction, by its location, by its delimitation, by its joints, by its
openings, by its concavities, by its convexities, and all round.



[20.] "When he has properly apprehended the sign, properly
remembered it, properly defined it, he goes alone with no companion,
with unremitting mindfulness established, with his sense faculties
turned inwards, with his mind not turned outwards, reviewing the path
gone by and come by. When he walks, he resolves that his walk is
oriented towards it; when he sits, he prepares a seat that is oriented
towards it.



[21.] "What is the purpose, what is the advantage of
characterizing the surrounding signs? Characterizing the surrounding
signs has non-delusion for its purpose, it has non-delusion for its
advantage. What is the purpose, what is the advantage of apprehending
the sign in the \[other\] eleven ways?



[]



[]



Apprehending the sign in the \[other\] eleven ways has anchoring \[the
mind\] for its purpose, it has anchoring \[the mind\] for its advantage.
What is the purpose, what is the advantage of reviewing the path gone by
and come by? Reviewing the path gone by and come by has keeping \[the
mind\] on the track for its purpose, it has keeping \[the mind\] on the
track for its advantage.



[22.]"When he has established reverence for it by seeing its
advantages and by perceiving it as a treasure and so come to love it, he
anchors his mind upon that object: 'Surely in this way I shall be
liberated from ageing and death.' Quite secluded from sense desires,
secluded from unprofitable things he enters upon and dwells in the first
jhāna *...* \[seclusion\]. He has arrived at the first jhāna of the
fine-material sphere. His is a heavenly abiding and an instance of the
meritorious action consisting in \[meditative\] development." (*Source
untraced.*)



[23.]So if he goes to the charnel ground to test his control of
mind, let him do so after striking the gong or summoning a chapter. If
he goes there mainly for \[developing that\] meditation subject, let him
go alone with no companion, without renouncing his basic meditation
subject and keeping it always in mind, taking a walking stick or a staff
to keep off attacks by dogs, etc., \[182\] ensuring unremitting
mindfulness by establishing it well, with his mind not turned outwards
because he has ensured that his faculties, of which his mind is the
sixth, are turned inwards.



[24.]As he goes out of the monastery he should note the gate:
"I have gone out in such a direction by such a gate." After that he
should define the path by which he goes: "This path goes in an easterly
direction *...* westerly *...* northerly *...* southerly direction" or
"It goes in an intermediate direction"; and "In this place it goes to
the left, in this place to the right"; and "In this place there is a
stone, in this a termite- mound, in this a tree, in this a bush, in this
a creeper." He should go to the place where the sign is, defining in
this way the path by which he goes.



[25.]And he should not approach it upwind; for if he did so and
the smell of corpses assailed his nose, his brain3 might get upset, or
he might throw up his food, or he might repent his coming, thinking
"What a place of corpses I have come to!" So instead of approaching it
upwind, he should go downwind. If he cannot go by a downwind path---if
there is a mountain or a ravine or a rock or a fence or a patch of
thorns or water or a bog in the way---then he should go stopping his
nose with the corner of his robe. These are the duties in going.



[26.]When he has gone there in this way, he should not at once
look at the sign of foulness; he should make sure of the direction. For
perhaps if he stands in a certain direction, the object does not appear
clearly to him and his mind is not wieldy. So rather than there he
should stand where the object appears clearly and his mind is wieldy.
And he should avoid standing to leeward or to windward of it. For if he
stands to leeward he is bothered by the corpse smell and his mind
strays; and if he stands to windward and non-human beings are dwelling
there,



3\. This does not imply what we, now, might suppose. See the description
of "brain" in VIII.126 and especially VIII.136. What is meant is perhaps
that he might get a cold or catarrh.

they may get annoyed and do him a mischief. So he should move round a
little and not stand too much to windward. \[183\]



[27.]Then he should stand not too far off or too near, or too
much towards the feet or the head. For if he stands too far off, the
object is not clear to him, and if he stands too near, he may get
frightened. If he stands too much towards the feet or the head, not all
the foulness becomes manifest to him equally. So he should stand not too
far off or too near, opposite the middle of the body, in a place
convenient for him to look at it.



[28.]Then he should characterize the surrounding signs in the
way stated thus: "In the place where the bloated sign of foulness has
been left he notes any stone *...* or creeper there with its sign"
(§19).



[29.] These are the directions for characterizing them. If
there is a rock in the eye's focus near the sign, he should define it in
this way: "This rock is high or low, small or large, brown or black or
white, long or round," after which he should observe \[the relative
positions\] thus: "In this place, this is a rock, this is the sign of
foulness; this is the sign of foulness, this is a rock."



[30.]If there is a termite-mound, he should define it in this
way: "This is high or low, small or large, brown or black or white, long
or round," after which he should observe \[the relative positions\]
thus: "In this place, this is a termite- mound, this is the sign of
foulness."



[31.]If there is a tree, he should define it in this way: "This
is a pipal fig tree or a banyan fig tree or a *kacchaka* fig tree or a
*kapittha* fig tree; it is tall or short, small or large, black or
white," after which he should observe \[the relative positions\] thus:
"In this place, this is a tree, this is the sign of foulness."



[32.]If there is a bush, he should define it in this way: "This
is a *sindi* bush or a *karamanda* bush or a *kaṇavīra* bush or a
*koraṇḍaka* bush; it is tall or short, small or large," after which he
should observe \[the relative positions\] thus: "In this place, this is
a bush, this is the sign of foulness."



[33.]If there is a creeper, he should define it in this way:
"This is a pumpkin creeper or a gourd creeper or a brown creeper or a
black creeper or a stinking creeper," after which he should observe
\[the relative positions\] thus: "In this place, this is a creeper, this
is the sign of foulness; this is the sign of foulness, this is a
creeper."



[34.] Also  *with its particular sign and in relation to the
object* was said (§19); but that is included by what has just been said;
for he "characterizes it with its particular sign" when he defines it
again and again, and he "characterizes it in relation to the object"
when he defines it by combining it each time in pairs thus: "This is a
rock, this is the sign of foulness; this is the sign of foulness, this
is a rock."



[35.] Having done this, again he should bring to mind the fact
that it has an individual essence, its own state of being bloated, which
is not common to anything else, since it was said that he defines4 it
*by the fact of its having attained*



4\. Reference back to §19 requires *sabhāvato upalakkhati* rather than
*sabhāvato vavaṭṭhāpeti*, but so the readings have it.



[]



[]



*that particular individual essence*. The meaning is that it should be
defined according to individual essence, according to its own nature, as
"the inflated,5 the bloated."



Having defined it in this way, he should apprehend the sign in the
following six ways, that is to say, (1) by its colour, (2) by its mark,
(3) by its shape, \[184\] (4) by its direction, (5) by its location, (6)
by its delimitation. How?



[36.](1) The meditator should define it *by its colour* thus:
"This is the body of one who is black or white or yellow-skinned."



[37.](2) Instead of defining it by the female mark or the male
mark, he should define it *by its mark* thus: "This is the body of one
who was in the first phase of life, in the middle phase, in the last
phase."



[38.](3)  *By its shape*: he should define it only by the shape
of the bloated thus: "This is the shape of its head, this is the shape
of its neck, this is the shape of its hand, this is the shape of its
chest, this is the shape of its belly, this is the shape of its navel,
this is the shape of its hips, this is the shape of its thigh, this is
the shape of its calf, this is the shape of its foot."



[39.](4) He should define it *by its direction* thus: "There
are two directions in this body, that is, down from the navel as the
lower direction, and up from it as the upper direction." Or
alternatively, he can define it thus: "I am standing in this direction;
the sign of foulness is in that direction."



[40.](5) He should define it *by its location* thus: "The hand
is in this location, the foot in this, the head in this, the middle of
the body in this." Or alternatively, he can define it thus: "I am in
this location; the sign of foulness is in that."



[41.] (6) He should define it *by its delimitation* thus: "This
body is delimited below by the soles of the feet, above by the tips of
the hair, all round by the skin; the space so delimited is filled up
with thirty-two pieces of corpse." Or alternatively, he can define it
thus: "This is the delimitation of its hand, this is the delimitation of
its foot, this is the delimitation of its head, this is the delimitation
of the middle part of its body." Or alternatively, he can delimit as
much of it as he has apprehended thus: "Just this much of the bloated is
like this."



[42.] However, a female body is not appropriate for a man or a
male one for a woman; for the object, \[namely, the repulsive aspect\],
does not make its appearance in a body of the opposite sex, which merely
becomes a condition for the wrong kind of excitement.6 To quote the
Majjhima Commentary: "Even



5\. *Vaṇita---*"inflated": glossed by Vism-mhṭ with *sūna* (swollen).
Not in PED in this sense.



6\. *Vipphandana---*"wrong kind of excitement": Vism-mhṭ says here
"*Kilesa-* *paripphandanass' eva nimittaṃ hotī ti attho* (the meaning
is, it becomes the sign for interference by (activity of) defilement"
(Vism-mhṭ 170). *Phandati* and *vipphandati* are both given only such
meanings as "to throb, stir, twitch" and *paripphandati* is not in PED.
For the sense of wrong (*vi*-) excitement (*phandana*) cf. IV.89 and
XIV.132 and note. There seems to be an association of meaning between
*vipphāra, vyāpāra, vipphandana, īhaka*, and *paripphandana* (perhaps
also *ābhoga*) in the general senses of interestedness, activity,
concern, interference, intervention, etc.

when decaying,7 a woman invades a man's mind and stays there." That is
why the sign should be apprehended in the six ways only in a body of the
same sex.



[43.] But when a clansman has cultivated the meditation subject
under former Enlightened Ones, kept the ascetic practices, threshed out
the great primary elements, discerned formations, defined
mentality-materiality, eliminated the perception of a being, done the
ascetic's \[185\] duties, lived the moral life, and developed the
development, when he contains the seed \[of turning away from
formations\], and has mature knowledge and little defilement, then the
counterpart sign appears to him in the place while he keeps looking. If
it does not appear in that way, then it appears to him as he is
apprehending the sign in the six ways.



[44.]But if it does not appear to him even then, he should
apprehend the sign again in five more ways: (7) by its joints, (8) by
its openings, (9) by its concavities, (10) by its convexities, and (11)
all round.



[45.]Herein, (7) *by its joints* is \[properly\] by its hundred
and eighty joints. But how can he define the hundred and eighty joints
in the bloated? Consequently he can define it by its fourteen major
joints thus: Three joints in the right arm, three in the left arm, three
in the right leg, three in the left leg, one neck joint, one waist
joint.



[46.](8)  *By its openings*: an "opening" is the hollow between
the arm \[and the side\], the hollow between the legs, the hollow of the
stomach, the hollow of the ear. He should define it by its openings in
this way. Or alternatively, the opened or closed state of the eyes and
the opened or closed state of the mouth can be defined.



[47.](9) *By its concavities*: he should define any concave
place on the body such as the eye sockets or the inside of the mouth or
the base of the neck. Or he can define it thus: "I am standing in a
concave place, the body is in a convex place."



[48.](10) *By its convexities*: he should define any raised
place on the body such as the knee or the chest or the forehead. Or he
can define it thus: "I am standing in a convex place, the body is in a
concave place."



[49.] (11) *All round*: the whole body should be defined all
round. After working over the whole body with knowledge, he should
establish his mind thus, "The bloated, the bloated," upon any part that
appears clearly to him. If it has not appeared even yet, and if there is
special intensity of the bloatedness in the belly,8 he should establish
his mind thus, "The bloated, the bloated," on that.



[50.] Now, as to the words, *he sees that the sign is properly
apprehended*, etc., the explanation is this. The meditator should
apprehend the sign thoroughly in that body in the way of apprehending
the sign already described. He should



7\. The Harvard text has *ugghāṭita*, but Vism-mhṭ (p. 170) reads
"*ugghāṇitā * (not in PED) *pī-tī uddhumātakabhāvappattā pi sabbaso
kuthita-sarīrā-pī-ti attho*."



8\. "*Udara-pariyosānaṃ uparisarīram*" (Vism-mhṭ 172). *Pariyosāna* here
means "intensity" though normally it means "end"; but see PED

[]



advert to it with well-established mindfulness. He should see that it is
properly remembered, properly defined, by doing that again and again.
Standing in a place not too far from and not too near to the body, he
should open his eyes, look and apprehend the sign. \[186\] He should
open his eyes and look a hundred times, a thousand times, \[thinking\],
"Repulsiveness of the bloated, repulsiveness of the bloated," and he
should close his eyes and advert to it.



[51.] As he does so again and again, the learning sign becomes
properly apprehended by him. When is it properly apprehended? When it
comes into focus alike whether he opens his eyes and looks or closes his
eyes and adverts, then it is called properly apprehended.



[52.]When he has thus properly apprehended the sign, properly
remembered it, and properly defined it, then if he is unable to conclude
his development on the spot, he can go to his own lodging, alone, in the
same way as described of his coming, with no companion, keeping that
same meditation subject in mind, with mindfulness well established, and
with his mind not turned outwards owing to his faculties being turned
inwards.



[53.]As he leaves the charnel ground he should define the path
he comes back by thus: "The path by which I have left goes in an
easterly direction, westerly *...* northerly  *...* southerly
direction," or "It goes in an intermediate direction"; or "In this place
it goes to the left, in this place to the right"; and "In this place
there is a stone, in this a termite-mound, in this a tree, in this a
bush, in this a creeper."



[54.]When he has defined the path he has come back by and when,
once back, he is walking up and down, he should see that his walk is
oriented towards it too; the meaning is that he should walk up and down
on a piece of ground that faces in the direction of the sign of
foulness. And when he sits, he should prepare a seat oriented towards it
too.



[55.] But if there is a bog or a ravine or a tree or a fence or
a swamp in that direction, if he cannot walk up and down on a piece of
ground facing in that direction, if he cannot prepare his seat thus
because there is no room for it, then he can both walk up and down and
sit in a place where there is room, even though it does not face that
way; but he should turn his mind in that direction.



[56.]Now, as to the questions beginning with *what is the
purpose ...* *characterizing the surrounding signs*? The intention of
the answer that begins with the words, *has non-delusion for its
purpose*, is this: If someone goes at the wrong time to the place where
the sign of the bloated is, and opens his eyes for the purpose of
apprehending the sign by characterizing the surrounding signs, then as
soon as he looks the dead body appears \[187\] as if it were standing up
and threatening9 and pursuing him, and when he sees the hideous and
fearful object, his mind reels, he is like one demented, gripped by
panic, fear and terror, and his hair stands on end. For among the
thirty-eight meditation subjects expounded in the texts no object is so
frightening as this one. There are some who lose jhāna in this
meditation subject. Why? Because it is so frightening.



9\. There is no sense of *ajjhottharati* given in PED that fits here.
Cf. I.56.



[]



[]



[57.] So the meditator must stand firm. Establishing his
mindfulness well, he should remove his fears in this way: "No dead body
gets up and pursues one. If that stone or that creeper close to it were
to come, the body might come too; but since that stone or that creeper
does not come, the body will not come either. Its appearance to you in
this way is born: of your perception, created by your perception. Today
your meditation subject has appeared to you. Do not be afraid, bhikkhu."
He should laugh it off and direct his mind to the sign. In that way he
will arrive at distinction. The words "Characterizing the surrounding
signs has non-delusion for its purpose" are said on this account.



[58.]To succeed in apprehending the sign in the eleven ways is
to anchor the meditation subject. For the opening of his eyes and
looking conditions the arising of the learning sign; and as he exercises
his mind on that the counterpart sign arises; and as he exercises his
mind on that he reaches absorption. When he is sure of absorption, he
works up insight and realizes Arahantship. Hence it was said:
*apprehending the sign in the* \[*other*\] *eleven ways has anchoring*
\[*the mind*\] *for its purpose*.



[59.]*The reviewing of the path gone by and come by has
keeping* \[*the mind*\] *on the track for its purpose*: the meaning is
that the reviewing of the path gone by and of the path come back by
mentioned is for the purpose of keeping properly to the track of the
meditation subject.



[60.]For if this bhikkhu is going along with his meditation
subject and people on the way ask him about the day, "What is today,
venerable sir?" or they ask him some question \[about Dhamma\], or they
welcome him, he ought not to go on in silence, thinking "I have a
meditation subject." The day must be told, the question must be
answered, even by saying "I do not know" if he does not know, a
legitimate welcome must be responded to. \[188\] As he does so, the
newly acquired sign vanishes. But even if it does vanish, he should
still tell the day when asked; if he does not know the answer to the
question, he should still say "I do not know," and if he does know it,
he should explain it surely;10 and he must respond to a welcome. Also
reception of visitors must be attended to on seeing a visiting bhikkhu,
and all the remaining duties in the Khandhakas must be carried out too,
that is, the duties of the shrine terrace, the duties of the Bodhi-tree
terrace, the duties of the Uposatha house, the duties of the refectory
and the bath house, and those to the teacher, the preceptor, visitors,
departing bhikkhus, and the rest.



[61.]And the newly acquired sign vanishes while he is carrying
out these too. When he wants to go again, thinking "I shall go and take
up the sign," he finds he cannot go to the charnel ground because it has
been invaded by non-human beings or by wild beasts, or the sign has
disappeared. For a bloated corpse only lasts one or two days and then
turns into a livid corpse. Of all the meditation subjects there is none
so hard to come by as this.



[62.]So when the sign has vanished in this way, the bhikkhu
should sit down in his night quarters or in his day quarters and first
of all review the path gone by and come by up to the place where he is
actually sitting cross-legged, doing it in



10\. Reading *ekaṃsena* (surely) with Harvard text rather than
*ekadesena* (partly).



[]



[]



this way: "I went out of the monastery by this gate, I took a path
leading in such and such a direction, I turned left at such and such a
place, I turned right at such and such a place, in one part of it there
was a stone, in another a termite-mound or a tree or a bush or a
creeper; having gone by that path, I saw the foulness in such and such a
place, I stood there facing in such and such a direction and observed
such and such surrounding signs, I apprehended the sign of foulness in
this way; I left the charnel ground in such and such a direction, I came
back by such and such a path doing this and this, and I am now sitting
here."



[63.] As he reviews it in this way, the sign becomes evident
and appears as if placed in front of him; the meditation subject rides
in its track as it did before. Hence it was said: *the reviewing of the
path gone by and come by has keeping* \[*the mind*\] *on the track for
its purpose*.



[64.]Now, as to the words, when he has established reverence
for it by seeing its advantages and by perceiving it as a treasure and
so come to love it, he anchors the mind on that object: here, having
gained jhāna by exercising his mind on the repulsiveness in the bloated,
he should increase insight with the jhāna as its proximate cause, and
then he should see the advantages in this way: \[189\] "Surely in this
way I shall be liberated from ageing and death."



[65.]Just as a pauper who acquired a treasure of gems would
guard and love it with great affection, feeling reverence for it as one
who appreciates the value of it, "I have got what is hard indeed to
get!" so too \[this bhikkhu\] should guard the sign, loving it and
feeling reverence for it as one who appreciates the value of it, "I have
got this meditation subject, which is indeed as hard to get as a very
valuable treasure is for a pauper to get. For one whose meditation
subject is the four elements discerns the four primary elements in
himself, one whose meditation subject is breathing discerns the wind in
his own nostrils, and one whose meditation subject is a kasiṇa makes a
kasiṇa and develops it at his ease, so these other meditation subjects
are easily got. But this one lasts only one, or two days, after which it
turns into a livid corpse. There is none harder to get than this one."
In his night quarters and in his day quarters he should keep his mind
anchored there thus, "Repulsiveness of the bloated, repulsiveness of the
bloated." And he should advert to the sign, bring it to mind and strike
at it with thought and applied thought over and over again.



[66.]As he does so, the counterpart sign arises. Here is the
difference between the two signs. The learning sign appears as a
hideous, dreadful and frightening sight; but the counterpart sign
appears like a man with big limbs lying down after eating his fill.



[67.] Simultaneously with his acquiring the counterpart sign,
his lust is abandoned by suppression owing to his giving no attention
externally to sense desires \[as object\]. And owing to his abandoning
of approval, ill will is abandoned too, as pus is with the abandoning of
blood. Likewise stiffness and torpor are abandoned through exertion of
energy, agitation and worry are abandoned through devotion to peaceful
things that cause no remorse; and uncertainty about the Master who
teaches the way, about the way, and about the fruit of the way, is
abandoned through the actual experience of the distinction attained. So



[]



[]



the five hindrances are abandoned. And there are present applied thought
with the characteristic of directing the mind on to that same sign, and
sustained thought accomplishing the function of pressing on the sign,
and happiness due to the acquisition of distinction, and tranquillity
due to the production of tranquillity in one whose mind is happy, and
bliss with that tranquillity as its sign, \[190\] and unification that
has bliss as its sign due to the production of concentration in one
whose mind is blissful. So the jhāna factors become manifest.



[68.]Thus access, which is the obverse of the first jhāna, is
produced in him too at that same moment. All after that up to absorption
in the first jhāna and mastery in it should be understood as described
under the earth kasiṇa.



[69.] As regards the livid and the rest: the characterizing
already described, starting with the going in the way beginning "One who
is learning the bloated sign of foulness goes alone with no companion,
with unremitting mindfulness established" (§19), should all be
understood with its exposition and intention, substituting for the word
"bloated" the appropriate word in each case thus: "One who is learning
the livid sign of foulness *...*", "One who is learning the festering
sign of foulness *...*" But the differences are as follows.



\[THE LIVID\]



[70.] *The livid* should be brought to mind as "Repulsiveness
of the livid, repulsiveness of the livid." Here the learning sign
appears blotchy-coloured; but the counterpart sign's appearance has the
colour which is most prevalent.



\[THE  FESTERING\]



[71.]*The festering* should be brought to mind as
"Repulsiveness of the festering, repulsiveness of the festering." Here
the learning sign appears as though trickling; but the counterpart sign
appears motionless and quiet.



\[THE CUT UP\]



[72.]*The cut up* is found on a battlefield or in a robbers'
forest or on a charnel ground where kings have robbers cut up or in the
jungle in a place where men are torn up by lions and tigers. So, if when
he goes there, it comes into focus at one adverting although lying in
different places, that is good. If not, then he should not touch it with
his own hand; for by doing so he would become familiar with it.11 He
should get a monastery attendant or one studying to become an ascetic or
someone else to put it together in one place. If he cannot find anyone
to do it, he should put it together with a walking stick or a staff in
such a way that there is only a finger's breadth separating \[the
parts\]. Having put it together thus, he should bring it to mind as
"Repulsiveness of the cut up, repulsiveness of the cut up." Herein, the
learning sign appears as though cut in the middle; but the counterpart
sign appears whole. \[191\]



11\. "He would come to handle it without disgust as a corpse-burner
would" (Vism-mhṭ 176.).



[]



[]



\[THE  GNAWED\]



[73.] *The gnawed* should be brought to mind as "Repulsiveness
of the gnawed, repulsiveness of the gnawed." Here the learning sign
appears as though gnawed here and there; but the counterpart sign
appears whole.



\[THE  SCATTERED\]



[74.] After getting *the scattered* put together or putting it
together in the way described under the cut up so that there is only a
finger's breadth, separating \[the pieces\], it should be brought to
mind as "Repulsiveness of the scattered, repulsiveness of the
scattered." Here the learning sign appears with the gaps evident; but
the counterpart sign appears whole.



\[THE HACKED  AND  SCATTERED\]



[75.] *The hacked and scattered* is found in the same places as
those described under the cut up. Therefore, after going there and
getting it put together or putting it together in the way described
under the cut up so that there is only a finger's breadth separating
\[the pieces\], it should be brought to mind as "Repulsiveness of the
hacked and scattered, repulsiveness of the hacked and scattered." Here,
when the learning sign becomes evident, it does so with the fissures of
the wounds; but the counterpart sign appears whole.



\[THE  BLEEDING\]



[76.]*The bleeding* is found at the time when \[blood\] is
trickling from the openings of wounds received on battlefields, etc., or
from the openings of burst boils and abscesses when the hands and feet
have been cut off. So on seeing that, it should be brought to mind as
"Repulsiveness of the bleeding, repulsiveness of the bleeding." Here the
learning sign appears to have the aspect of moving like a red banner
struck by wind; but the counterpart sign appears quiet.



\[THE  WORM-INFESTED\]



[77.]There is a *worm-infested* corpse when at the end of two
or three days a mass of maggots oozes out from the corpse's nine
orifices, and the mass lies there like a heap of paddy or boiled rice as
big as the body, whether the body is that of a dog, a jackal, a human
being,12 an ox, a buffalo, an elephant, a horse, a python, or what you
will. It can be brought to mind with respect to anyone of these as
"Repulsiveness of the worm-infested, repulsiveness of the
worm-infested." For the sign arose for the Elder Cūḷa-Piṇḍapātika-Tissa
in the corpse of an elephant's carcass in the Kāḷadīghavāpi reservoir.
Here the learning sign appears as though moving; but the counterpart
sign appears quiet, like a ball of boiled rice.



\[A SKELETON\]



[78.]*A skeleton* is described in various aspects in the way
beginning "As though he were looking at a corpse thrown onto a charnel
ground, a skeleton with flesh



12\. Reading *manussa* with Sinhalese ed.



[]



[]



and blood, held together by sinews" (D II 296). \[192\] So he should go
in the way already described to where it has been put, and noticing any
stones, etc., with their surrounding signs and in relation, to the
object, he should characterize it *by the fact of its having attained
that particular individual essence* thus, "This is a skeleton," and he
should apprehend the sign in the eleven ways by colour and the rest. But
if he looks at it, \[apprehending it only\] by its colour as white, it
does not appear to him \[with its individual essence as repulsive\], but
only as a variant of the white kasiṇa. Consequently he should only look
at it as 'a skeleton' in the repulsive aspect.



[79.]"Mark" is a term for the hand, etc., here, so he should
define it *by its mark* according to hand, foot, head, chest, arm,
waist, thigh, and shin. He should define it *by its shape*, however,
according as it is long, short, square, round, small or large. *By its
direction and by its location* are as already described (§39--40).
Having defined it *by its delimitation* according to the periphery of
each bone, he should reach absorption by apprehending whichever appears
most evident to him. But it can also be defined *by its concavities* and
*by its convexities* according to the concave and convex places in each
bone. And it can also be defined by position thus: "I am standing in a
concave place, the skeleton is in a convex place; or I am standing in a
convex place, the skeleton is in a concave place." It should be defined
*by its joints* according as any two bones are joined together. It
should be defined *by its openings* according to the gaps separating the
bones. It should be defined *all round* by directing knowledge to it
comprehensively thus: "In this place there is this skeleton." If the
sign does not arise even in this way, then the mind should be
established on the frontal bone. And in this case, just as in the case
of those that precede it beginning with the worm-infested, the
apprehending of the sign should be observed in this elevenfold manner as
appropriate.



[80.]This meditation subject is successful with a whole
skeleton frame and even with a single bone as well. So having learnt the
sign in anyone of these in the eleven ways, he should bring it to mind
as "Repulsiveness of a skeleton, repulsiveness of a skeleton." Here the
learning sign and the counterpart sign are alike, so it is said. That is
correct for a single bone. But when the learning sign becomes manifest
in a skeleton frame, what is correct \[to say\] is that there are gaps
in the learning sign while the counterpart sign appears whole. \[193\]
And the learning sign even in a single bone should be dreadful and
terrifying but the counterpart sign produces happiness and joy because
it brings access.



[81.] What is said in the Commentaries in this context allows
that deduction. For there, after saying this, "There is no counterpart
sign in the four divine abidings and in the ten kinds of foulness; for
in the case of the divine abidings the sign is the breaking down of
boundaries itself, and in the case of the ten kinds of foulness the sign
comes into being as soon as the repulsiveness is seen, without any
thinking about it," it is again said, immediately next: "Here the sign
is twofold: the learning sign and the counterpart sign. The learning
sign appears hideous, dreadful and terrifying," and so on. So what we
said was well considered. And it is only this that is correct here.
Besides, the appearance of a



[]

woman's whole body as a collection of bones to the Elder Mahā-Tissa
through his merely looking at her teeth demonstrates this here (see
I.55).

[83.]One who has reached jhāna in anyone of these goes free
from cupidity; he resembles \[an Arahant\] without greed because his
greed has been well suppressed. At the same time, however, this
classification of foulness should be understood as stated in accordance
with the particular individual essences successively reached by the
\[dead\] body and also in accordance with the particular subdivisions of
the greedy temperament.



[84.]When a corpse has entered upon the repulsive state, it may
have reached the individual essence of the bloated or anyone of the
individual essences beginning with that of the livid. So the sign should
be apprehended as "Repulsiveness of the bloated," "Repulsiveness of the
livid," according to whichever he has been able to find. This, it should
be understood, is how the classification of foulness comes to be tenfold
with the body's arrival at each particular individual essence.



[85.]And individually *the bloated* suits one who is greedy
about shape since it makes evident the disfigurement of the body's
shape. *The livid* suits one who is greedy about the body's colour since
it makes evident the disfigurement of the skin's colour. *The festering*
\[194\] suits one who is greedy about the smell of the body aroused by
scents, perfumes, etc., since it makes evident the evil smells connected
with this sore, the body. *The cut up* suits one who is greedy about
compactness in the body since it makes evident the hollowness inside it.
*The gnawed* suits one who is greedy about accumulation of flesh in such
parts of the body as the breasts since it makes it evident how a fine
accumulation of flesh comes to nothing. *The scattered* suits one who is
greedy about the grace of the limbs since it makes it evident how limbs
can be scattered. *The hacked* and scattered suits one who is greedy
about a fine body as a whole since it makes evident the disintegration
and alteration of the body as a whole. *The bleeding* suits one who is
greedy about elegance produced by ornaments since it makes evident its
repulsiveness when smeared with blood. *The worm-infested* suits one who
is greedy about ownership of the body since it makes it evident how the
body is shared with many families of worms. *A skeleton* suits one who
is greedy about fine teeth since it makes evident the repulsiveness of
the bones in the body. This, it should be understood, is how the
classification of foulness comes to be tenfold according to the
subdivisions of the greedy temperament.

[86.]But as regards the tenfold foulness, just as it is only by
virtue of its rudder that a boat keeps steady in a river with
turbulent13 waters and a rapid current, and it cannot be steadied
without a rudder, so too \[here\], owing to the weak hold on the object,
consciousness when unified only keeps steady by virtue of applied
thought, and it cannot be steadied without applied thought, which is why
there is only the first jhāna here, not the second and the rest.



[87.]And repulsive as this object is, still it arouses joy and
happiness in him by his seeing its advantages thus, "*Surely in this way
I shall be liberated from ageing and death*," and by his abandoning the
hindrances' oppression; just as a garbage heap does in a
flower-scavenger by his seeing the advantages thus, "Now I shall get a
high wage," and as the workings of purges and emetics do in a man
suffering the pains of sickness.



[88.]This foulness, while of ten kinds, has only one
characteristic. For though it is of ten kinds, nevertheless its
characteristic is only its impure, stinking, disgusting and repulsive
state (essence). And foulness appears with this characteristic not only
in a dead body but also in a living one, as it did to the Elder
Mahā-Tissa who lived at Cetiyapabbata (I.55), and to the novice
attendant on the Elder Saṅgharakkhita while he was watching the king
riding an elephant. For a living body is just as foul as a dead one,
\[195\] only the characteristic of foulness is not evident in a living
body, being hidden by adventitious embellishments.



[89.] This is the body's nature: it is a collection of over
three hundred bones, jointed by one hundred and eighty joints, bound
together by nine hundred sinews, plastered over with nine hundred pieces
of flesh, enveloped in the moist inner skin, enclosed in the outer
cuticle, with orifices here and there, constantly dribbling and
trickling like a grease pot, inhabited by a community of worms, the home
of disease, the basis of painful states, perpetually oozing from the
nine orifices like a chronic open carbuncle, from both of whose eyes
eye-filth trickles, from whose ears comes ear-filth, from whose nostrils
snot, from whose mouth food and bile and phlegm and blood, from whose
lower outlets excrement and urine, and from whose ninety-nine thousand
pores the broth of stale sweat seeps, with bluebottles and their like
buzzing round it, which when untended with tooth sticks and
mouth-washing and head-anointing and bathing and underclothing and
dressing would, judged by the universal repulsiveness of the body, make
even a king, if he wandered from village to village with his hair in its
natural wild disorder, no different from a flower-scavenger or an
outcaste or what you will. So there is no distinction between a king's
body and an outcaste's in so far as its impure stinking nauseating
repulsiveness is concerned.



[90.] But by rubbing out the stains on its teeth with tooth
sticks and mouth- washing and all that, by concealing its private parts
under several cloths, by daubing it with various scents and salves, by
pranking it with nosegays and such things, it is worked up into a state
that permits of its being taken as "I" and



13\. *Aparisaṇṭhita---*"turbulent." *Parisaṇṭhāti* (to quiet) is not in
PED. *Aparisaṇṭhita* is not in CPD.



[]



[]



"mine." So men delight in women and women in men without perceiving the
true nature of its characteristic foulness, now masked by this
adventitious adornment. But in the ultimate sense there is no place here
even the size of an atom fit to lust after.



[91.]And then, when any such bits of it as head hairs, body
hairs, nails, teeth, spittle, snot, excrement or urine have dropped off
the body, beings will not touch them; they are ashamed, humiliated and
disgusted. But as long as anyone of these things remains in it, though
it is just as repulsive, they take it as agreeable, desirable,
permanent, \[196\] pleasant, self, because they are wrapped in the murk
of ignorance and dyed with affection and greed for self. Taking it as
they do, they resemble the old jackal who saw a flower not yet fallen
from a *kiṃsuka* tree in a forest and yearned after it, thinking, "This
is a piece of meat, it is a piece of meat."



[92.] There was a jackal chanced to see A flowering *kiṃsuka*
in a wood;\
In haste he went to where it stood:\
"I have found a meat-bearing tree!"



He chewed the blooms that fell, but could,\
Of course, find nothing fit to eat;\
He took it thus: "Unlike the meat\
There on the tree, this is no good."



A wise man will not think to treat\
As foul only the part that fell,\
But treats as foul the part as well\
That in the body has its seat.



Fools cannot in their folly tell;\
They take the body to be fair,\
And soon get caught in Evil's snare\
Nor can escape its painful spell.



But since the wise have thus laid bare\
This filthy body's nature, so,\
Be it alive or dead, they know\
There is no beauty lurking there.



[93.] For this is said:



"This filthy body stinks outright\
Like ordure, like a privy's site;\
This body men that have insight\
Condemn, as object of a fool's delight.



"A tumour where nine holes abide\
Wrapped in a coat of clammy hide\
And trickling filth on every side,\
Polluting the air with stenches far and wide.



[]



[]



"If it perchance should come about\
That what is inside it came out,\
Surely a man would need a knout\
With which to put the crows and dogs to rout."



[94.] So a capable bhikkhu should apprehend the sign wherever
the aspect of foulness is manifest, whether in a living body or in a
dead one, and he should make the meditation subject reach absorption.

Subject" in the Treatise on the Development\
of Concentration in the *Path of Purification* composed for the purpose

## CHAPTER VII 


SIX RECOLLECTIONS



(*Cha-anussati-niddesa*)



[1.]\[197\] Now, ten recollections were listed next after the
ten kinds of foulness (III.105). As to these:



Mindfulness (*sati*) itself is recollection (*anussati*) because it
arises again and again; or alternatively, the mindfulness (*sati*) that
is proper (*anurūpa*) for a clansman gone forth out of faith, since it
occurs only in those instances where it should occur, is "recollection"
(*anussati*).



The recollection arisen inspired by the Enlightened One is the
*recollection of* *the Buddha*. This is a term for mindfulness with the
Enlightened One's special qualities as its object.



The recollection arisen inspired by the Law is the *recollection of the
Dhamma*.1 This is a term for mindfulness with the special qualities of
the Law's being well proclaimed, etc., as its object.



1\. The word *dhamma---*perhaps the most important and frequently used
of Pali words---has no single equivalent in English because no English
word has both a generalization so wide and loose as the word *dhamma* in
its widest sense (which includes "everything" that can be known or
thought of in any way) and at the same time an ability to be, as it
were, focused in a set of well-defined specific uses. Roughly *dhamma* =
what-can-be-remembered or what-can-be-borne-in-mind (*dhāretabba*) as\
*kamma* = what-can-be-done (*kātabba*). The following two principal (and
overlapping)\
senses are involved here: (i) the Law as taught, and (ii) objects of
consciousness. (i) In the first case the word has either been left
untranslated as "Dhamma" or "dhamma" or it has been tendered as "Law" or
"law." This ranges from the loose sense of the "Good Law," "cosmic law,"
and "teaching" to such specific technical senses as the "discrimination
of law," "causality," "being subject to or having the nature of." (ii)
In the second case the word in its looser sense of "something known or
thought of" has either been left untranslated as "dhamma" or rendered by
"state" (more rarely by "thing" or "phenomenon"), while in its technical
sense as one of the twelve bases or eighteen elements "mental object"
and "mental datum" have been used. The sometimes indiscriminate use of
"dhamma," "state" and "law" in both the looser senses is deliberate. The
English words have been reserved as far as possible for rendering
*dhamma* (except that "state" has sometimes been used to render *bhāva*,
etc., in the sense of "-ness"). Other subsidiary meanings of a
non-technical nature have occasionally been otherwise rendered according
to context.


[]



[]



The recollection arisen inspired by the Community is the *recollection
of the* *Saṅgha*. This is a term for mindfulness with the Community's
special qualities of being entered on the good way, etc., as its object.



The recollection arisen inspired by virtue is the *recollection of
virtue*. This is a term



for mindfulness with the special qualities of virtue's untornness, etc.,
as its object.



The recollection arisen inspired by generosity is the *recollection of
generosity*. This is a term for mindfulness with generosity's special
qualities of free generosity, etc., as its object.



The recollection arisen inspired by deities is the *recollection of
deities*. This is a term for mindfulness with the special qualities of
one's own faith, etc., as its object with deities standing as witnesses.



The recollection arisen inspired by death is the *recollection of
death*. This is a



term for mindfulness with the termination of the life faculty as its
object.



\[*Mindfulness occupied with the body (kāya-gatā sati---*lit. "body-gone
mindfulness"):\] it is gone (*gata*) to the material body (*kāya*) that
is analyzed into head hairs, etc., or it is gone into the body, thus it
is "body-gone" (*kāya-gatā*). It is body-gone (*kāya-gatā*) and it is
mindfulness (*sati*), thus it is "body-gone- mindfulness"
(*kāyagatasati---*single compound); but instead of shortening \[the
vowel\] thus in the usual way, "body-gone mindfulness" (*kāyagatā
sati---* compound adj. + noun) is said. This is a term for mindfulness
that has as its object the sign of the bodily parts consisting of head
hairs and the rest.



The mindfulness arisen inspired by breathing (*ānāpāna*) is *mindfulness
of* *breathing*. This is a term for mindfulness that has as its object
the sign of in- breaths and out-breaths.



In order to avoid muddle it is necessary to distinguish renderings of
the word *dhamma* and renderings of the words used to define it. The
word itself is a gerundive of the verb *dharati* (caus. *dhāreti---*"to
bear") and so is the literal equivalent of "\[quality\] that is to be
borne." But since the grammatical meanings of the two words *dharati*
("to bear") and *dahati* ("to put or sort out," whence
*dhātu---*"element") sometimes coalesce, it often comes very close to
*dhātu* (but see VIII n. 68 and XI.104). If it is asked, what bears the
qualities to be borne? A correct answer here would probably be that it
is the event (*samaya*), as stated in the Dhammasaṅgaṇī (§1, etc.), in
which the various dhammas listed there arise and are present, variously
related to each other. The word *dhammin* (thing qualified or "bearer of
what is to be borne") is a late introduction as a logical term (perhaps
first used in Pali by Vism-mhṭ, see p. 534). As to the definitions of
the word, there are several. At D-a I 99 four meanings are given: moral
(meritorious) special quality (*guṇa*), preaching of the Law (*desanā*),
scripture (*pariyatti*), and "no-living-being-ness" (*nissattatā*). Four
meanings are also given at Dhs-a 38: scripture (*pariyatti*), cause (of
effect) as law (*hetu*), moral (meritorious) special quality (*guṇa*),
and "no-living-being-ness and soullessness" (*nissatta-nijjīvatā*). A
wider definition is given at M-a I 17, where the following meanings are
distinguished: scriptural mastery, (*pariyatti---*A III 86) truth,
(*sacca---*Vin I 12) concentration, (*samādhi---* D II 54)
understanding, (*paññā---*J-a I 280) nature, (*pakati---*M I 162)
individual essence, (*sabhāva---*Dhs 1) voidness, (*suññatā---*Dhs 25)
merit, (*puñña---*S I 82) offence, (*āpatti---* Vin III 187) what is
knowable, (*ñeyya---*Paṭis II 194) "*and so on*" (see also VIII n. 68).

The recollection arisen inspired by peace is the *recollection of
peace*. This is a



term that has as its object the stilling of all suffering.



\[(1) RECOLLECTION OF THE ENLIGHTENED ONE\]



[2.]\[198\] Now, a meditator with absolute confidence2 who
wants to develop firstly the recollection of the Enlightened One among
these ten should go into solitary retreat in a favourable abode and
recollect the special qualities of the Enlightened One, the Blessed One,
as follows:



That Blessed One is such since he is accomplished, fully enlightened,
endowed with \[clear\] vision and \[virtuous\] conduct, sublime, the
knower of worlds, the incomparable leader of men to be tamed, the
teacher of gods and men, enlightened and blessed (M I 37; A III 285).



[3.]Here is the way he recollects: "That Blessed One is such
since he is accomplished, he is such since he is fully enlightened, ...
he is such since he is blessed"---he is so for these several reasons, is
what is meant.



\[ACCOMPLISHED\]



[4.]Herein, what he recollects firstly is that the Blessed One
is *accomplished* (*arahanta*) for the following reasons: (i) because of
remoteness (*āraka*), and (ii) because of his enemies (*ari*) and (iii)
the spokes (*ara*) having been destroyed (*hata*), and (iv) because of
his worthiness (*araha*) of requisites, etc., and (v) because of absence
of secret (*rahābhāva*) evil-doing.3



[5.](i) He stands utterly remote and far away from all
defilements because he has expunged all trace of defilement by means of
the path---because of such remoteness (*āraka*) he is accomplished
(*arahanta*).



A man remote (*āraka*) indeed we call\
From something he has not at all;\
The Saviour too that has no stain\
May well the name "accomplished" (*arahanta*) gain.



[6.](ii) And these enemies (*ari*), these defilements, are
destroyed (*hata*) by the path---because the enemies are thus destroyed
he is accomplished (*arahanta*) also.



The enemies (*ari*) that were deployed,\
Greed and the rest, have been destroyed (*hata*)\
By his, the Helper's, wisdom's sword,\
So he is "accomplished" (*arahanta*), all accord.



[7.](iii) Now, this wheel of the round of rebirths with its hub
made of ignorance and of craving for becoming, with its spokes
consisting of formations of merit and the rest, with its rim of ageing
and death, which is joined to the chariot of



2\. "'*Absolute confidence'* is the confidence afforded by the noble
path. Development of the recollection comes to success in him who has
that, not in any other" (Vism-mhṭ 181). "Absolute confidence" is a
constituent of the first three "factors of stream- entry" (see S V
196).\



3\. Cf. derivation of the word *ariya* ("noble") at M-a I 21.



[]



[]



the triple becoming by piercing it with the axle made of the origins of
cankers (see M I 55), has been revolving throughout time that has no
beginning. All of this wheel's spokes (*ara*) were destroyed (*hata*) by
him at the Place of Enlightenment, as he stood firm with the feet of
energy on the ground of virtue, wielding with the hand of faith the axe
of knowledge that destroys kamma--- because the spokes are thus
destroyed he is *accomplished*  (*arahanta*) also.



[8.]Or alternatively, it is the beginningless round of rebirths
that is called the "wheel of the round of rebirths." Ignorance is its
hub because it is its root. Ageing-and-death is its rim because it
terminates it. The remaining ten states \[of the dependent origination\]
are its spokes because ignorance is their root and ageing-and-death
their termination.



[9.]Herein, ignorance is unknowing about suffering and the
rest. And ignorance in sensual becoming \[199\] is a condition for
formations in sensual becoming. Ignorance in fine-material becoming is a
condition for formations in fine-material becoming. Ignorance in
immaterial becoming is a condition for formations in immaterial
becoming.



[10.] Formations in sensual becoming are a condition for
rebirth-linking



consciousness in sensual becoming. And similarly with the rest.



[11.] Rebirth-linking consciousness in sensual becoming is a
condition for mentality-materiality in sensual becoming. Similarly in
fine-material becoming. In immaterial becoming it is a condition for
mentality only.



[12.] Mentality-materiality in sensual becoming is a condition
for the sixfold base in sensual becoming. Mentality-materiality in
fine-material becoming is a condition for three bases in fine-material
becoming. Mentality in immaterial becoming is a condition for one base
in immaterial becoming.



[13.]The sixfold base in sensual becoming is a condition for
six kinds of contact in sensual becoming. Three bases in fine-material
becoming are conditions for three kinds of contact in fine-material
becoming. The mind base alone in immaterial becoming is a condition for
one kind of contact in immaterial becoming.



[14.]The six kinds of contact in sensual becoming are
conditions for six kinds of feeling in sensual becoming. Three kinds of
contact in fine-material becoming are conditions for three kinds of
feeling there too. One kind of contact in immaterial becoming is a
condition for one kind of feeling there too.



[15.] The six kinds of feeling in sensual becoming are
conditions for the six groups of craving in sensual becoming. Three in
the fine-material becoming are for three there too. One kind of feeling
in the immaterial becoming is a condition for one group of craving in
the immaterial becoming. The craving in the several kinds of becoming is
a condition for the clinging there.



[16.]Clinging, etc., are the respective conditions for becoming
and the rest. In what way? Here someone thinks, "I shall enjoy sense
desires," and with sense- desire clinging as condition he misconducts
himself in body, speech, and mind. Owing to the fulfilment of his
misconduct he reappears in a state of loss (deprivation). The kamma that
is the cause of his reappearance there is kamma-



[]



[]



process becoming, the aggregates generated by the kamma are
rebirth-process becoming, the generating of the aggregates is birth,
their maturing is ageing, their dissolution is death.



[17.]Another thinks, "I shall enjoy the delights of heaven,"
and in the parallel manner he conducts himself well. Owing to the
fulfilment of his good conduct he reappears in a \[sensual-sphere\]
heaven. The kamma that is the cause of his reappearance there is
kamma-process becoming, and the rest as before.



[18.]Another thinks, "I shall enjoy the delights of the
Brahmā-world," and with sense-desire clinging as condition he develops
loving-kindness, compassion, gladness, and equanimity.4 \[200\] Owing to
the fulfilment of the meditative development he is reborn in the
Brahmā-world. The kamma that is the cause of his rebirth there is
kamma-process becoming, and the rest is as before.



[19.] Yet another thinks, "I shall enjoy the delights of
immaterial becoming," and with the same condition he develops the
attainments beginning with the base consisting of boundless space. Owing
to the fulfilment of the development he is reborn in one of these
states. The kamma that is the cause of his rebirth there is
kamma-process becoming, the aggregates generated by the kamma are
rebirth- process becoming, the generating of the aggregates is birth,
their maturing is ageing, their dissolution is death (see M II 263). The
remaining kinds of clinging are construable in the same way.



[20.] So, "Understanding of discernment of conditions thus,
'Ignorance is a cause, formations are causally arisen, and both these
states are causally arisen,' is knowledge of the causal relationship of
states. Understanding of discernment of conditions thus, 'In the past
and in the future ignorance is a cause, formations are causally arisen,
and both these states are causally arisen,' is knowledge of the causal
relationship of states" (Paṭis I 50), and all the clauses should be
given in detail in this way.



[21.] Herein, ignorance and formations are one summarization;
consciousness, mentality-materiality, the sixfold base, contact, and
feeling are another; craving, clinging, and becoming are another; and
birth and ageing-and-death are another. Here the first summarization is
past, the two middle ones are present, and birth and ageing-and-death
are future. When ignorance and formations are mentioned, thentates,
became dispassionate towards them, when his greed faded away, when he
was liberated, then he destroyed, quite destroyed, abolished, the spokes
of this wheel of the round of rebirths of the kind just described.



[22.]Now, the Blessed One knew, saw, understood, and penetrated
in all aspects this dependent origination with its four summarizations,
its three times, its twenty aspects, and its three links. "Knowledge is
in the sense of that being known,5 and understanding is in the sense of
the act of understanding that.



4\. "Because of the words, 'Also all dhammas of the three planes are
sense desires (*kāma*) in the sense of being desirable (*kamanīya*) (Cf.
Nidd I 1: *sabbepi kāmāvacarā dhammā, sabbepi rūpāvacarā dhammā, sabbepi
arūpāvacarā dhammā ... kāmanīyaṭṭhena ... kāmā*), greed for becoming is
sense-desire clinging' (Vism-mhṭ 184).  See XII.72. For the "way to the
Brahmā-world" see M II 194--96; 207f.



[]



[]



Hence it was said: 'Understanding of discernment of conditions is
knowledge of the causal relationship of states'" (Paṭis I 52). Thus when
the Blessed One, by correctly knowing these states with knowledge of
relations of states, became dispassionate towards them, when his greed
faded away, when he was liberated, then he destroyed, quite destroyed,
abolished, the spokes of this wheel of the round of rebirths of the kind
just described.



Because the spokes are thus destroyed he is accomplished (*arahanta*)
also.



\[201\]



The spokes (*ara*) of rebirth's wheel have been\
Destroyed (*hata*) with wisdom's weapon keen\
By him, the Helper of the World,\
And so "accomplished" (*arahanta*) he is called.



[23.] (iv) And he is worthy (*arahati*) of the requisites of
robes, etc., and of the distinction of being accorded homage because it
is he who is most worthy of offerings. For when a Perfect One has
arisen, important deities and human beings pay homage to none else; for
Brahmā Sahampati paid homage to the Perfect One with a jewelled garland
as big as Sineru, and other deities did so according to their means, as
well as human beings as King Bimbisāra \[of Magadha\] and the king of
Kosala. And after the Blessed One had finally attained Nibbāna, King
Asoka renounced wealth to the amount of ninety-six million for his sake
and founded eight-four thousand monasteries throughout all Jambudīpa
(India). And so, with all these, what need to speak of others? Because
of worthiness of requisites he is accomplished (*arahanta*) also.



So he is worthy, the Helper of the World,\
Of homage paid with requisites; the word\
"Accomplished" (*arahanta*) has this meaning in the world: Hence the
Victor is worthy of that word.



[24.] (v) And he does not act like those fools in the world who
vaunt their cleverness and yet do evil, but in secret for fear of
getting a bad name. Because of absence of secret (*rahābhāva*)
evil-doing he is accomplished (*arahanta*) also.



No secret evil deed may claim\
An author so august; the name\
"Accomplished" (*arahanta*) is his deservedly\
By absence of such secrecy (*rahābhāva*).



[25.]So in all ways:



The Sage of remoteness unalloyed,\
Vanquished defiling foes deployed,\
The spokes of rebirth's wheel destroyed,\
Worthy of requisites employed,\
Secret evil he does avoid:\
For these five reasons he may claim\
This word "accomplished" for his name.



5\. Reading "*taṃ ñātaṭṭthena ñāṇaṃ"* with Vism-mhṭ.



[]



[]



\[FULLY  ENLIGHTENED\]



[26.] He is fully enlightened (*sammāsambuddha*) because he has
discovered



(*buddha*) all things rightly (*sammā*) and by himself (*sāmaṃ*).



In fact, all things were discovered by him rightly by himself in that he
discovered, of the things to be directly known, that they must be
directly known (that is, learning about the four truths), of the things
to be fully understood that they must be fully understood (that is,
penetration of suffering), of the things to be abandoned that they must
be abandoned (that is, penetration of the origin of suffering), of the
things to be realized that they must be realized (that is, penetration
of the cessation of suffering), and of the things to be developed that
they must be developed (that is, penetration of the path). Hence it is
said:



What must be directly known is directly known,\
What has to be developed has been developed,\
What has to be abandoned has been abandoned;\
And that, brahman, is why I am enlightened (Sn 558).



[27.]\[202\] Besides, he has discovered all things rightly by
himself step by step thus: The eye is the truth of suffering; the prior
craving that originates it by being its root-cause is the truth of
origin; the non-occurrence of both is the truth of cessation; the way
that is the act of understanding cessation is the truth of the path. And
so too in the case of the ear, the nose, the tongue, the body, and the
mind.



[28.]And the following things should be construed in the same
way:



the six bases beginning with visible objects;



the six groups of consciousness beginning with eye-consciousness;



the six kinds of contact beginning with eye-contact;



the six kinds of feeling beginning with the eye-contact-born;



the six kinds of perception beginning with perception of visible
objects;



the six kinds of volition beginning with volition about visible objects;



the six groups of craving beginning with craving for visible objects;



the six kinds of applied thought beginning with applied thought about
visible



objects;



the six kinds of sustained thought beginning with sustained thought
about



visible objects;



the five aggregates beginning with the aggregate of matter;



the ten kasiṇas;



the ten recollections;



the ten perceptions beginning with perception of the bloated;



the thirty-two aspects \[of the body\] beginning with head hairs;



the twelve bases;



the eighteen elements;



the nine kinds of becoming beginning with sensual becoming;6



[]



[]



the four jhānas beginning with the first;



the four measureless states beginning with the development of loving-



kindness;



the four immaterial attainments;



the factors of the dependent origination in reverse order beginning with



ageing-and-death and in forward order beginning with ignorance (cf.
XX.9).



[29.] Herein, this is the construction of a single clause \[of
the dependent origination\]: Ageing-and-death is the truth of suffering,
birth is the truth of origin, the escape from both is the truth of
cessation, the way that is the act of understanding cessation is the
truth of the path.



In this way he has discovered, progressively discovered, completely
discovered, all states rightly and by himself step by step. Hence it was
said above: "He is fully enlightened because he has discovered all
things rightly and by himself" (§26).7



\[ENDOWED WITH CLEAR VISION AND VIRTUOUS CONDUCT\]



[30.]He is endowed with \[clear\] vision and \[virtuous\]
conduct: *vijjācaraṇasampanno = vijjāhi caraṇena ca sampanno*
(resolution of compound).



6\. See XVII.253f. The word *bhava* is rendered here both by "existence"
and by "becoming." The former, while less awkward to the ear, is
inaccurate if it is allowed a flavour of staticness. "Becoming" will be
more frequently used as this work proceeds. Loosely the two senses tend
to merge. But technically, "existence" should perhaps be used only for
*atthitā*, which signifies the momentary existence of a *dhamma*
"possessed of the three instants of arising, presence, and dissolution."
"Becoming" then signifies the continuous flow or flux of such
triple-instant moments; and it occurs in three main modes: sensual,
fine-material, and immaterial. For remarks on the words "being" and
"essence" see VIII n. 68.\



7\. "Is not unobstructed knowledge (*anāvaraṇa-ñāṇa*) different from
omniscient knowledge (*sabbaññuta-ñāṇa*)? Otherwise the words "Six kinds
of knowledge unshared \[by disciples\]" (Paṭis I 3) would be
contradicted? \[Note: The six kinds are: knowledge of what faculties
prevail in beings, knowledge of the inclinations and tendencies of
beings, knowledge of the Twin Marvel, knowledge of the attainment of the
great compassion, omniscient knowledge, and unobstructed knowledge (see
Paṭis I 133)\].--- There is no contradiction, because two ways in which
a single kind of knowledge's objective field occurs are described for
the purpose of showing by means of this difference how it is not shared
by others.\
It is only one kind of knowledge; but it is called omniscient knowledge
because its objective field consists of formed, unformed, and
conventional (*sammuti*) \[i.e. conceptual\] dhammas without remainder,
and it is called unobstructed knowledge because of its unrestricted
access to the objective field, because of absence of obstruction. And it
is said accordingly in the Paṭisambhidā: "It knows all the formed and
the unformed without remainder, thus it is omniscient knowledge. It has
no obstruction therein, thus it is unobstructed knowledge" (Paṭis I
131), and so on. So they are not different kinds of knowledge. And there
must be no reservation, otherwise it would follow that omniscient and
unobstructed knowledge had obstructions and did not make all dhammas its
object. There is not in fact a minimal obstruction to the



[]



[]



Blessed One's knowledge: and if his unobstructed knowledge did not have
all dhammas as its object, there would be presence of obstruction where
it did not occur, and so it would not be unobstructed.\
"Or alternatively, even if we suppose that they are different, still it
is omniscient knowledge itself that is intended as 'unhindered' since it
is that which occurs unhindered universally. And it is by his attainment
of that that the Blessed One is known as Omniscient, All-seer, Fully
Enlightened, not because of awareness (*avabodha*) of every dhamma at
once, simultaneously (see M II 127). And it is said accordingly in the
Paṭisambhidā: 'This is a name derived from the final liberation of the
Enlightened Ones, the Blessed Ones, together with the acquisition of
omniscient knowledge at the root of the Enlightenment Tree; this name
"Buddha" is a designation based on realization' (Paṭis I 174). For the
ability in the Blessed One's continuity to penetrate all dhammas without
exception was due to his having completely attained to knowledge capable
of becoming aware of all dhammas.\
"Here it may be asked: But how then? When this knowledge occurs, does it
do so with respect to every field simultaneously, or successively? For
firstly, if it occurs simultaneously with respect to every objective
field, then with the simultaneous appearance of formed dhammas classed
as past, future and present, internal and external, etc., and of
unformed and conventional (conceptual) dhammas, there would be no
awareness of contrast (*paṭibhāga*), as happens in one who looks at a
painted canvas from a distance. That being so, it follows that all
dhammas become the objective field of the Blessed One's knowledge in an
undifferentiated form (*anirūpita-rūpana*), as they do through the
aspect of not-self to those who are exercising insight thus 'All dhammas
are not-self' (Dhp 279; Th 678; M I 230; II 64; S III 132; A I 286; IV
14; Paṭis II 48, 62; Vin I 86. Cf. also A III 444; IV 88, 338; Sn 1076).
And those do not escape this difficulty who say that the Enlightened
One's knowledge occurs with the characteristic of presence of all
knowable dhammas as its objective field, devoid of discriminative
thinking (*vikappa-rahita*), and universal in time (*sabba-kāla*) and
that is why they are called 'All-seeing' and why it is said, 'The Nāga
is concentrated walking and he is concentrated standing' (?).\
They do not escape the difficulty since the Blessed One's knowledge
would then have only a partial objective field, because, by having the
characteristic of presence as its object, past, future and conventional
dhammas, which lack that characteristic, would be absent. So it is wrong
to say that it occurs simultaneously with respect to every objective
field. Then secondly, if we say that it occurs successively with respect
to every objective field, that is wrong too. For when the knowable,
classed in the many different ways according to birth, place, individual
essence, etc., and direction, place, time, etc., is apprehended
successively, then penetration without remainder is not effected since
the knowable is infinite. And those are wrong too who say that the
Blessed One is All-seeing owing to his doing his defining by taking one
part of the knowable as that actually experienced (*paccakkha*) and
deciding that the rest is the same because of the unequivocalness of its
meaning, and that such knowledge is not



Herein, as to \[*clear*\] *vision*: there are three kinds of clear
vision and eight kinds of clear vision. The three kinds should be
understood as stated in the Bhayabherava Sutta (M I 22f.), and the eight
kinds as stated in the Ambaṭṭha Sutta (D I 100). For there eight kinds
of clear vision are stated, made up of the six kinds of direct-knowledge
together with insight and the supernormal power of the mind-made
\[body\].



[]



[]



inferential (*anumānika*) since it is free from doubt, because it is
what is doubtfully discovered that is meant by inferential knowledge in
the world. And they are wrong because there is no such defining by
taking one part of the knowable as that actually experienced and
deciding that the rest is the same because of the unequivocalness of its
meaning, without making all of it actually experienced. For then that
'rest' is not actually experienced; and if it were actually experienced,
it would no longer be 'the rest.' "All that is no argument.---Why
not?---Because this is not a field for ratiocination; for the Blessed
One has said this: 'The objective field of Enlightened Ones is
unthinkable, it cannot be thought out; anyone who tried to think it out
would reap madness and frustration' (A II 80). The agreed explanation
here is this: Whatever the Blessed One wants to know---either entirely
or partially---there his knowledge occurs as actual experience because
it does so without hindrance. And it has constant concentration because
of the absence of distraction. And it cannot occur in association with
wishing of a kind that is due to absence from the objective field of
something that he wants to know. There can be no exception to this
because of the words, 'All dhammas are  available to the adverting of
the Enlightened One, the Blessed  One, are available at his wish, are
available to his attention, are available to his thought' (Paṭis II
195). And the Blessed One's knowledge that has the past and future as
its objective field is entirely actual experience since it is devoid of
assumption based on inference, tradition or conjecture.\
"And yet, even in that case, suppose he wanted to know the whole in its
entirety, then would his knowledge not occur without differentiation in
the whole objective field simultaneously? And so there would still be no
getting out of that difficulty? "That is not so, because of its
purifiedness. Because the Enlightened One's objective field is purified
and it is unthinkable. Otherwise there would be no unthinkableness in
the knowledge of the Enlightened One, the Blessed One, if it occurred in
the same way as that of ordinary people. So, although it occurs with all
dhammas as its object, it nevertheless does so making those dhammas
quite clearly defined, as though it had a single dhamma as its object.
This is what is unthinkable here. ' There is as much knowledge as there
is knowable, there is as much knowable as there is knowledge; the
knowledge is limited by the knowable, the knowable is limited by the
knowledge' (Paṭis II l95). So he is Fully Enlightened because he has
rightly and by himself discovered all dhammas together and separately,
simultaneously and successively, according to his wish' (Vism-mhṭ
190--91).\



8\. A possessor of "the seven" has faith, conscience, shame, learning,
energy, mindfulness, and understanding (see D III 252). PED traces
*saddhamma* (as "the true dhamma," etc.) to *sant* + *dhamma*; but it is
as likely traceable to *srad* + *dhamma* = (good\
ground) for the placing of faith (*saddhā*).



[31.] \[*Virtuous*\]  *conduct* should be understood as fifteen
things, that is to say: restraint by virtue, guarding of the sense
faculties, knowledge of the right amount in eating, devotion to
wakefulness, the seven good states,8 and the four jhānas of the
fine-material sphere. For it is precisely by means of these fifteen
things that a noble disciple conducts himself, that he goes towards the
deathless. That is why it is called "\[*virtuous*\]  *conduct*,"
according as it is said, "Here, Mahānāma, a noble disciple has virtue"
(M I 355), etc, the whole of which should be understood as given in the
Middle Fifty \[of the Majjhima Nikāya\].



[]



[]



\[203\] Now, the Blessed One is endowed with these kinds of clear vision
and with this conduct as well; hence he is called "endowed with
\[clear\] vision and \[*virtuous*\]  *conduct*."



[32.] Herein, the Blessed One's possession of clear vision
consists in the fulfilment of omniscience (Paṭis I 131), while his
possession of conduct consists in the fulfilment of the great compassion
(Paṭis I 126). He knows through omniscience what is good and harmful for
all beings, and through compassion he warns them of harm and exhorts
them to do good. That is how he is possessed of clear vision and
conduct, which is why his disciples have entered upon the good way
instead of entering upon the bad way as the self-mortifying disciples of
those who are not possessed of clear vision and conduct have done.9



\[SUBLIME\]



[33.]He is called *sublime* (*sugata*)10 (i) because of a
manner of going that is good (*sobhaṇa-gamana*), (ii) because of being
gone to an excellent place (*sundaraṃ*



9\. "Here the Master's possession of vision shows the greatness of
understanding, and his possession of conduct the greatness of his
compassion. It was through understanding that the Blessed One reached
the kingdom of the Dhamma, and through compassion that he became the
bestower of the Dhamma. It was through understanding that he felt
revulsion for the round of rebirths, and through compassion that he bore
it. It was through understanding that he fully understood others'
suffering, and through compassion that he undertook to counteract it. It
was through understanding that he was brought face to face with Nibbāna,
and through compassion that he attained it. It was through understanding
that he himself crossed over, and through compassion that he brought
others across. It was through understanding that he perfected the
Enlightened One's state, and through compassion that he perfected the
Enlightened One's task.\
"Or it was through compassion that he faced the round of rebirths as a
Bodhisatta, and through understanding that he took no delight in it.
Likewise it was through compassion that he practiced non-cruelty to
others, and through understanding that he was himself fearless of
others. It was through compassion that he protected others to protect
himself, and through understanding that he protected himself to protect
others. Likewise it was through compassion that he did not torment
others, and through understanding that he did not torment himself; so of
the four types of persons beginning with the one who practices for his
own welfare (A II 96) he perfected the fourth and best type. Likewise it
was through compassion that he became the world's helper, and through
understanding that he became his own helper. It was through compassion
that he had humility \[as a Bodhisatta\], and through understanding that
he had dignity \[as a Buddha\]. Likewise it was through compassion that
he helped all beings as a father while owing to the understanding
associated with it his mind remained detached from them all, and it was
through understanding that his mind remained detached from all dhammas
while owing to the compassion associated with it that he was helpful to
all beings. For just as the Blessed One's compassion was devoid of
sentimental affection or sorrow, so his understanding was free from the
thoughts of 'I' and 'mine'" (Vism-mhṭ 192--93).\

*ṭhānaṃ gatattā*), (iii) because of having gone rightly
(*sammāgatattā*), and (iv) because of enunciating rightly
(*sammāgadattā*).



[(i)] A manner of going (*gamana*) is called "gone" (*gata*),
and that in the Blessed One is good (*sobhaṇa*), purified, blameless.
But what is that? It is the noble path; for by means of that manner of
going he has "gone" without attachment in the direction of safety---thus
he is sublime (*sugata*) because of a manner of going that is good.



[(ii)] And it is to the excellent (*sundara*) place that he has
gone (*gata*), to the deathless Nibbāna---thus he is sublime (*sugata*)
also because of having gone to an excellent place.



[34.](iii) And he has rightly (*sammā*) gone (*gata*), without
going back again to the defilements abandoned by each path. For this is
said: "He does not again turn, return, go back, to the defilements
abandoned by the stream entry path, thus he is sublime ... he does not
again turn, return, go back, to the defilements abandoned by the Arahant
path, thus he is sublime" (old commentary?). Or alternatively, he has
rightly gone from the time of \[making his resolution\] at the feet of
Dīpaṅkara up till the Enlightenment Session, by working for the welfare
and happiness of the whole world through the fulfilment of the thirty
perfections and through following the right way without deviating
towards either of the two extremes, that is to say, towards eternalism
or annihilationism, towards indulgence in sense pleasures or
self-mortification---thus he is sublime also because of having gone
rightly.



[35.] (iv) And he enunciates11  (*gadati*) rightly (*sammā*);
he speaks only fitting speech in the fitting place---thus he is sublime
also because of enunciating rightly.



Here is a sutta that confirms this: "Such speech as the Perfect One
knows to be untrue and incorrect, conducive to harm, and displeasing and
unwelcome to others, that he does not speak. And such speech as the
Perfect One knows to be true and correct, but conducive to harm, and
displeasing and unwelcome to others, that he does not speak. \[204\] And
such speech as the Perfect One knows to be true and correct, conducive
to good, but displeasing and unwelcome to others, that speech the
Perfect One knows the time to expound. Such speech as the Perfect One
knows to be untrue and incorrect, and conducive to harm, but pleasing
and welcome to others, that he does not speak. And such speech as the
Perfect One knows to be true and correct, but conducive to harm, though
pleasing and welcome to others, that he does not speak. And such speech
as the Perfect One knows to be true and correct, conducive to good, and
pleasing and welcome to others, that speech the Perfect One knows the
time to expound" (M I 395)--- thus he is sublime also because of
enunciating rightly.

\[KNOWER OF WORLDS\]



[36.]He is the *knower of worlds* because he has known the
world in all ways. For the Blessed One has experienced, known and
penetrated the world in all ways to its individual essence, its arising,
its cessation, and the means to its cessation, according as it is said:
"Friend, that there is a world's end where one neither is born nor ages
nor dies nor passes away nor reappears, which is to be known or seen or
reached by travel---that I do not say. Yet I do not say that there is
ending of suffering without reaching the world's end. Rather, it is in
this fathom-long carcass with its perceptions and its consciousness that
I make known the world, the arising of the world, the cessation of the
world, and the way leading to the cessation of the world.



"Tis utterly impossible\
To reach by travel the world's end;\
But there is no escape from pain\
Until the world's end has been reached.\
It is a sage, a knower of the worlds,\
Who gets to the world's end, and it is he\
Whose life divine is lived out to its term;\
He is at peace who the world's end has known\
And hopes for neither this world nor the next" (S I 62).



[37.]Moreover, there are three worlds: the world of formations,
the world of beings, and the world of location. Herein, in the passage,
"One world: all beings subsist by nutriment" (Paṭis I 122), \[205\] the
world of formations is to be understood. In the passage, "'The world is
eternal' or 'The world is not eternal'" (M I 426) it is the world of
beings. In the passage:



"As far as moon and sun do circulate\
Shining12 and lighting up the \[four\] directions,\
Over a thousand times as great a world\
Your power holds unquestionable sway" (M I 328)---



it is the world of location. The Blessed One has known that in all ways
too.



[38.]Likewise, because of the words: "One world: all beings
subsist by nutriment. Two worlds: mentality and materiality. Three
worlds: three kinds of feeling. Four worlds: four kinds of nutriment.
Five worlds: five aggregates as objects of clinging. Six worlds: six
internal bases. Seven worlds: seven stations of consciousness. Eight
worlds: eight worldly states. Nine worlds: nine abodes of beings. Ten
worlds: ten bases. Twelve worlds: twelve bases. Eighteen worlds:
eighteen elements" (Paṭis I 122),13 this world of formations was known
to him in all ways.



[39.] But he knows all beings' habits, knows their inherent
tendencies, knows their temperaments, knows their bents, knows them as
with little dust on their eyes and with much dust on their eyes, with
keen faculties and with dull faculties, with good behaviour and with bad
behaviour, easy to teach and hard to teach,

13\. To take what is not self-evident in this paragraph, *three kinds of
feeling* are pleasant, painful and neither-painful-nor-pleasant (see MN
59). *Four kinds of nutriment* are physical

nutriment, contact, mental volition, and consciousness (see M I 48, and
M-a I 207f.). *The seven stations of consciousness* are: (1) sense
sphere, (2) Brahmā's Retinue, (3) Ābhassara (Brahmā-world) Deities, (4)
Subhakiṇṇa (Brahmā-world) Deities, (5) base consisting of boundless
space, (6) base consisting of boundless consciousness, (7) base
consisting of nothingness (see D III 253). *The eight worldly states*
are gain, fame, praise, pleasure, and their opposites (see D III 260).
*The nine abodes of beings*: (1--4) as in stations of consciousness, (5)
unconscious beings, (6--9) the four immaterial states (see D III 263).
*The ten bases* are eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, visible object, sound,
odour, flavour, tangible object.\



14\. *Cakkavāḷa* (world-sphere or universe) is a term for the concept of
a single complete universe as one of an infinite number of such
universes. This concept of the cosmos, in its general form, is not
peculiar to Buddhism, but appears to have been the already generally
accepted one. The term *loka-dhātu* (world-element), in its most
restricted sense, is one world-sphere, but it can be extended to mean
any number, for example, the set of world-spheres dominated by a
particular Brahmā (see MN 120). As thus conceived, a circle of
"world-sphere mountains" "like the rim of a wheel" (*cakka---*Vism-mhṭ
198) encloses the ocean. In the centre of the ocean stands Mount Sineru
(or Meru), surrounded by seven concentric rings of mountains separated
by rings of sea. In the ocean between the outermost of these seven rings
and the enclosing "world-sphere mountain" ring are the "four
continents."\
"Over forty-two thousand leagues away" (Dhs-a 313) the moon and the sun
circulate above them inside the world-sphere mountain ring, and night is
the effect of the sun's going behind Sineru. The orbits of the moon and
sun are in the sense-sphere heaven of the Four Kings (*Catumahārājā*),
the lowest heaven, which is a layer extending from the world-sphere
mountains to the slopes of Sineru. The stars are on both sides of them
(Dhs-a 318). Above that come the successive layers of the other five
sense- sphere heavens---the four highest not touching the earth---and
above them the fine-material Brahmā-worlds, the higher of which extend
over more than one world- sphere (see A V 59). The world-sphere rests on
water, which rests on air, which rests on space. World-spheres "lie
adjacent to each other in contact like bowls, leaving a triangular unlit
space between each three" (Vism-mhṭ 199), called a "world-interspace"
(see too M-a IV 178). Their numbers extend thus in all four directions
to infinity on the supporting water's surface.\
The southern continent of Jambudīpa is the known inhabited world (but
see e.g. DN 26). Various hells (see e.g. MN 130; A V 173; Vin III 107)
are below the earth's surface. The lowest sensual-sphere heaven is that
of the Deities of the Four Kings



capable and incapable \[of achievement\] (cf. Paṭis I 121), therefore
this world of beings was known to him in all ways.



[40.]And as the world of beings so also the world of location.
For accordingly this \[world measures as follows\]:



One world-sphere14 is twelve hundred thousand leagues and thirty-four
hundred and fifty leagues (1,203,450) in breadth and width. In
circumference, however:



\[The measure of it\] all around\
Is six and thirty hundred thousand\
And then ten thousand in addition,\
Four hundred too less half a hundred (3,610,350).



[]



[]



[41.] Herein:



Two times a hundred thousand leagues\
And then four *nahutas* as well (240,000):\
This earth, this "Bearer of All Wealth,"\
Has that much thickness, as they tell.



And its support:



Four times a hundred thousand leagues\
And then eight *nahutas* as well (480,000):\
The water resting on the air\
Has that much thickness, as they tell.



And the support of that: \[206\]



Nine times a hundred thousand goes\
The air out in the firmament\
And sixty thousand more besides (960,000)\
So this much is the world's extent.



[42.]Such is its extent. And these features are to be found in
it:



Sineru, tallest of all mountains, plunges down into the sea\
Full four and eighty thousand leagues, and towers up in like degree
Seven concentric mountain rings surround Sineru in suchwise That each of
them in depth and height is half its predecessor's size: Vast ranges
called Yugandhara, Ìsadhara, Karavīka,\
Sudassana, Nemindhara, Vinataka, Assakaṇṇa.\
Heavenly \[breezes fan\] their cliffs agleam with gems, and here reside
The Four Kings of the Cardinal Points, and other gods and sprites
beside.15 Himālaya's lofty mountain mass rises in height five hundred
leagues And in its width and in its breadth it covers quite three
thousand leagues, And then it is bedecked besides with four and eighty
thousand peaks.16



(*Cātumahārājika*). The four are Dhataraṭṭha Gandhabba-rāja (King of the
East), Virūḷha Kumbhaṇḍa-rāja (King of the South), Virūpaka Nāga-rāja
(King of the West), and Kuvera or Vessavaṇa Yakkha-rāja (King of the
North---see DN 32). Here the moon and sun circulate. The deities of this
heaven are often at war with the Asura demons (see e.g. D II 285) for
possession of the lower slopes of Sineru. The next higher is Tāvatiṃsa
(the Heaven of the Thirty-three), governed by Sakka, Ruler of Gods
(*sakka- devinda*). Above this is the heaven of the Yāma Deities
(Deities who have Gone to Bliss) ruled by King Suyāma (not to be
confused with Yama King of the Underworld---see M III 179). Higher still
come the Deities of the Tusita (Contented) Heaven with King Santusita.
The fifth of these heavens is that of the Nimmānarati Deities (Deities
who Delight in Creating) ruled by King Sunimmita. The last and highest
of the sensual- sphere heavens is the Paranimmitavasavatti Heaven
(Deities who Wield Power over Others' Creations). Their king is
Vasavatti (see A I 227; for details see Vibh-a 519f.). Māra (Death)
lives in a remote part of this heaven with his hosts, like a rebel with
a band of brigands (M-a I 33f.). For destruction and renewal of all this
at the end of the aeon, see Ch. XIII.\

into the sea Just two and eighty thousand leagues, and towers up in like

And the size of the Jambu (Rose-apple) Tree is the same as that of the
Citrapāṭaliya Tree of the Asura demons, the Simbali Tree of the Garuḷa
demons, the Kadamba Tree in \[the western continent of\] Aparagoyana,
the Kappa Tree \[in the northern continent\] of the Uttarakurus, the
Sirīsa Tree in \[the eastern continent of\] Pubbavideha, and the
Pāricchattaka Tree \[in the heaven\] of the Deities of the Thirty-three
(Tāvatiṃsa).17 Hence the Ancients said:



The Pāṭali, Simbali, and Jambu, the deities' Pāricchattaka,\
The Kadamba, the Kappa Tree and the Sirīsa as the seventh.



[44.]\[207\] Herein, the moon's disk is forty-nine leagues
\[across\] and the sun's disk is fifty leagues. The realm of Tāvatiṃsa
(the Thirty-three Gods) is ten thousand leagues. Likewise the realm of
the Asura demons, the great Avīci (unremitting) Hell, and Jambudīpa
(India). Aparagoyāna is seven thousand leagues. Likewise Pubbavideha.
Uttarakurū is eight thousand leagues. And herein, each great continent
is surrounded by five hundred small islands. And the whole of that
constitutes a single world-sphere, a single world-element. Between
\[this and the adjacent world-spheres\] are the Lokantarika (world-
interspace) hells.18 So the world-spheres are infinite in number, the
world- elements are infinite, and the Blessed One has experienced, known
and penetrated them with the infinite knowledge of the Enlightened Ones.

ways too. So he is "knower of worlds" because he has seen the world in
all ways.



leagues in width and it is eighty-four thousand leagues in breadth' (A
IV 100). Each of the seven surrounding mountains is half as high as that
last mentioned, that is, Yugandhara is half as high as Sineru, and so
on. The great ocean gradually slopes from the foot of the world-sphere
mountains down as far as the foot of Sineru, where it measures in depth
as much as Sineru's height. And Yugandhara, which is half that height,
rests on the earth as Ìsadhara and the rest do; for it is said:
'Bhikkhus, the great ocean gradually slopes, gradually tends, gradually
inclines' (Ud 53). Between Sineru and Yugandhara and so on, the oceans
are called 'bottomless' (*sīdanta*). Their widths correspond
respectively to the heights of Sineru and the rest. The mountains stand
all round Sineru, enclosing it, as it were. Yugandhara surrounds Sineru,
then Ìsadhara surrounds Yugandhara, and likewise with the others"
(Vism-mhṭ 199).

\[INCOMPARABLE LEADER OF MEN TO BE TAMED\]



[46.] In the absence of anyone more distinguished for special
qualities than himself, there is no one to compare with him, thus he is
*incomparable*. For in this way he surpasses the whole world in the
special quality of virtue, and also in the special qualities of
concentration, understanding, deliverance, and knowledge and vision of
deliverance. In the special quality of virtue he is without equal, he is
the equal only of those \[other Enlightened Ones\] without equal, he is
without like, without double, without counterpart; ... in the special
quality of knowledge and vision of deliverance he is ... without
counterpart, according as it is said: "I do not see in the world with
its deities, its Māras and its Brahmās, in this generation with its
ascetics and brahmans, with its princes and men,19 anyone more perfect
in virtue than myself" (S I 139), with the rest in detail, and likewise
in the Aggappasāda Sutta (A II 34; It 87), and so on, and in the stanzas
beginning, "I have no teacher and my like does not exist in all the
world" (M I 171), all of which should be taken in detail.



[47.] He guides (*sāreti*) men to be tamed (*purisa-damme*),
thus he is *leader of* *men to be tamed*  (*purisadammasārathī*); he
tames, he disciplines, is what is meant. Herein, animal males (*purisā*)
and human males, and non-human males that are not tamed but fit to be
tamed (*dametuṃ yuttā*) are "men to be tamed" (*purisadammā*). For the
animal males, namely, the royal nāga (serpent) Apalāla, Cūḷodara,
Mahodara, Aggisikha, Dhūmasikha, the royal nāga Āravāḷa, the elephant
Dhanapālaka, and so on, were tamed by the Blessed One, freed from the
poison \[of defilement\] and established in the refuges and the precepts
of virtue; and also the human males, namely, Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhas'
(Jains') son, the brahman student Ambaṭṭha, \[208\] Pokkharasāti,
Soṇadaṇḍa, Kūṭadanta, and so on; and also the non-human males, namely,
the spirits Āḷavaka, Sūciloma and Kharaloma, Sakka Ruler of Gods,
etc.,20 were tamed and disciplined by various disciplinary means. And
the following sutta should be given in full here: "I discipline men to
be tamed sometimes gently, Kesi, and I discipline them sometimes
roughly, and I discipline them sometimes gently and roughly" (A II 112).



[48.]Then the Blessed One moreover further tames those already
tamed, doing so by announcing the first jhāna, etc., respectively to
those whose virtue is purified, etc., and also the way to the higher
path to stream enterers, and so on.



19\. The rendering of *sadevamanussānaṃ* by "with its princes and men"
is supported by the commentary. See M-a II 20 and also M-a I 33 where
the use of *sammuti-deva* for a royal personage, not an actual god is
explained. *Deva* is the normal mode of addressing a king. Besides, the
first half of the sentence deals with deities and it would be out of
place to refer to them again in the clause related to mankind.



20\. The references are these: Apalāla (*Mahāvaṃsa*, p. 242), "Dwelling
in the Himalayas" (Vism-mhṭ 202), Cūḷodara and Mahodara (Mhv pp. 7--8;
Dīp pp. 21--23), Aggisikha and Dhūmasikha ("Inhabitant of Sri
Lanka"---Vism-mhṭ 202), Āravāḷa and Dhanapālaka (Vin II 194--96; J-a V
333--37), Saccaka (MN 35 and 36), Ambaṭṭha (DN 3), Pokkharasāti (D I
109), Soṇadaṇḍa (DN 4), Kūṭadanta (DN 5), Āḷavaka (Sn p. 31), Sūciloma
and Kharaloma (Sn p. 47f.), Sakka (D I 263f.).



[]



[]



Or alternatively, the words *incomparable leader of men* to be tamed can
be taken together as one clause. For the Blessed One so guides men to be
tamed that in a single session they may go in the eight directions \[by
the eight liberations\] without hesitation. Thus he is called the
*incomparable leader of men to be tamed*. And the following sutta
passage should be given in full here: "Guided by the elephant-tamer,
bhikkhus, the elephant to be tamed goes in one direction ..." (M III
222).



\[TEACHER OF GODS AND MEN\]



[49.]He teaches (*anusāsati*) by means of the here and now, of
the life to come, and of the ultimate goal, according as befits the
case, thus he is the Teacher (*satthar*). And furthermore this meaning
should be understood according to the Niddesa thus: "'Teacher
(*satthar*)': the Blessed One is a caravan leader (*satthar*) since he
brings home caravans (*sattha*). Just as one who brings a caravan home
gets caravans across a wilderness, gets them across a robber-infested
wilderness, gets them across a wild-beast-infested wilderness, gets them
across a foodless wilderness, gets them across a waterless wilderness,
gets them right across, gets them quite across, gets them properly
across, gets them to reach a land of safety, so too the Blessed One is a
caravan leader, one who brings home the caravans, he gets them across a
wilderness, gets them across the wilderness of birth" (Nidd I 446).



[50.]*Of gods and men: devamanussānaṃ* = *devānañ ca manussānañ
ca* (resolution of compound). This is said in order to denote those who
are the best and also to denote those persons capable of progress. For
the Blessed One as a teacher bestowed his teaching upon animals as well.
For when animals can, through listening to the Blessed One's Dhamma,
acquire the benefit of a \[suitable rebirth as\] support \[for
progress\], and with the benefit of that same support they come, in
their second or third rebirth, to partake of the path and its fruition.



[51.]Maṇḍūka, the deity's son, and others illustrate this.
While the Blessed One was teaching the Dhamma to the inhabitants of the
city of Campā on the banks of the Gaggarā Lake, it seems, a frog
(*maṇḍūka*) apprehended a sign in the Blessed One's voice. \[209\] A
cowherd who was standing leaning on a stick put his stick on the frog's
head and crushed it. He died and was straight away reborn in a gilded,
divine palace, twelve leagues broad in the realm of the Thirty- three
(*Tāvatiṃsa*). He found himself there, as if waking up from sleep,
amidst a host of celestial nymphs, and he exclaimed, "So I have actually
been reborn here. What deed did I do?" When he sought for the reason, he
found it was none other than his apprehension of the sign in the Blessed
One's voice. He went with his divine palace at once to the Blessed One
and paid homage at his feet. Though the Blessed One knew about it, he
asked him:



"Who now pays homage at my feet,\
Shining with glory of success,\
Illuminating all around\
With beauty so outstanding?"



[]



[]



"In my last life I was a frog,\
The waters of a pond my home;\
A cowherd's crook ended my life\
While listening to your Dhamma" (Vv 49).



The Blessed One taught him the Dhamma. Eighty-four thousand creatures
gained penetration to the Dhamma. As soon as the deity's son became
established in the fruition of stream-entry he smiled and then vanished.



\[ENLIGHTENED\]



[52.]He is *enlightened*  (*buddha*) with the knowledge that
belongs to the fruit of liberation, since everything that can be known
has been discovered (*buddha*) by him.



Or alternatively, he discovered (*bujjhi*) the four truths by himself
and awakened (*bodhesi*) others to them, thus and for other such reasons
he is enlightened (*buddha*). And in order to explain this meaning the
whole passage in the Niddesa beginning thus: "He is the discoverer
(*bujjhitar*) of the truths, thus he is enlightened (*buddha*). He is
the awakened (*bodhetar*) of the generation, thus he is enlightened
(*buddha*)" (Nidd I 457), or the same passage from the Paṭisambhidā
(Paṭis I 174), should be quoted in detail.



\[BLESSED\]



[53.] Blessed (*bhagavant*) is a term signifying the respect
and veneration accorded to him as the highest of all beings and
distinguished by his special qualities.21 Hence the Ancients said:



"Blessed" is the best of words,\
"Blessed" is the finest word;\
Deserving awe and veneration,\
Blessed is the name therefore.



[54.]Or alternatively, names are of four kinds: denoting a
period of life, describing a particular mark, signifying a particular
acquirement, and fortuitously arisen,22 which last in the current usage
of the world is called "capricious." Herein, \[210\] names denoting a
period of life are those such as "yearling calf" (*vaccha*), "steer to
be trained" (*damma*), "yoke ox" (*balivaddha*), and the like. *Names
describing a particular mark* are those such as "staff-bearer"
(*daṇḍin*), "umbrella-bearer" (*chattin*), "topknot-wearer" (*sikhin*),
"hand possessor" (*karin---*elephant), and the like. *Names signifying a
particular acquirement* are those such as "possessor of the threefold
clear vision" (*tevijja*), "possessor of the six direct-knowledges"
(*chaḷabhiñña*), and the like. Such names are Sirivaḍḍhaka ("Augmenter
of



21\. For the breaking up of this compound cf. parallel passage at M-a I
10.



22\. *Āvatthika---*"denoting a period in life" (from *avatthā*, see
IV.167); not in PED; the meaning given in the PED for
*liṅgika---*"describing a particular mark," is hardly adequate for this
ref.; *nemittika---*"signifying a particular acquirement" is not in this
sense in PED. For more on names see Dhs-a 390.\



23\. The commentarial name for the Elder Sāriputta to whom the
authorship of the Paṭisambhidā is traditionally attributed. The
Paṭisambhidā text has "Buddha," not "Bhagavā."



[]



[]



Lustre"), Dhanavaḍḍhaka ("Augmenter of Wealth"), etc., are *fortuitously
arisen names*; they have no reference to the word-meanings.



[55.] This name, *Blessed*, is one signifying a particular
acquirement; it is not made by Mahā-Māyā, or by King Suddhodana, or by
the eighty thousand kinsmen, or by distinguished deities like Sakka,
Santusita, and others. And this is said by the General of the Law:23
"'Blessed': this is not a name made by a mother ... This \[name\]
'Buddha,' which signifies final liberation, is a realistic description
of Buddhas (Enlightened Ones), the Blessed Ones, together with their
obtainment of omniscient knowledge at the root of an Enlightenment
\[Tree\]" (Paṭis I 174; Nidd I 143).



[56.]Now, in order to explain also the special qualities
signified by this name they cite the following stanza:



*Bhagī bhajī bhāgī vibhattavā iti\
Akāsi bhaggan ti garū ti bhāgyavā\
Bahūhi ñāyehi subhāvitattano\
Bhavantago so bhagavā ti vuccati.*



The reverend one (*garu*) has blessings (*bhagī*), is a frequenter
(*bhajī*), a partaker



(*bhāgī*), a possessor of what has been analyzed (*vibhattavā*);



He has caused abolishing (*bhagga*), he is fortunate (*bhāgyavā*),



He has fully developed himself (*subhāvitattano*) in many ways;



He has gone to the end of becoming (*bhavantago*); thus is called
"Blessed"



(*bhagavā*).



The meaning of these words should be understood according to the method



of explanation given in the Niddesa (Nidd I 142).24



24\. "The Niddesa method is this: 'The word Blessed (*bhagavā*) is a
term of respect. Moreover, he has abolished (*bhagga*) greed, thus he is
blessed (*bhagavā*); he has abolished hate, ... delusion, ... views, ...
craving, ... defilement, thus he is blessed. "'He divided (*bhaji*),
analyzed (*vibhaji*), and classified (*paṭivibhaji*) the Dhamma
treasure, thus he is blessed (*bhagavā*). He makes an end of the kinds
of becoming (*bhavānaṃ antakaroti*), thus he is blessed (*bhagavā*). He
has developed (*bhāvita*) the body and virtue and the mind and
understanding, thus he is blessed (*bhagavā*). "'Or the Blessed One is a
frequenter (*bhajī*) of remote jungle-thicket resting places with little
noise, with few voices, with a lonely atmosphere, where one can lie
hidden from people, favourable to retreat, thus he is blessed
(*bhagavā*). "'Or the Blessed One is a partaker (*bhāgī*) of robes, alms
food, resting place, and the requisite of medicine as cure for the sick,
thus he is blessed (*bhagavā*). Or he is a partaker of the taste of
meaning, the taste of the Law, the taste of deliverance, the higher
virtue, the higher consciousness, the higher understanding, thus he is
blessed (*bhagavā*). Or he is a partaker of the four jhānas, the four
measureless states, the four immaterial states, thus he is blessed. Or
he is a partaker of the eight liberations, the eight bases of mastery,
the nine successive attainments, thus he is blessed. Or he is a partaker
of the ten developments of perception, the ten kasiṇa attainments,
concentration due to mindfulness of breathing, the attainment due to
foulness, thus he is blessed. Or he is a partaker of the ten powers of
Perfect Ones (see MN 12), of the



[]



[]



[57.]But there is this other way:



*Bhāgyavā bhaggavā yutto bhagehi ca vibhattavā.\
Bhattavā vanta-gamano bhavesu: bhagavā tato.*



He is fortunate (*bhāgyavā*), possessed of abolishment (*bhaggavā*),
associated with blessings (*yutto bhagehi*), and a possessor of what has
been analyzed (*vibhattavā*).



He has frequented (*bhattavā*), and he has rejected going in the kinds
of



becoming (*VAnta-GAmano BHAvesu*), thus he is Blessed (*Bhagavā*).



[58.] Herein, by using the characteristic of language beginning
with "vowel augmentation of syllable, elision of syllable" (see *Kāøika*
VI.3.109), or by using the characteristic of insertion beginning with
\[the example of\] *pisodara*, etc. (see Pāṇini, *Gaṇapāṭha* 6, 3, 109),
it may be known that he \[can also\] be called "blessed" (*bhagavā*)
when he can be called "fortunate" (*bhāgyavā*) owing to the
fortunateness (*bhāgya*) to have reached the further shore \[of the
ocean of perfection\] of giving, virtue, etc., which produce mundane and
supramundane bliss (See Khp-a 108.).



[59.] \[Similarly\], he \[can also\] be called "blessed"
(*bhagavā*) when he can be called "possessed of abolishment"
(*bhaggavā*) owing to the following menaces having been abolished; for
he has abolished (*abhañji*) all the hundred thousand kinds of trouble,
anxiety and defilement classed as greed, as hate, as delusion, and as
misdirected attention; as consciencelessness and shamelessness, as anger
and enmity, as contempt and domineering, as envy and avarice, as deceit
and fraud, as obduracy and presumption, as pride and haughtiness, as
vanity and negligence, as craving and ignorance; as the three roots of
the unprofitable, kinds of misconduct, defilement, stains, \[211\]
fictitious perceptions, applied thoughts, and diversifications; as the
four perversenesses, cankers, ties, floods, bonds, bad ways, cravings,
and clingings; as the five wildernesses in the heart, shackles in the
heart, hindrances, and kinds of delight; as the six roots of discord,
and groups of craving; as the seven inherent tendencies; as the eight
wrongnesses; as the nine things rooted in craving; as the ten courses of
unprofitable action; as the sixty-two kinds of \[false\] view; as the
hundred and eight ways of behaviour of craving25---or in brief, the five
Māras, that is to say, the



four kinds of perfect confidence (*ibid*), of the four discriminations,
of the six kinds of direct knowledge, of the six Enlightened Ones'
states \[not shared by disciples (see note 7)\], thus he is blessed.
Blessed One (*bhagavā*): this is not a name made by a mother ... This
name, Blessed One, is a designation based on realization"' (Vism-mhṭ
207).



25\. Here are explanations of those things in this list that cannot be
discovered by reference to the index: The pairs, "anger and enmity" to
"conceit and negligence (M I 16). The "three roots" are greed, hate, and
delusion (D III 214). The "three kinds of misconduct" are that of body,
speech, and mind (S V 75). The "three defilements" are misconduct,
craving and views (Ch. I.9,13). The "three erroneous perceptions"
(*visama- saññā*) are those connected with greed, hate, and delusion
(Vibh 368). The three "applied thoughts" are thoughts of sense-desire,
ill will, and cruelty (M I 114). The "three diversifications"
(*papañca*) are those due to craving, conceit, and \[false\] views (XVI
n. 17). "Four perversenesses": seeing permanence, pleasure, self, and
beauty, where

Māras of defilement, of the aggregates, and of kamma-formations, Māra as
a deity, and Māra as death.



And in this context it is said:



He has abolished (*bhagga*) greed and hate,\
Delusion too, he is canker-free;\
Abolished every evil state,\
"Blessed" his name may rightly be.



[60.] And by his fortunateness (*bhāgyavatā*) is indicated the
excellence of his material body which bears a hundred characteristics of
merit; and by his having abolished defects (*bhaggadosatā*) is indicated
the excellence of his Dhamma body. Likewise, \[by his fortunateness is
indicated\] the esteem of worldly \[people; and by his having abolished
defects, the esteem of\] those who resemble him. \[And by his
fortunateness it is indicated\] that he is fit to be relied on26 by
laymen; and \[by his having abolished defects that he is fit to be
relied on by\] those gone forth into homelessness; and when both have
relied on him, they acquire relief from bodily and mental pain as well
as help with both material and Dhamma gifts, and they are rendered
capable of finding both mundane and supramundane bliss.



[61.]He is also called "blessed" (*bhagavā*) since he is
"*associated with blessings*" (*bhagehi yuttattā*) such as those of the
following kind, in the sense that he "has those blessings" (*bhagā assa
santi*). Now, in the world the word "blessing" is used for six things,
namely, lordship, Dhamma, fame, glory, wish, and endeavour. He has
supreme *lordship* over his own mind, either of the kind reckoned as
mundane and consisting in "minuteness, lightness," etc.,27 or that
complete in all aspects, and likewise the supramundane *Dhamma*. And he
has exceedingly pure *fame*, spread through the three worlds, acquired
though the special quality of veracity. And he has *glory* of all limbs,
perfect in every aspect, which is capable of comforting the eyes of
people eager to see his material body. And he has his *wish*, in other
words, the production of what is wanted, since whatever is wanted and



there is none (Vibh 376). "Four cankers," etc. (XXII.47ff.). "Five
wildernesses" and "shackles" (M I 101). "Five kinds of delight": delight
in the five aggregates (XVI.93). "Six roots of discord": anger,
contempt, envy, fraud, evilness of wishes, and adherence to one's own
view (D III 246). "Nine things rooted in craving" (D III 288--89). "Ten
courses of unprofitable action": killing, stealing, sexual misconduct,
lying, slander, harsh speech, gossip, covetousness, ill will, wrong view
(M I 47, 286f.). "Sixty-two kinds of view": (D I 12ff.; MN 102). "The
hundred and eight ways of behaviour of craving" (Vibh 400).\



26\. *Abhigamanīya---*"fit to be relied on": *abhigacchati* not in PED.



27\. Vism-mhṭ says the word "*etc.*" includes the following six:
*mahimā*, *patti*, *pākamma*, *īsitā*, *vasitā*, and
*yatthakāmāvasāyitā*. "Herein, *aṇimā* means making the body minute (the
size of an atom---*aṇu*). *Laghimā* means lightness of body; walking on
air, and so on. *Mahimā* means enlargement producing hugeness of the
body. *Patti* means arriving where one wants to go. *Pākamma* means
producing what one wants by resolving, and so on. *Isitā* means
self-mastery, lordship. *Vasitā* means mastery of miraculous powers.
*Yatthakāmāvasāyitā* means attainment of perfection in all ways in one
who goes through the air or does anything else of the sort" (Vism-mhṭ
210). *Yogabhāåya* 3.45.

[]



needed by him as beneficial to himself or others is then and there
produced for him. And he has the *endeavour*, in other words, the right
effort, which is the reason why the whole world venerates him.



[62.]\[He can also\] be called "blessed" (*bhagavā*) when he
can be called "*a possessor of what has been analyzed*" (*vibhattavā*)
owing to his having analyzed \[and clarified\] all states into the
\[three\] classes beginning with the profitable; or profitable, etc.,
states into such classes as aggregates, bases, elements, truths,
faculties, dependent origination, etc.; \[212\] or the noble truth of
suffering into the senses of oppressing, being formed, burning, and
changing; and that of origin into the senses of accumulating, source,
bond, and impediment; and that of cessation into the senses of escape,
seclusion, being unformed, and deathless; and that of the path into the
senses of outlet, cause, seeing, and predominance. Having analyzed,
having revealed, having shown them, is what is meant.



[63.]He \[can also\] be called "blessed" (*bhagavā*) when he
can be called one who "*has frequented*" (*bhattavā*) owing to his
having frequented (*bhaji*), cultivated, repeatedly practiced, such
mundane and supramundane higher-than-human states as the heavenly, the
divine, and the noble abidings,28 as bodily, mental, and existential
seclusion, as the void, the desireless, and the signless liberations,
and others as well.



[64.]He \[can also\] be called "blessed" (*bhagavā*) when he
can be called one who "*has rejected going in the kinds of becoming*"
(*vantagamano bhavesu*) because in the three kinds of becoming
(*bhava*), the going (*gamana*), in other words, craving, has been
rejected (*vanta*) by him. And the syllables *bha* from the word
*bhava*, and *ga* from the word *gamana*, and *va* from the word *vanta*
with the letter a lengthened, make the word *bhagavā*, just as is done
in the world \[of the grammarians outside the Dispensation\] with the
word *mekhalā* (waist-girdle) since "garland for the private parts"
(*MEhanassa KHAssa māLĀ*) can be said.



[65.]As long as \[the meditator\] recollects the special
qualities of the Buddha in this way, "For this and this reason the
Blessed One is accomplished, ... for this and this reason he is
blessed," then: "On that occasion his mind is not obsessed by greed, or
obsessed by hate, or obsessed by delusion; his mind has rectitude on
that occasion, being inspired by the Perfect One" (A III 285).29



28\. The three "abidings" are these: heavenly abiding = kasiṇa jhāna,
divine abiding = loving-kindness jhāna, etc., noble abiding = fruition
attainment. For the three kinds\
of seclusion, see IV, note 23.\



29\. Vism-mhṭ adds seven more plays on the word *bhagavā*, which in
brief are these: he is *bhāgavā* (a possessor of parts) because he has
the Dhamma aggregates of virtue, etc. (*bhāgā* = part, *vant* =
possessor of). He is *bhatavā* (possessor of what is borne)\
because he has borne (*bhata*) the perfections to their full
development. He has cultivated the parts (*bhāge vani*), that is, he has
developed the various classes of attainments. He has cultivated the
blessings (*bhage vani*), that is, the mundane and supramundane
blessings. He is *bhattavā* (possessor of devotees) because devoted
(*bhatta*) people show devotion (*bhatti*) to him on account of his
attainments. He has rejected blessings (*bhage vami*) such as glory,
lordship, fame and so on. He has rejected the parts (*bhāge vami*) such
as the five aggregates of experience, and so on (Vism-mhṭ 241--46).



[]



[]



[66.] So when he has thus suppressed the hindrances by
preventing obsession by greed, etc., and his mind faces the meditation
subject with rectitude, then his applied thought and sustained thought
occur with a tendency toward the Enlightened One's special qualities. As
he continues to exercise applied thought and sustained thought upon the
Enlightened One's special qualities, happiness arises in him. With his
mind happy, with happiness as a proximate cause, his bodily and mental
disturbances are tranquilized by tranquillity. When the disturbances
have been tranquilized, bodily and mental bliss arise in him. When he is
blissful, his mind, with the Enlightened One's special qualities for its
object, becomes concentrated, and so the jhāna factors eventually arise
in a single moment. But owing to the profundity of the Enlightened One's
special qualities, or else owing to his being occupied in recollecting
special qualities of many sorts, the jhāna is only access and does not
reach absorption. And that access jhāna itself is known as "recollection
of the Buddha" too, because it arises with the recollection of the
Enlightened One's special qualities as the means.



[67.]When a bhikkhu is devoted to this recollection of the
Buddha, he is respectful and deferential towards the Master. He attains
fullness of faith, mindfulness, understanding and merit. He has much
happiness and gladness. He conquers fear and dread. \[213\] He is able
to endure pain. He comes to feel as if he were living in the Master's
presence. And his body, when the recollection of the Buddha's special
qualities dwells in it, becomes as worthy of veneration as a shrine
room. His mind tends toward the plane of the Buddhas. When he encounters
an opportunity for transgression, he has awareness of conscience and
shame as vivid as though he were face to face with the Master. And if he
penetrates no higher, he is at least headed for a happy destiny.



Now, when a man is truly wise,\
His constant task will surely be\
This recollection of the *Buddha\
*Blessed with such mighty potency.



This, firstly, is the section dealing with the recollection of the
Enlightened



One in the detailed explanation.



\[(2) RECOLLECTION OF THE DHAMMA\]



[68.]One who wants to develop the recollection of the Dhamma
(Law) should go into solitary retreat and recollect the special
qualities of both the Dhamma (Law) of the scriptures and the ninefold
supramundane Dhamma (state) as follows:



As to the word "*bhattavā*": at VII.63, it is explained as "one who has
frequented (*bhaji*) attainments." In this sense the attainments have
been "frequented" (*bhatta*) by him Vism-mhṭ (214 f.). uses the same
word in another sense as "possessor of devotees," expanding it as
*bhattā daḷhabhattikā assa bahu* *atthi* ("he has many devoted firm
devotees"---Skr. *bhakta*). In PED under *bhattavant* (citing also Vism
212) only the second meaning is given. *Bhatta* is from the same root
(*bhaj*) in both cases. For a short exposition of this recollection see
commentary to AN 1:16.1.



[]



[]



30\. *Anusandhi---*"sequence of meaning": a technical commentarial term
signifying both a particular subject treated in a discourse, and also
the way of linking one subject with another in the same discourse. At
M-a I 175 three kinds are distinguished: sequence of meaning in answer
to a question (*pucchānusandhi---*e.g. M I 36), that to suit a personal
idiosyncrasy, (*ajjhāsayānusandhi---*e.g. M I 23) and that due to the
natural course of the teaching (*yathānusandhi---*e.g. the whole
development of MN 6).



"The Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One, visible here and now,
not delayed (timeless), inviting of inspection, onward-leading, and
directly experienceable by the wise" (M I 37; A III 285).



\[WELL  PROCLAIMED\]



[69.]*Well proclaimed*: in this clause the Dhamma of the
scriptures is included as well as the other; in the rest of the clauses
only the supramundane Dhamma is included.



Herein, the Dhamma of the scriptures is well proclaimed because it is
good in the beginning, the middle, and the end, and because it announces
the life of purity that is utterly perfect and pure with meaning and
with detail (see M I 179).



Even a single stanza of the Blessed One's teaching is good in the
beginning with the first word, good in the middle with the second,
third, etc., and good in the end with the last word, because the Dhamma
is altogether admirable. A sutta with a single sequence of meaning30 is
good in the beginning with the introduction, good in the end with the
conclusion, and good in the middle with what is in between. A sutta with
several sequences of meaning is good in the beginning with the first
sequence of meaning, good in the end with the last sequence of meaning,
and good in the middle with the sequences of meaning in between.
Furthermore, it is good in the beginning with the introduction \[giving
the place of\] and the origin \[giving the reason for\] its utterance.
It is good in the middle because it suits those susceptible of being
taught since it is unequivocal in meaning and reasoned with cause and
example. It is good in the end with its conclusion that inspires faith
in the hearers.



[70.]Also the entire Dhamma of the Dispensation is good in the
beginning with virtue as one's own well-being. It is good in the middle
with serenity and insight and with path and fruition. It is good in the
end with Nibbāna. Or alternatively, it is good in the beginning with
virtue and concentration. \[214\] It is good in the middle with insight
and the path. It is good in the end with fruition and Nibbāna. Or
alternatively, it is good in the beginning because it is the good
discovery made by the Buddha. It is good in the middle because it is the
well-regulatedness of the Dhamma. It is good in the end because it is
the good way entered upon by the Saṅgha. Or alternatively, it is good in
the beginning as the discovery of what can be attained by one who enters
upon the way of practice in conformity after hearing about it. It is
good in the middle as the unproclaimed enlightenment \[of
Paccekabuddhas\]. It is good in the end as the enlightenment of
disciples.



[71.]And when listened to, it does good through hearing it
because it suppresses the hindrances, thus it is good in the beginning.
And when made the way of



[]



[]



practice it does good through the way being entered upon because it
brings the bliss of serenity and insight, thus it is good in the middle.
And when it has thus been made the way of practice and the fruit of the
way is ready, it does good through the fruit of the way because it
brings \[unshakable\] equipoise, thus it is good in the end.



So it is "well proclaimed" because of being good in the beginning, the
middle



and the end.



[72.]Now, the life of purity, that is to say, the life of
purity of the Dispensation and the life of purity of the path, which the
Blessed One announces, which he shows in various ways when he teaches
the Dhamma, is "with meaning" because of perfection of meaning, and it
is "with detail" because of perfection of detail, as it is proper that
it should be. It is "with meaning" because it conforms to the words
declaring its meaning by pronouncing, clarifying, revealing, expounding,
and explaining it. It is "with detail" because it has perfection of
syllables, words, details, style, language, and descriptions. It is
"with meaning" owing to profundity of meaning and profundity of
penetration. It is "with detail" owing to profundity of law and
profundity of teaching. It is "with meaning" because it is the province
of the discriminations of meaning and of perspicuity. It is "with
detail" because it is the province of the discriminations of law and of
language (see XIV.21). It is "with meaning" since it inspires confidence
in persons of discretion, being experienceable by the wise. It is "with
detail" since it inspires confidence in worldly persons, being a fit
object of faith. It is "with meaning" because its intention is profound.
It is "with detail" because its words are clear. It is "utterly perfect"
with the complete perfection due to absence of anything that can be
added. It is "pure" with the immaculateness due to absence of anything
to be subtracted.



[73.] Furthermore, it is "with meaning" because it provides the
particular distinction31 of achievement through practice of the way, and
it is "with detail" because it provides the particular distinction of
learning through mastery of scripture. It is "utterly perfect" because
it is connected with the five aggregates of Dhamma beginning with
virtue.32 It is "pure" because it has no imperfection, because it exists
for the purpose of crossing over \[the round of rebirths' flood (see M I
134)\], and because it is not concerned with worldly things.



So it is "well proclaimed" because it "announces the life of purity that
is



utterly perfect and pure with meaning and with detail."



Or alternatively, it is *well proclaimed* since it has been properly
proclaimed with no perversion of meaning. For the meaning of other
sectarians' law suffers perversion since there is actually no
obstruction in the \[215\] things described there as obstructive and
actually no outlet in the things described there as outlets,



31\. *Vyatti* (*byatti*)---"particular distinction" (n. fm. *vi* +
*añj*); not so spelt in PED but see *viyatti*. Glossed by Vism-mhṭ with
*veyyatti*.



32\. These "five aggregates" are those of virtue, concentration,
understanding, deliverance, and knowledge and vision of deliverance.



[]



[]



which is why their law is ill-proclaimed; but not so the Blessed One's
Law, whose meaning suffers no perversion since the things described
there as obstructions and the things described there as outlets are so
in actual fact.



So, in the first place, the Dhamma of the scriptures is "well
proclaimed."



[74.] The supramundane Dhamma is *well proclaimed* since both
the way that accords with Nibbāna and the Nibbāna that accords with the
way have been proclaimed, according as it is said: "The way leading to
Nibbāna has been properly declared to the disciples by the Blessed One,
and Nibbāna and the way meet. Just as the water of the Ganges meets and
joins with the water of the Yamunā, so too the way leading to Nibbāna
has been properly declared to the disciples by the Blessed One, and
Nibbāna and the way meet" (D II 223).



[75.]And here the noble path, which is the middle way since it
does not approach either extreme, is *well proclaimed* in being
proclaimed to be the middle way.



The fruits of asceticism, where defilements are tranquilized, are *well
proclaimed*



too in being proclaimed to have tranquilized defilement.



Nibbāna, whose individual essence is eternal, deathless, the refuge, the
shelter, etc., is *well proclaimed* too in being proclaimed to have an
individual essence that is eternal, and so on.



So the supramundane Dhamma is also "well proclaimed."



\[VISIBLE HERE AND NOW\]



[76.]*Visible here and now*: firstly, the noble path is
"visible here and now" since it can be seen by a noble person himself
when he has done away with greed, etc., in his own continuity, according
as it is said: "When a man is dyed with greed, brahman, and is
overwhelmed and his mind is obsessed by greed, then he thinks for his
own affliction, he thinks for others' affliction, he thinks for the
affliction of both, and he experiences mental suffering and grief. When
greed has been abandoned, he neither thinks for his own affliction, nor
thinks for others' affliction, nor thinks for the affliction of both,
and he does not experience mental suffering and grief. This, brahman, is
how the Dhamma is visible here and now" (A I 156). \[216\]



[77.]Furthermore, the ninefold supramundane Dhamma is also
*visible here and now*, since when anyone has attained it, it is visible
to him through reviewing knowledge without his having to rely on faith
in another.



[78.]Or alternatively, the view (*diṭṭhi*) that is recommended
(*pasattha---*pp. of root *saṃs*) is "proper view" (*sandiṭṭhi*). It
conquers by means of proper view, thus it "has proper view"
(*sandiṭṭhika---*"visible here and now"). For in this way the noble path
conquers defilements by means of the proper view associated with it, and
the noble fruition does so by means of the proper view that is its
cause, and Nibbāna does so by means of the proper view that has Nibbāna
as its objective field. So the ninefold supramundane Dhamma "has the
proper view" (*sandiṭṭhika---*"is visible here and now") since it
conquers by means of proper view, just as a charioteer (*rathika*) is so
called because he conquers by means of a chariot (*ratha*).



[]



[]



[79.] Or alternatively, it is seeing (*dassana*) that is called
"the seen" (*diṭṭha*); then *diṭṭha* and *sandiṭṭha* are identical in
meaning as "seeing." It is worthy of being seen (*diṭṭha*), thus it is
"visible here and now" (*sandiṭṭhika*). For the supramundane Dhamma
(law) arrests the fearful round \[of kamma, etc.,\] as soon as it is
seen by means of penetration consisting in development \[of the path\]
and by means of penetration consisting in realization \[of Nibbāna\]. So
it is "visible here and now" (*sandiṭṭhika*) since it is worthy of being
seen (*diṭṭha*), just as one who is clothable (*vattihika*)33 is so
called because he is worthy of clothes (*vattha*).



\[NOT  DELAYED\]



[80.]It has no delay (lit. "takes no time"---*kāla*) in the
matter of giving its own fruit, thus it is "without delay" (*akāla*).
"Without delay" is the same as "not delayed" (*akālika*). What is meant
is that instead of giving its fruit after creating a delay (using up
time), say, five days, seven days, it gives its fruit immediately next
to its own occurrence (see Sn 226).



[81.] Or alternatively, what is delayed (*kālika---*lit. "what
takes time") is what needs some distant34 time to be reached before it
can give its fruit. What is that? It is the mundane law of profitable
\[kamma\]. This, however, is undelayed (*na kālika*) because its fruit
comes immediately next to it, so it is "not delayed" (*akālika*).



This is said with reference to the path.



\[INVITING OF INSPECTION\]



[82.]It is worthy of an invitation to inspect
(*ehipassa-vidhi*) given thus: "Come and see this Dhamma" (*ehi passa
imaṃ dhammaṃ*), thus it is "inviting of inspection" (*ehipassika*). But
why is it worthy of this invitation? Because it is found and because of
its purity. For if a man has said that there is money or gold in an
empty fist, he cannot say, "Come and see it." Why not? Because it is not
found. And on the other hand, while dung or urine may well be found, a
man cannot, for the purpose of cheering the mind by exhibiting beauty,
say, "Come



33\. *Vatthika---*"clothable"; not in PED.\



34\. *Pakaṭṭha---*"distant"; not in PED (= *dura---*Vism-mhṭ 297).



35\. This passage is only loosely renderable because the exegesis here
is based almost entirely on the substitution of one Pali grammatical
form for another (*padasiddhi*). The reading *opaneyyiko* (for
*opanayiko*) does not appear in any Sinhalese text (generally the most
reliable); consequently the sentence "*opanayiko va opaneyyiko*" (see
Harvard text) is absent in them, being superfluous. Vism-mhṭ's
explanations are incorporated. This paragraph depends on the double
sense of *upaneti*  (*upa* + *neti*, to lead on or induce) and its
derivatives as (i) an attractive inducement and (ii) a reliable guide,
and so the word *induce* is stretched a bit and *inducive* coined on the
analogy of conducive. *Upanaya* (inducement) is not in PED, nor is
*upanayana* (inducing) in this sense (see also XIV.68). *Upanayana*
means in logic "application," "subsumption"; and also *upanetabba* means
"to be added"; see end of §72. For *allīyana* ("treating as one's
shelter") see references in Glossary.



[]



[]



and see this;" on the contrary, they have to be covered up with grass
and leaves. Why? Because of their impurity. But this ninefold
supramundane Dhamma is actually found as such in its individual essence,
and it is as pure as the full moon's disk in a cloudless sky, as a gem
of pure water on bleached cloth. \[217\] Consequently, it is worthy of
the invitation to inspect since it is found and pure, thus it is
"inviting of inspection."



\[ONWARD-LEADING\]



[83.] The word *opanayika* ("onward-leading") is \[equivalent
to the gerund\] *upanetabba* ("ought to---can---be induced"). Here is an
exposition. An inducing (*upanayana*) is an inducement (*upanaya*). \[As
the four paths and four fruitions\] this \[Dhamma\] is worth inducing
(*upanayanaṃ arahati*) \[that is, arousing\] *in* one's own mind
\[subjectively\] by means of development, without any question of
whether or not one's clothing or one's head is on fire (see A IV 320),
thus it is "onward-leading" (*opanayika*). This applies to the
\[above-mentioned eight\] formed supramundane states (dhammas). But the
unformed \[dhamma\] is worth inducing *by* one's own mind \[to become
the mind's object\], thus it is "onward- leading," too; the meaning is
that it is worth treating as one's shelter by realizing it.



[84.] Or alternatively, what induces (*upaneti*) \[the noble
person\] onwards to Nibbāna is the noble path, which is thus inductive
(*upaneyya*). Again, what can (ought to) be induced (*upanetabba*) to
realizability is the Dhamma consisting in fruition and Nibbāna, which is
thus inductive (*upaneyya*), too. The word *upaneyya* is the same as the
word *opanayika*.35



\[IS  DIRECTLY  EXPERIENCEABLE  BY  THE  WISE\]



[85.]*Is directly experienceable by the wise*: it can be
experienced by all the kinds of wise men beginning with the "acutely
wise" (see A II 135) each in himself thus: "The path has been developed,
fruition attained, and cessation realized, by me." For it does not
happen that when a preceptor has developed the path his co- resident
abandons his defilements, nor does a co-resident dwell in comfort owing
to the preceptor's attainment of fruition, nor does he realize the
Nibbāna realized by the preceptor. So this is not visible in the way
that an ornament on another's head is, but rather it is visible only in
one's own mind. What is meant is that it can be undergone by wise men,
but it is not the province of fools.



[86.] Now, in addition, this Dhamma is well proclaimed. Why?
Because it is visible here and now. It is visible here and now because
it is not delayed. It is not delayed because it invites inspection. And
what invites inspection is onward- leading.



[87.]As long as \[the meditator\] recollects the special
qualities of the Dhamma in this way, then: "On that occasion his mind is
not obsessed by greed, or obsessed by hate, or obsessed by delusion; his
mind has rectitude on that occasion, being inspired by the Dhamma" (A
III 285).



So when he has suppressed the hindrances in the way already described



(§66), the jhāna factors arise in a single conscious moment. But owing
to the



[]



[]



profundity of the Dhamma's special qualities, or else owing to his being
occupied in recollecting special qualities of many sorts, the jhāna is
only access and does not reach absorption. And that access jhāna itself
is known as "recollection of the Dhamma" too because it arises with the
recollection of the Dhamma's special qualities as the means.



[88.] \[218\] When a bhikkhu is devoted to this recollection of
the Dhamma, he thinks: "I never in the past met a master who taught a
law that led onward thus, who possessed this talent, nor do I now see
any such a master other than the Blessed One." Seeing the Dhamma's
special qualities in this way, he is respectful and deferential towards
the Master. He entertains great reverence for the Dhamma and attains
fullness of faith, and so on. He has much happiness and gladness. He
conquers fear and dread. He is able to endure pain. He comes to feel as
if he were living in the Dhamma's presence. And his body, when the
recollection of the Dhamma's special qualities dwells in it, becomes as
worthy of veneration as a shrine room. His mind tends towards the
realization of the peerless Dhamma. When he encounters an opportunity
for transgression, he has vivid awareness of conscience and shame on
recollecting the well-regulatedness of the Dhamma. And if he penetrates
no higher, he is at least headed for a happy destiny.



Now, when a man is truly wise,\
His constant task will surely be\
This recollection of the *Dhamma\
*Blessed with such mighty potency.



This is the section dealing with the recollection of the Dhamma in the
detailed



explanation.



\[(3) RECOLLECTION OF THE SAÒGHA\]



[89.]One who wants to develop the recollection of the Community
should go into solitary retreat and recollect the special qualities of
the community of Noble Ones as follows:



"The community of the Blessed One's disciples has entered on the good
way, the community of the Blessed One's disciples has entered on the
straight way, the community of the Blessed One's disciples has entered
on the true way, the community of the Blessed One's disciples has
entered on the proper way, that is to say, the four pairs of men, the
eight persons; this community of the Blessed One's disciples is fit for
gifts, fit for hospitality, fit for offerings, fit for reverential
salutation, as an incomparable field of merit for the world" (A III
286).



\[ENTERED ON THE GOOD, STRAIGHT, TRUE, PROPER WAY\]



[90.] Herein,  *entered on the good way* (*supaṭipanna*) is
thoroughly entered on the way (*suṭṭhu paṭipanna*). What is meant is
that it has entered on a way (*paṭipanna*) that is the right way
(*sammā-paṭipadā*), the way that is irreversible, the way that is in
conformity \[with truth\], the way that has no opposition, the way that
is regulated by the Dhamma. They hear (*suṇanti*) attentively the
Blessed One's instruction, thus they are his disciples (*sāvaka---*lit.
"hearers"). *The community of*



[]



[]



*the disciples* is the community of those disciples. The meaning is that
the total of disciples forms a communality because it possesses in
common both virtue and \[right\] view. \[219\] That right way, being
*straight*, unbent, uncrooked, unwarped, is called noble and *true* and
is known as *proper* owing to its becomingness, therefore the noble
community that has entered on that is also said to have *entered on the
straight way*, *entered on the true way*, and *entered on the proper
way*.



[91.]Those who stand on the path can be understood to have
*entered on the good way* since they possess the right way. And those
who stand in fruition can be understood to have *entered on the good
way* with respect to the way that is now past since by means of the
right way they have realized what should be realized.



[92.] Furthermore, the Community *has entered on the good way*
because it has entered on the way according as instructed in the
well-proclaimed Dhamma and Discipline (*dhamma-vinaya*), and because it
has entered on the immaculate way. It *has entered on the straight way*
because it has entered on the way avoiding the two extremes and taking
the middle course, and because it has entered on the way of the
abandonment of the faults of bodily and verbal crookedness, tortuousness
and warpedness. It *has entered on the true way* because Nibbāna is what
is called "true" and it has entered on the way with that as its aim. It
*has entered on the proper way* because it has entered on the way of
those who are worthy of proper acts \[of veneration\].



[93.] The word *yadidaṃ* ("that is to say") = *yāni imāni*. 
*The four pairs of men*: taking them pairwise, the one who stands on the
first path and the one who stands in the first fruition as one pair, in
this way there are four pairs. *The eight persons*: taking them by
persons, the one who stands on the first path as one and the one who
stands in the first fruition as one, in this way there are eight
persons. And there in the compound *purisa-puggala* (persons) the words
*purisa* and *puggala* have the same meaning, but it is expressed in
this way to suit differing susceptibility to teaching.



*This community of the Blessed One's disciples*: this community of the
Blessed One's disciples taken by pairs as the four pairs of men
(*purisa*) and individually as the eight persons (*purisa-puggala*).



\[FIT FOR GIFTS\]



[94.]As to *fit for gifts*, etc.: what should be brought
(*ānetvā*) and given (*hunitabba*) is a gift (*āhuna---*lit.
"sacrifice"); the meaning is, what is to be brought even from far away
and donated to the virtuous. It is a term for the four requisites. The
Community is fit to receive that gift (sacrifice) because it makes it
bear great fruit, thus it is "fit for gifts" (*āhuneyya*).



[95.]Or alternatively, all kinds of property, even when the
bringer comes (*āgantvā*) from far away, can be given (*hunitabba*)
here, thus the Community "can be given to" (*āhavanīya*); or it is fit
to be given to by Sakka and others, thus it "can be given to." And the
brahmans' fire is called "to be given (sacrificed) to" (*āhavanīya*),
for they believe that what is sacrificed to it brings great fruit.
\[220\] But if something is to be sacrificed to for the sake of the
great fruit brought by what is sacrificed to



[]



[]



it, then surely the Community should be sacrificed to; for what is
sacrificed (given) to the Community has great fruit, according as it is
said:



"Were anyone to serve the fire\
Out in the woods a hundred years,\
And pay one moment's homage too\
To men of self-development,\
His homage would by far excel\
His hundred years of sacrifice" (Dhp 107).



And the words *āhavanīya* ("to be sacrificed to"), which is used in the
schools,36 is the same in meaning as this word *āhuneyya* ("fit for
gifts") used here. There is only the mere trifling difference of
syllables. So it is "fit for gifts."



\[FIT  FOR  HOSPITALITY\]



[96.]*Fit for hospitality*  (*pāhuneyya*): "hospitality"
(*pāhuna*) is what a donation to visitors is called, prepared with all
honours for the sake of dear and beloved relatives and friends who have
come from all quarters. But even more than to such objects of
hospitality, it is fitting that it should be given also to the
Community; for there is no object of hospitality so fit to receive
hospitality as the Community since it is encountered after an interval
between Buddhas and possesses wholly endearing and lovable qualities. So
it is "fit for hospitality" since the hospitality is fit to be given to
it and it is fit to receive it.



But those who take the text to be *pāhavanīya* ("fit to be given
hospitality to") have it that the Community is worthy to be placed first
and so what is to be given should first of all be brought here and given
(*sabba-Paṭhamaṃ Ānetvā ettha HUNitabbaṃ*), and for that reason it is
"fit to be given hospitality to" (*pāhavanīya*) or since it is worthy to
be given to in all aspects (*sabba-Pakārena ĀHAVANAṃ arahati*), it is
thus "fit to be given hospitality to" (*pāhavanīya*). And here this is
called  *pāhuneyya* in the same sense.



\[FIT FOR OFFERING\]



[97.]"Offering" (*dakkhiṇa*) is what a gift is called that is
to be given out of faith in the world to come. The Community is worthy
of that offering, or it is helpful to that offering because it purifies
it by making it of great fruit, thus it is *fit for offerings* 
(*dakkhiṇeyya*).



\[FIT FOR SALUTATION\]



It is worthy of being accorded by the whole world the reverential
salutation (*añjali-kamma*) consisting in placing both hands \[palms
together\] above the head, thus it is *fit for reverential salutation* 
(*añjalikaraṇīya*).



\[AS AN INCOMPARABLE FIELD OF MERIT FOR THE WORLD\]



[98.]*As an incomparable field of merit for the world*: as a
place without equal in the world for growing merit; just as the place
for growing the king's or minister's



36\. "In the Sarvāstivādin school and so on" (Vism-mhṭ 230).



[]



[]



rice or corn is the king's rice-field or the king's corn-field, so the
Community is the place for growing the whole world's merit. For the
world's various kinds of merit leading to welfare and happiness grow
with the Community as their support. Therefore the Community is "an
incomparable field of merit for the world."



[99.] As long as he recollects the special qualities of the
Saṅgha in this way, classed as "having entered on the good way," etc.,
\[221\] then: "On that occasion his mind is not obsessed by greed, or
obsessed by hate, or obsessed by delusion; his mind has rectitude on
that occasion, being inspired by the Saṅgha" (A III 286).



So when he has suppressed the hindrances in the way already described
(§66), the jhāna factors arise in a single conscious moment. But owing
to the profundity of the Community's special qualities, or else owing to
his being occupied in recollecting special qualities of many sorts, the
jhāna is only access and does not reach absorption. And that access
jhāna itself is known as "recollection of the Saṅgha" too because it
arises with the recollection of the Community's special qualities as the
means.



[100.]When a bhikkhu is devoted to this recollection of the
Community, he is respectful and deferential towards the Community. He
attains fullness of faith, and so on. He has much happiness and bliss.
He conquers fear and dread. He is able to endure pain. He comes to feel
as if he were living in the Community's presence. And his body, when the
recollection of the Sangha's special qualities dwells in it, becomes as
worthy of veneration as an Uposatha house where the Community has met.
His mind tends towards the attainment of the Community's special
qualities. When he encounters an opportunity for transgression, he has
awareness of conscience and shame as vividly as if he were face to face
with the Community. And if he penetrates no higher, he is at least
headed for a happy destiny.



Now, when a man is truly wise,\
His constant task will surely be\
This recollection of the *Saṅgha\
*Blessed with such mighty potency.



This is the section dealing with the recollection of the Community in
the



detailed explanation.



\[(4) RECOLLECTION OF VIRTUE\]



[101.] One who wants to develop the recollection of virtue
should go into solitary retreat and recollect his own different kinds of
virtue in their special qualities of being untorn, etc., as follows:



Indeed, my various kinds of virtue are "untorn, unrent, unblotched,
unmottled, liberating, praised by the wise, not adhered to, and
conducive to concentration" (A III 286). And a layman should recollect
them in the form of laymen's virtue while one gone forth into
homelessness should recollect them in the form of the virtue of those
gone forth.



[]



[]



[102.] Whether they are the virtues of laymen or of those gone
forth, when no one of them is broken in the beginning or in the end, not
being torn like a cloth ragged at the ends, then they are *untorn*.
\[222\] When no one of them is broken in the middle, not being rent like
a cloth that is punctured in the middle, then they are  *unrent*. When
they are not broken twice or thrice in succession, not being blotched
like a cow whose body is some such colour as black or red with
discrepant-coloured oblong or round patch appearing on her back or
belly, then they are *unblotched*. When they are not broken all over at
intervals, not being mottled like a cow speckled with
discrepant-coloured spots, then they are *unmottled*.



[103.] Or in general they are *untorn*, *unrent*, *unblotched*,
*unmottled* when they are undamaged by the seven bonds of sexuality
(I.144) and by anger and enmity and the other evil things (see §59).



[104.] Those same virtues are *liberating* since they liberate
by freeing from the slavery of craving. They are *praised by the wise*
because they are praised by such wise men as Enlightened Ones. They are
*not adhered to* (*aparāmaṭṭha*) since they are not adhered to
(*aparāmaṭṭhattā*) with craving and \[false\] view, or because of the
impossibility of misapprehending (*parāmaṭṭhuṃ*) that "There is this
flaw in your virtues." They are *conducive to concentration* since they
conduce to access concentration and absorption concentration, or to path
concentration and fruition concentration.



[105.] As long as he recollects his own virtues in their
special qualities of being untorn, etc., in this way, then: "On that
occasion his mind is not obsessed by greed, or obsessed by hate, or
obsessed by delusion, his mind has rectitude on that occasion, being
inspired by virtue" (A III 286).



So when he has suppressed the hindrances in the way already described
(§66), the jhāna factors arise in a single conscious moment. But owing
to the profundity of the virtues' special qualities, or owing to his
being occupied in recollecting special qualities of many sorts, the
jhāna is only access and does not reach absorption. And that access
jhāna itself is known as "recollection of virtue" too because it arises
with the virtues' special qualities as the means.



[106.] And when a bhikkhu is devoted to this recollection of
virtue, he has respect for the training. He lives in communion \[with
his fellows in the life of purity\]. He is sedulous in welcoming. He is
devoid of the fear of self-reproach and so on. He sees fear in the
slightest fault. He attains fullness of faith, and so on. He has much
happiness and gladness. And if he penetrates no higher, he is at least
headed for a happy destiny.



Now, when a man is truly wise,\
His constant task will surely be\
This recollection of his virtue\
Blessed with such mighty potency.



This is the section dealing with the recollection of virtue in the
detailed



explanation. \[223\]



[]



[]



\[(5) RECOLLECTION  OF  GENEROSITY\]



[107.] One who wants to develop the recollection of generosity
should be naturally devoted to generosity and the constant practice of
giving and sharing. Or alternatively, if he is one who is starting the
development of it, he should make the resolution: "From now on, when
there is anyone present to receive, I shall not eat even a single
mouthful without having given a gift." And that very day he should give
a gift by sharing according to his means and his ability with those who
have distinguished qualities. When he has apprehended the sign in that,
he should go into solitary retreat and recollect his own generosity in
its special qualities of being free from the stain of avarice, etc., as
follows:



"It is gain for me, it is great gain for me, that in a generation
obsessed by the stain of avarice I abide with my heart free from stain
by avarice, and am freely generous and open-handed, that I delight in
relinquishing, expect to be asked, and rejoice in giving and sharing" (A
III 287).



[108.] Herein, *it is gain for me*: it is my gain, advantage.
The intention is: I surely partake of those kinds of gain for a giver
that have been commended by the Blessed One as follows: "A man who gives
life \[by giving food\] shall have life either divine or human" (A III
42), and: "A giver is loved and frequented by many" (A III 40), and:
"One who gives is ever loved, according to the wise man's law" (A III
41), and so on.



[109.] *It is great gain for me*: it is great gain for me that
this Dispensation, or the human state, has been gained by me. Why?
Because of the fact that "I abide *with my mind free from stain by
avarice* ... *and rejoice in giving and sharing*."



[110.] Herein, *obsessed by the stain of avarice* is
overwhelmed by the stain of avarice. *Generation*: beings, so called
owing to the fact of their being generated. So the meaning here is this:
among beings who are overwhelmed by the stain of avarice, which is one
of the dark states that corrupt the \[natural\] transparency of
consciousness (see A I 10) and which has the characteristic of inability
to bear sharing one's own good fortune with others.



[111.] *Free from stain by avarice* because of being both free
from avarice and from the other stains, greed, hate, and the rest. *I
abide with my heart*: I abide with my consciousness of the kind already
stated, is the meaning. \[224\] But in the sutta, "I live the home life
with my heart free" (A III 287; V 331), etc., is said because it was
taught there as a \[mental\] abiding to depend on \[constantly\] to
Mahānāma the Sakyan, who was a stream-enterer asking about an abiding to
depend on. There the meaning is "I live overcoming ..."



[112.] *Freely generous*: liberally generous. *Open-handed*:
with hands that are purified. What is meant is: with hands that are
always washed in order to give gifts carefully with one's own hands.
*That I delight in relinquishing*: the act of relinquishing
(*vossajjana*) is relinquishing (*vossagga*); the meaning is, giving up.
To delight in relinquishing is to delight in constant devotion to that
relinquishing. *Expect to be asked*  (*yācayoga*): accustomed to being
asked (*yācana-yogga*) because of giving whatever others ask for, is the
meaning. *Yājayoga* is a reading, in which case the meaning is: devoted
(*yutta*) to sacrifice (*yāja*), in other words, to



[]



[]



sacrificing (*yajana*).  *And rejoice in sharing*: the meaning is, he
recollects thus: "I give gifts and I share out what is to be used by
myself, and I rejoice in both."



[113.] As long as he recollects his own generosity in its
special qualities of freedom from stain by avarice, etc., in this way,
then: "On that occasion his mind is not obsessed by greed, or obsessed
by hate, or obsessed by delusion; his mind has rectitude on that
occasion, being inspired by generosity" (A III 287).



So when he has suppressed the hindrances in the way already described
(§66), the jhāna factors arise in a single conscious moment. But owing
to the profundity of the generosity's special qualities, or owing to his
being occupied in recollecting the generosity's special qualities of
many sorts, the jhāna is only access and does not reach absorption. And
that access jhāna is known as "recollection of generosity" too because
it arises with the generosity's special qualities as the means.



[114.] And when a bhikkhu is devoted to this recollection of
generosity, he becomes ever more intent on generosity, his preference is
for non-greed, he acts in conformity with loving-kindness, he is
fearless. He has much happiness and gladness. And if he penetrates no
higher, he is at least headed for a happy destiny.



Now, when a man is truly wise,\
His constant task will surely be\
This recollection of his giving\
Blessed with such mighty potency.



This is the section dealing with the recollection of generosity in the
detailed



explanation. \[225\]



\[(6) RECOLLECTION  OF  DEITIES\]



[115.] One who wants to develop the recollection of deities
should possess the special qualities of faith, etc., evoked by means of
the noble path, and he should go into solitary retreat and recollect his
own special qualities of faith, etc., with deities standing as
witnesses, as follows:



"There are deities of the Realm of the Four Kings (*devā
cātummahārājikā*), there are deities of the Realm of the Thirty-three
(*devā tāvatiṃsā*), there are deities who are Gone to Divine Bliss
(*yāmā*) ... who are Contented (*tusitā*) ... who Delight in Creating
(*nimmānarati*) ... who Wield Power Over Others' Creations
(*paranimmitavasavatti*), there are deities of Brahmā's Retinue
(*brahmakāyikā*), there are deities higher than that. And those deities
were possessed of faith such that on dying here they were reborn there,
and such faith is present in me too. And those deities were possessed of
virtue ... of learning ... of generosity ... of understanding such that
when they died here they were reborn there, and such understanding is
present in me too" (A III 287).



[116.] In the sutta, however, it is said: "On the occasion,
Mahānāma, on which a noble disciple recollects the faith, the virtue,
the learning, the generosity, and the understanding that are both his
own and of those deities," on that occasion his mind is not obsessed by
greed ..." (A III 287). Although this is said, it should



[]



[]



nevertheless be understood as said for the purpose of showing that the
special qualities of faith, etc., in oneself are those in the deities,
making the deities stand as witnesses. For it is said definitely in the
Commentary: "He recollects his own special qualities, making the deities
stand as witnesses."



[117.] As long as in the prior stage he recollects the deities'
special qualities of faith, etc., and in the later stage he recollects
the special qualities of faith, etc., existing in himself, then: "On
that occasion his mind is not obsessed by greed, or obsessed by hate, or
obsessed by delusion, his mind has rectitude on that occasion, being
inspired by deities" (A III 288).



So when he has suppressed the hindrances in the way already stated
(§66), the jhāna factors arise in a single conscious moment. But owing
to the profundity of the special qualities of faith, etc., or owing to
his being occupied in recollecting special qualities of many sorts, the
jhāna is only access and does not reach absorption. And that access
jhāna itself is known as "recollection of deities" too because it arises
with the deities special qualities as the means. \[226\]



[118.] And when a bhikkhu is devoted to this recollection of
deities, he becomes dearly loved by deities. He obtains even greater
fullness of faith. He has much happiness and gladness. And if he
penetrates no higher, he is at least headed for a happy destiny.



Now, when a man is truly wise,\
His constant task will surely be\
This recollection of deities\
Blessed with such mighty potency.



This is the section dealing with the recollection of deities in the
detailed



explanation.



\[GENERAL\]



[119.] Now, in setting forth the detail of these recollections,
after the words, "His mind has rectitude on that occasion, being
inspired by the Perfect One," it is added: "When a noble disciple's mind
has rectitude, Mahānāma, the meaning inspires him, the law inspires him,
and the application of the law makes him glad. When he is glad,
happiness is born in him" (A III 285--88). Herein, *the meaning inspires
him* should be understood as said of contentment inspired by the meaning
beginning, "This Blessed One is such since he is ..." (§2). *The law
inspires him* is said of contentment inspired by the text. The
*application of the law makes him glad* is said of both (cf. M-a I 173).



[120.] And when in the case of the recollection of deities
*inspired by deities* is said, this should be understood as said either
of the consciousness that occurs in the prior stage inspired by deities
or of the consciousness \[that occurs in the later stage\] inspired by
the special qualities that are similar to those of the deities and are
productive of the deities' state (cf. §117).



[121.] These six recollections succeed only in noble disciples.
For the special qualities of the Enlightened One, the Law, and the
Community, are evident to them; and they possess the virtue with the
special qualities of untornness, etc.,



[]



[]



the generosity that is free from stain by avarice, and the special
qualities of faith, etc., similar to those of deities.



[122.] And in the Mahānāma Sutta (A III 285 f.) they are
expounded in detail by the Blessed One in order to show a stream-winner
an abiding to depend upon when he asked for one.



[123.] Also in the Gedha Sutta they are expounded in order that
a noble disciple should purify his consciousness by means of the
recollections and so attain further purification in the ultimate sense
thus: "Here, bhikkhus, a noble disciple recollects the Perfect One in
this way: That Blessed One is such since he is accomplished ... His mind
has rectitude on that occasion. He has renounced, \[227\] got free from,
emerged from cupidity. Cupidity, bhikkhus, is a term for the five cords
of sense desire. Some beings gain purity here by making this
\[recollection\] their prop" (A III 312).



[124.] And in the Sambādhokāsa Sutta taught by the venerable
Mahā-Kaccāna they are expounded as the realization of the wide-open
through the susceptibility of purification that exists in the ultimate
sense only in a noble disciple thus: "It is wonderful, friends, it is
marvellous how the realization of the wide-open in the crowded \[house
life\] has been discovered by the Blessed One who knows and sees,
accomplished and fully enlightened, for the purification of beings,
\[for the surmounting of sorrow and lamentation, for the ending of pain
and grief, for the attainment of the true way\], for the realization of
Nibbāna, that is to say, the six stations of recollection. What six?
Here, friends, a noble disciple recollects the Perfect One ... Some
beings are susceptible to purification in this way" (A III 314--15).



[125.] Also in the Uposatha Sutta they are expounded in order
to show the greatness of the fruit of the Uposatha, as a mind-purifying
meditation subject for a noble disciple who is observing the Uposatha:
"And what is the Noble Ones' Uposatha, Visākhā? It is the gradual
cleansing of the mind still sullied by imperfections. And what is the
gradual cleansing of the mind still sullied by imperfections? Here,
Visākhā, a noble disciple recollects the Perfect One ..." (A I 206--11).



[126.] And in the Book of Elevens, when a noble disciple has
asked, "Venerable sir, in what way should we abide who abide in various
ways?" (A V 328), they are expounded to him in order to show the way of
abiding in this way: "One who has faith is successful, Mahānāma, not one
who has no faith. One who is energetic ... One whose mindfulness is
established ... One who is concentrated ... One who has understanding is
successful, Mahānāma, not one who has no understanding. Having
established yourself in these five things, Mahānāma, you should develop
six things. Here, Mahānāma, you should recollect the Perfect One: That
Blessed One is such since ..." (A V 329--32).



[127.] Still, though this is so, they can be brought to mind by
an ordinary man too, if he possesses the special qualities of purified
virtue, and the rest. \[228\] For when he is recollecting the special
qualities of the Buddha, etc., even only according to hearsay, his
consciousness settles down, by virtue of which the hindrances are
suppressed. In his supreme gladness he initiates insight, and



[]



[]



he even attains to Arahantship, like the Elder Phussadeva who dwelt at
Kaṭakandhakāra.



[128.] That venerable one, it seems, saw a figure of the
Enlightened One created by Māra. He thought, "How good this appears
despite its having greed, hate and delusion! What can the Blessed One's
goodness have been like? For he was quite without greed, hate and
delusion!" He acquired happiness with the Blessed One as object, and by
augmenting his insight he reached Arahantship.



The seventh chapter called "The Description of Six Recollections" in the
Treatise on the Development of\
Concentration in the *Path of Purification* composed for the purpose of
gladdening good people.

## CHAPTER VIII 


OTHER RECOLLECTIONS AS MEDITATION SUBJECTS



(*Anussati-kammaṭṭhāna-niddesa*)



\[(7) MINDFULNESS OF DEATH\]



[1.]\[229\] Now comes the description of the development of
mindfulness of death, which was listed next (III.105).



\[Definitions\]



Herein, *death* (*maraṇa*) is the interruption of the life faculty
included within \[the limits of\] a single becoming (existence). But
death as termination (cutting off), in other words, the Arahant's
termination of the suffering of the round, is not intended here, nor is
momentary death, in other words, the momentary dissolution of
formations, nor the "death" of conventional (metaphorical) usage in such
expressions as "dead tree," "dead metal," and so on.



[2.]As intended here it is of two kinds, that is to say, timely
death and untimely death. Herein, *timely death* comes about with the
exhaustion of merit or with the exhaustion of a life span or with both.
*Untimely death* comes about through kamma that interrupts \[other,
life-producing\] kamma.



[3.]Herein, death through *exhaustion of merit* is a term for
the kind of death that comes about owing to the result of \[former\]
rebirth-producing kamma's having finished ripening although favourable
conditions for prolonging the continuity of a life span may be still
present. Death through *exhaustion of a life span* is a term for the
kind of death that comes about owing to the exhaustion of the normal
life span of men of today, which measures only a century owing to want
of such excellence in destiny \[as deities have\] or in time \[as there
is at the beginning of an aeon\] or in nutriment \[as the Uttarakurus
and so on have\].1 *Untimely death* is a term for the death of those
whose continuity is interrupted by kamma capable of causing them to fall
(*cāvana*) from their place at that very moment, as in the case of
Dūsi-Māra (see M I 337), Kalāburājā (see J-a III 39), etc.,2 or for the
death of those whose \[life's\] continuity is interrupted by assaults
with weapons, etc., due to previous kamma. \[230\] All these are
included under the interruption of



1\. Amplifications are from Vism-mhṭ, p. 236.\



2\. "The word 'etc.' includes Nanda-yakkha, Nanda-māṇava, and others"
(Vism-mhṭ 236). See A-a II 104, and M-a IV 8.


[]



[]



the life faculty of the kinds already stated. So mindfulness of death is
the remembering of death, in other words, of the interruption of the
life faculty.



\[Development\]



[4.]One who wants to develop this should go into solitary
retreat and exercise attention wisely in this way: "Death will take
place; the life faculty will be interrupted," or "Death, death."



[5.]If he exercises his attention unwisely in recollecting the
\[possible\] death of an agreeable person, sorrow arises, as in a mother
on recollecting the death of her beloved child she bore; and gladness
arises in recollecting the death of a disagreeable person, as in enemies
on recollecting the death of their enemies; and no sense of urgency
arises on recollecting the death of neutral people, as happens in a
corpse-burner on seeing a dead body; and anxiety arises on recollecting
one's own death, as happens in a timid person on seeing a murderer with
a poised dagger.



[6.]In all that there is neither mindfulness nor sense of
urgency nor knowledge. So he should look here and there at beings that
have been killed or have died, and advert to the death of beings already
dead but formerly seen enjoying good things, doing so with mindfulness,
with a sense of urgency and with knowledge, after which he can exercise
his attention in the way beginning, "Death will take place." By so doing
he exercises it wisely. He exercises it as a \[right\] means, is the
meaning.3



[7.]When some exercise it merely in this way, their hindrances
get suppressed, their mindfulness becomes established with death as its
object, and the meditation subject reaches access.



\[Eight Ways of Recollecting Death\]



[8.]But one who finds that it does not get so far should do his
recollecting of death in eight ways, that is to say: (1) as having the
appearance of a murderer, (2) as the ruin of success, (3) by comparison,
(4) as to sharing the body with many, (5) as to the frailty of life, (6)
as signless, (7) as to the limitedness of the extent, (8) as to the
shortness of the moment.



[9.] Herein, *as having the appearance of a
murderer*: he should do his recollecting thus, "Just as a murderer
appears with a sword, thinking, 'I shall cut this man's head off,' and
applies it to his neck, so death appears." Why? Because it comes with
birth and it takes away life.



[10.]As budding toadstools always come up lifting dust on their
tops, so beings are born along with aging and death. For accordingly
their rebirth-linking consciousness reaches aging immediately next to
its arising and then breaks up together with its associated aggregates,
like a stone that falls from the summit of a rock. \[231\] So to begin
with, momentary death comes along with birth. But death is inevitable
for what is born; consequently the kind of death intended here also
comes along with birth.



3\. For the expression *upāya-manasikāra---*"attention as a \[right\]
means" see M-a I 64.



[]



[]



[11.] Therefore, just as the risen sun moves on towards its
setting and never turns back even for a little while from wherever it
has got to, or just as a mountain torrent sweeps by with a rapid
current, ever flowing and rushing on and never turning back even for a
little while, so too this living being travels on towards death from the
time when he is born, and he never turns back even for a little while.
Hence it is said:



"Right from the very day a man\
Has been conceived inside a womb\
He cannot but go on and on,\
Nor going can he once turn back" (J-a IV 494).



[12.] And whilst he goes on thus death is as near to him as
drying up is to rivulets in the summer heat, as falling is to the fruits
of trees when the sap reaches their attachments in the morning, as
breaking is to clay pots tapped by a mallet, as vanishing is to dewdrops
touched by the sun's rays. Hence it is said:



"The nights and days go slipping by\
As life keeps dwindling steadily\
Till mortals' span, like water pools\
In failing rills, is all used up" (S I 109).



"As there is fear, when fruits are ripe,\
That in the morning they will fall,\
So mortals are in constant fear,\
When they are born, that they will die.\
And as the fate of pots of clay\
Once fashioned by the potter's hand,\
Or small or big or baked or raw,4\
Condemns them to be broken up,\
So mortals' life leads but to death" (Sn p. 576f.).



"The dewdrop on the blade of grass\
Vanishes when the sun comes up;\
Such is a human span of life;\
So, mother, do not hinder me" (J-a IV 122).



[13.]So this death, which comes along with birth, is like a
murderer with poised sword. And like the murderer who applies the sword
to the neck, it carries off life and never returns to bring it back.
\[232\] That is why, since death appears like a murderer with poised
sword owing to its coming along with birth and carrying off life, it
should be recollected as "having the appearance of a murderer."



[14.] *2. As the ruin of success*: here success shines as long
as failure does not overcome it. And the success does not exist that
might endure out of reach of failure. Accordingly:



"He gave with joy a hundred millions\
After conquering all the earth,\
Till in the end his realm came down



4\. This line is not in the Sutta-nipāta, but see D II 120, note.



[]



[]



To less than half a gall-nut's worth.\
Yet when his merit was used up,\
His body breathing its last breath,\
The Sorrowless Asoka too5\
Felt sorrow face to face with death."



[15.] Furthermore, all health ends in sickness, all youth ends
in aging, all life ends in death; all worldly existence is procured by
birth, haunted by aging, surprised by sickness, and struck down by
death. Hence it is said:



"As though huge mountains made of rock\
So vast they reached up to the sky\
Were to advance from every side,\
Grinding beneath them all that lives,\
So age and death roll over all,\
Warriors, priests, merchants, and craftsmen,\
The outcastes and the scavengers,\
Crushing all beings, sparing none.\
And here no troops of elephants,\
No charioteers, no infantry,\
No strategy in form of spells,\
No riches, serve to beat them off" (S I 102).



This is how death should be recollected as the "ruin of success" by
defining



it as death's final ruining of life's success.



[16.] *3.*  *By comparison*: by comparing oneself to others.
Herein, death should be recollected by comparison in seven ways, that is
to say: with those of great fame, with those of great merit, with those
of great strength, with those of great supernormal power, with those of
great understanding, with Paccekabuddhas, with fully enlightened
Buddhas. How? \[233\]



[17.] Although Mahāsammata, Mandhātu, Mahāsudassana, Daḷhanemi,
Nimi,6 etc.,7 were greatly famous and had a great following, and though
they had amassed enormous wealth, yet death inevitably caught up with
them at length, so how shall it not at length overtake me?



Great kings like Mahāsammata,\
Whose fame did spread so mightily,\
All fell into death's power too;\
What can be said of those like me?



5\. The Emperor Asoka is referred to. His name Asoka means "Sorrowless."
This story is in the *Asokāvadāna* and *Divyāvadāna*, pp. 429--434.



6\. The references for the names here and in the following paragraphs
are: Mahāsammata (J-a III 454; II 311), Mandhātu (J-a II 311),
Mahāsudassana (D II 169f.), Daḷhanemi (D III 59f.), Nimi (J-a VI 96f.),
Jotika (Vism XII.41), Jaṭila (XII.41), Ugga (A-a I 394), Meṇḍaka
(XII.41f.), Puṇṇaka (XII.42), Vāsudeva (J-a IV 81f.), Baladeva (J-a IV

7\. *Pabhuti---*"etc.": this meaning is not in PED; see §121.



[]

It should be recollected in this way, firstly, by comparison *with those
of great*



*fame*.



[18.]How by comparison with those of great merit?



Jotika, Jaṭila, Ugga,\
And Meṇḍaka, and Puṇṇaka\
These, the world said, and others too,\
Did live most meritoriously;\
Yet they came one and all to death;\
What can be said of those like me?



It should be recollected in this way by comparison with those of great
merit.



[19.]How by comparison with those of great strength?



Vāsudeva, Baladeva,\
Bhīmasena, Yuddhiṭṭhila,\
And Cāṇura the wrestler,\
Were in the Exterminator's power.\
Throughout the world they were renowned\
As blessed with strength so mighty;\
They too went to the realm of death;\
What can be said of those like me?



It should be recollected in this way by comparison with those of great
strength.



[20.]How by comparison with those of great supernormal power?



The second of the chief disciples,\
The foremost in miraculous powers,\
Who with the point of his great toe\
Did rock Vejayanta's Palace towers,\
Like a deer in a lion's jaw, he too,\
Despite miraculous potency,\
Fell in the dreadful jaws of death;\
What can be said of those like me?



It should be recollected in this way by comparison with those of great



supernormal power.



[21.]How by comparison with those of great understanding?
\[234\]



The first of the two chief disciples\
Did so excel in wisdom's art\
That, save the Helper of the World,\
No being is worth his sixteenth part.\
But though so great was Sāriputta's\
Understanding faculty,\
He fell into death's power too;\
What can be said of those like me?



It should be recollected in this way by comparison with those of great



understanding.



[]



[]



[22.]How by comparison *with Paccekabuddhas*? Even those who by
the strength of their own knowledge and energy crushed all the enemy
defilements and reached enlightenment for themselves, who \[stood
alone\] like the horn of the rhinoceros (see Sn p. 35f.), who were
self-perfected, were still not free from death. So how should I be free
from it?



To help them in their search for truth\
The Sages various signs employed,\
Their knowledge brought them self-perfection,\
Their cankers were at length destroyed.



Like the rhinoceros's horn\
They lived alone in constancy,\
But death they could no way evade;\
What can be said of those like me?



It should be recollected in this way by comparison with Paccekabuddhas.



[23.]How by comparison *with fully enlightened Buddhas*? Even
the Blessed One, whose material body was embellished with the eighty
lesser details and adorned with the thirty-two marks of a great man (see
MN 91; DN 30), whose Dhamma body brought to perfection the treasured
qualities of the aggregates of virtue, etc.,8 made pure in every aspect,
who overpassed greatness of fame, greatness of merit, greatness of
strength, greatness of supernormal power and greatness of understanding,
who had no equal, who was the equal of those without equal, without
double, accomplished and fully enlightened---even he was suddenly
quenched by the downpour of death's rain, as a great mass of fire is
quenched by the downpour of a rain of water.



And so the Greatest Sage possessed\
Such mighty power in every way,\
And it was not through fear or guilt\
That over him Death held his sway.



No being, not even one without\
Guilt or pusillanimity,\
But will be smitten down; so how I\
Will he not conquer those like me?



It should be recollected in this way by comparison with fully
enlightened Buddhas.



[24.] When he does his recollecting in this way by comparing
himself with others possessed of such great fame, etc., in the light of
the universality of death, thinking, "Death will come to me even as it
did to those distinguished beings," then his meditation subject reaches
access. This is how death should be recollected by comparison. \[235\]



[25.] *4.* *As to the sharing of the body with many*: this body
is shared by many. Firstly,



it is shared by the eighty families of worms. There too, creatures live
in dependence



8\. Virtue, concentration, understanding, deliverance, knowledge, and
vision of deliverance.



[]



[]



on the outer skin, feeding on the outer skin; creatures live in
dependence on the inner skin, feeding on the inner skin; creatures live
in dependence on the flesh, feeding on the flesh; creatures live in
dependence on the sinews, feeding on the sinews; creatures live in
dependence on the bones, feeding on the bones; and creatures live in
dependence on the marrow, feeding on the marrow. And there they are
born, grow old and die, evacuate, and make water; and the body is their
maternity home, their hospital, their charnel-ground, their privy and
their urinal. The body can also be brought to death with the upsetting
of these worms. And just as it is shared with the eighty families of
worms, so too it is shared by the several hundred internal diseases, as
well as by such external causes of death as snakes, scorpions, and what
not.



[26.]And just as when a target is set up at a crossroads and
then arrows, spears, pikes, stones, etc., come from all directions and
fall upon it, so too all kinds of accidents befall the body, and it also
comes to death through these accidents befalling it. Hence the Blessed
One said: "Here, bhikkhus, when day is departing and night is drawing
on,9 a bhikkhu considers thus: 'In many ways I can risk death. A snake
may bite me, or a scorpion may sting me, or a centipede may sting me. I
might die of that, and that would set me back. Or I might stumble and
fall, or the food I have eaten might disagree with me, or my bile might
get upset, or my phlegm might get upset \[and sever my joints as it
were\] like knives. I might die of that, and that would set me back'" (A
III 306).



That is how death should be recollected as to sharing the body with
many.



[27.] *5.* *As to the frailty of life*: this life is impotent
and frail. For the life of beings is bound up with breathing, it is
bound up with the postures, it is bound up with cold and heat, it is
bound up with the primary elements, and it is bound up with nutriment.



[28.] Life occurs only when the in-breaths and out-breaths
occur evenly. But when the wind in the nostrils that has gone outside
does not go in again, or when that which has gone inside does not come
out again, then a man is reckoned to be dead.



And it occurs only when the four postures are found occurring evenly.
\[236\]



But with the prevailing of anyone of them the life process is
interrupted.



And it occurs only when cold and heat are found occurring evenly. But it
fails



when a man is overcome by excessive cold or heat.



And it occurs only when the four primary elements are found occurring
evenly. But with the disturbance of the earth element even a strong
man's life can be terminated if his body becomes rigid, or with the
disturbance of one of the elements beginning with water if his body
becomes flaccid and petrified with a flux of the bowels, etc., or if he
is consumed by a bad fever, or if he suffers a severing of his
limb-joint ligatures (cf. XI.102).

And life occurs only in one who gets physical nutriment at the proper
time;



but if he gets none, he uses his life up.



This is how death should be recollected as to the frailty of life.



[29.] *6.* *As signless*: as indefinable. The meaning is that
it is unpredictable. For in the case of all beings:



The span, the sickness, and the time, and where\
The body will be laid, the destiny:\
The living world can never know10 these things;\
There is no sign foretells when they will be.



[30.]Herein, firstly *the span* has no sign because there is no
definition such as: Just so much must be lived, no more than that. For
beings \[die in the various stages of the embryo, namely\], at the time
of the *kalala*, of the *abbuda*, of the *pesi*, of the *ghana*, at one
month gone, two months gone, three months gone, four months gone, five
months gone ... ten months gone, and on the occasion of coming out of
the womb. And after that they die this side or the other of the century.



[31.]And *the sickness* has no sign because there is no
definition such as: Beings die only of this sickness, not of any other.
For beings die of eye disease or of any one among those beginning with
ear disease (see A V 110).



[32.]And *the time* has no sign because there is no definition
such as: One has to die only at this time, not at any other. For beings
die in the morning and at any of the other times such as noon.



[33.] And  *where the body will be laid down* has no sign
because there is no definition such as: When people die, they must drop
their bodies only here, not anywhere else. For the person of those born
inside a village is dropped outside the village, and that of those born
outside the village is dropped inside it. Likewise that of those born in
water is dropped on land, and that of those born on land in water. And
this can be multiplied in many ways. \[237\]



[34.]And  *the destiny* has no sign because there is no
definition such as: One who dies there must be reborn here. For there
are some who die in a divine world and are reborn in the human world,
and there are some who die in the human world and are reborn in a divine
world, and so on. And in this way the world goes round and round the
five kinds of destinies like an ox harnessed to a machine.



This is how death should be recollected as signless.



[35.] *7.* *As to the limitedness of the extent*: the extent of
human life is short now. One who lives long lives a hundred years, more
or less. Hence the Blessed One said: "Bhikkhus, this human life span is
short. There is a new life to be gone to, there are profitable \[deeds\]
to be done, there is the life of purity to be led. There is no not dying
for the born. He who lives long lives a hundred years, more or less ..."



"The life of humankind is short;\
A wise man holds it in contempt\
And acts as one whose head is burning;\
Death will never fail to come" (S I 108).

Other Recollections as Meditation Subjects

And he said further: "Bhikkhus, there was once a teacher called Araka
..." (A



IV 136), all of which sutta should be given in full, adorned as it is
with seven similes.



[36.]And he said further: "Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu develops
mindfulness of death thus, 'Oh, let me live a night and day that I may
attend to the Blessed One's teaching, surely much could be done by me,'
and when a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of death thus, 'Oh, let me live
a day that I may attend to the Blessed One's teaching, surely much could
be done by me,' and when a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of death thus,
'Oh, let me live as long as it takes to chew and swallow four or five
mouthfuls that I may attend to the Blessed One's teaching, surely much
could be done by me'---these are called bhikkhus who dwell in negligence
and slackly develop mindfulness of death for the destruction of cankers.
\[238\]



37\. "And, bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of death thus,



'Oh, let me live for as long as it takes to chew and swallow a single
mouthful that I may attend to the Blessed One's teaching, surely much
could be done by me,' and when a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of death
thus, 'Oh, let me live as long as it takes to breathe in and breathe
out, or as long as it takes to breathe out and breathe in, that I may
attend to the Blessed One's teaching, surely much could be done by
me'---these are called bhikkhus who dwell in diligence and keenly
develop mindfulness of death for the destruction of cankers" (A III
305--6).



[38.]So short in fact is the extent of life that it is not
certain even for as long as it takes to chew and swallow four or five
mouthfuls.



This is how death should be recollected as to the limitedness of the
extent. 39.



*8.* *As to the shortness of the moment*: in the ultimate sense the
life-moment of living beings is extremely short, being only as much as
the occurrence of a single conscious moment. Just as a chariot wheel,
when it is rolling, rolls \[that is, touches the ground\] only on one
point of \[the circumference of\] its tire, and, when it is at rest,
rests only on one point, so too, the life of living beings lasts only
for a single conscious moment. When that consciousness has ceased, the
being is said to have ceased, according as it is said: "In a past
conscious moment he did live, not he does live, not he will live. In a
future conscious moment not he did live, not he does live, he will live.
In the present conscious moment not he did live, he does live, not he
will live."



"Life, person, pleasure, pain---just these alone\
Join in one conscious moment that flicks by.\
Ceased aggregates of those dead or alive\
Are all alike, gone never to return.



No \[world is\] born if \[consciousness is\] not\
Produced; when that is present, then it lives;\
When consciousness dissolves, the world is dead:\
The highest sense this concept will allow"11 (Nidd I 42).



11\. "'Person' (*atta-bhāva*) is the states other than the
already-mentioned life, feeling and consciousness. The words '*just
these alone*' mean that it is unmixed with self (*attā*)

or permanence" (Vism-mhṭ 242). *Atta-bhāva* as used in the Suttas and in
this work is more or less a synonym for *sakkāya* in the sense of person
(body and mind) or personality, or individual form. See Piṭaka refs. in
PED and e.g. this chapter §35 and XI.54.\
"'*When consciousness dissolves, the world is dead*": just as in the
case of the death- consciousness, this world is also called 'dead' in
the highest (ultimate) sense with the arrival of any consciousness
whatever at its dissolution, since its cessation has no rebirth-linking
(is 'cessation never to return'). Nevertheless, though this is so, '*the
highest sense this concept will allow*  (*paññatti paramatthiyā*)'---the
ultimate sense will allow this concept of continuity, which is what the
expression of common usage 'Tissa lives, Phussa lives' refers to, and
which is based on consciousnesses \[momentarily\] existing along with a
physical support; this belongs to the ultimate sense here, since, as
they say, 'It is not the name and surname that lives.'" (Vism-mhṭ 242,
801) Something may be said about the word *paññatti* here. Twenty-four
kinds are dealt with in the commentary to the Puggalapaññatti. The
Puggalapaññatti Schedule (*mātikā*) gives the following six *paññatti*
(here a making known, a setting out): of aggregates, bases, elements,
truths, faculties, and persons. (Pug 1) The commentary explains the word
in this sense as *paññāpana* (making known) and *ṭhapana* (placing),
quoting "He announces, teaches, declares (*paññāpeti*), establishes"
(cf. M III 248), and also "a well- appointed (*supaññatta*) bed and
chair" (?). It continues: "The making known of a name (*nāma-paññatti*)
shows such and such dhammas and places them in such and such
compartments, while the making known of the aggregates
(*khandha-paññatti*) and the rest shows in brief the individual form of
those making-known (*paññatti*)." It then gives six kinds of *paññatti*
"according to the commentarial method but not in the texts": (1)
*Concept of the existent* (*vijjamāna-paññatti*), which is the
conceptualizing of (making known) a dhamma that is existent, actual,
become, in the true and ultimate sense (e.g. aggregates, etc.). (2)
*Concept of the non-existent*, which is, for example, the
conceptualizing of "female," "male," "persons," etc., which are
non-existent by that standard and are only established by means of
current speech in the world; similarly "such impossibilities as concepts
of a fifth truth or the other sectarians' Atom, Primordial Essence,
World Soul, and the like." (3) *Concept of the non-existent based on the
existent*, e.g. the expression, "One with the three clear-visions,"
where the "person" ("one") is nonexistent and the "clear-visions" are
existent. (4) *Concept of the existent based on the non-existent*, e.g.
the "female form," "visible form" (= visible datum base)\
being existent and "female" non-existent. (5) *Concept of the existent*
based on the existent, e.g. "eye-contact," both "eye" and "contact"
being existent. (6) *Concept of the non-existent based on the
non-existent*, e.g. "banker's son," both being non-existent. Again two
more sets of six are given as "according to the Teachers, but not in the
Commentaries." The first is: (1) *Derivative concept*
(*upādā-paññatti*); this, for instance, is a "being," which is a
convention derived from the aggregates of materiality, feeling, etc.,
though it has no individual essence of its own apprehendable in the true
ultimate sense, as materiality, say, has in its self-identity and its
otherness from feeling, etc.; or a "house" or a "fist" or an "oven" as
apart from its component parts, or a "pitcher" or a "garment," which are
all derived from those same aggregates; or "time" or "direction," which
are derived from the revolutions of the moon and sun; or the "learning
sign" or "counterpart sign" founded on some aspect or other, which are a
convention derived from some real sign as a benefit of meditative
development: these are derived concepts, and this kind is a "concept"
(*paññatti*) in the sense of "ability to



[]

This is how death should be recollected as to the shortness of the
moment.



\[Conclusion\]



[40.]So while he does his recollecting by means of one or other
of these eight ways, his consciousness acquires \[the support of\]
repetition owing to the reiterated attention, mindfulness settles down
with death as its object, the hindrances are suppressed, and the jhāna
factors make their appearance. But since the object is stated with
individual essences,12 and since it awakens a sense of urgency, the
jhāna does not reach absorption and is only access. \[239\] Now, with
special development, the supramundane jhāna and the second and the
fourth immaterial jhānas reach absorption even with respect to states
with individual essences. For the supramundane reaches absorption by
means of



be set up" (*paññāpetabba* = ability to be conceptualized), but not in
the sense of "making known" (*paññāpana*). Under the latter heading this
would be a "concept of the nonexistent." (2) *Appositional concept*
(*upa-nidhā-p*.): many varieties are listed, namely, apposition of
reference ("second" as against "first," "third" as against "second,"
"long" as against "short"); apposition of what is in the hand
("umbrella-in-hand," "knife-in-hand"); apposition of association
("earring-wearer," "topknot-wearer," "crest-wearer"); apposition of
contents ("corn-wagon," "ghee-pot"); apposition of proximity ("Indasālā
Cave," "Piyaṅgu Cave"); apposition of comparison ("golden coloured,"
"with a bull's gait"); apposition of majority ("Padumassara-brahman
Village"); apposition of distinction ("diamond ring"); and so on. (3)
*Collective concept* (*samodhāna-p*.), e.g., "eight-footed," "pile of
riches." (4) *Additive concept* (*upanikkhitta- p*.), e.g. "one," "two,"
"three." (5) *Verisimilar concept* (*tajjā-p*.): refers to the
individual essence of a given dhamma, e.g. "earth," "fire," "hardness,"
"heat." (6) *Continuity concept*  (*santati-p*.): refers to the length
of continuity of life, e.g. "octogenarian," "nonagenarian."\
In the second set there are: (i) *Concept according to function*
(*kicca-p*.), e.g. "preacher," "expounder of Dhamma." (ii) *Concept
according to shape* (*saṇṭhāna-p.*), e.g. "thin," "stout," "round,"
"square." (iii) *Concept according to gender* (*liṅga-p*.), e.g.
"female," "male." (iv) *Concept according to location* (*bhūmi-p*.),
e.g. "of the sense sphere," "Kosalan." (v) *Concept as proper name*
(*paccatta-p*.), e.g. "Tissa," "Nāga," "Sumana," which are making-known
(appellations) by mere name-making. (vi) *Concept of the unformed*
(*asaṅkhata-paññatti*), e.g. "cessation," "Nibbāna," etc., which make
the unformed dhamma known---an existent concept. (From commentary to
*Puggalapaññatti*, condensed---see also Dhs-a 390f.)\
All this shows that the word *paññatti* carries the meanings of either
appellation or concept or both together, and that no English word quite
corresponds.



12\. "'But since the object is stated with individual essences': the
breakup of states with individual essences, their destruction, their
fall---\[all\] that has to do only with states with individual essences.
Hence the Blessed One said: 'Bhikkhus, aging-and- death is impermanent,
formed, dependently arisen' (S II 26). ... If it cannot reach absorption
because of \[its object being\] states with individual essences then
what about the supramundane jhānas and certain of the immaterial jhānas?
It was to answer this that he said 'now with special development the
supramundane jhāna' and so on" (Vism-mhṭ 243). Kasiṇa jhāna, for
example, has a concept (*paññatti*) as its object (IV.29) and a concept
is a dhamma without individual essence (*asabhāva-dhamma*).

progressive development of the purification and the immaterial jhānas do
so by means of development consisting in the surmounting of the object
(see Ch. X) since there \[in those two immaterial jhānas\] there is
merely the surmounting of the object of jhāna that had already reached
absorption. But here \[in mundane mindfulness of death\] there is
neither so the jhāna only reaches access. And that access is known as
"mindfulness of death" too since it arises through its means.



[41.] A bhikkhu devoted to mindfulness of death is constantly
diligent. He acquires perception of disenchantment with all kinds of
becoming (existence). He conquers attachment to life. He condemns evil.
He avoids much storing. He has no stain of avarice about requisites.
Perception of impermanence grows in him, following upon which there
appear the perceptions of pain and not-self. But while beings who have
not developed \[mindfulness of\] death fall victims to fear, horror and
confusion at the time of death as though suddenly seized by wild beasts,
spirits, snakes, robbers, or murderers, he dies undeluded and fearless
without falling into any such state. And if he does not attain the
deathless here and now, he is at least headed for a happy destiny on the
breakup of the body.



Now, when a man is truly wise,\
His constant task will surely be\
This recollection about death\
Blessed with such mighty potency.



This is the section dealing with the recollection of death in the
detailed



explanation.



\[(8) MINDFULNESS OCCUPIED WITH THE BODY\]



[42.] Now comes the description of the development of
mindfulness occupied with the body as a meditation subject, which is
never promulgated except after an Enlightened One's arising, and is
outside the province of any sectarians. It has been commended by the
Blessed One in various ways in different suttas thus: "Bhikkhus, when
one thing is developed and repeatedly practiced, it leads to a supreme
sense of urgency, to supreme benefit, to supreme surcease of bondage, to
supreme mindfulness and full awareness, to acquisition of knowledge and
vision, to a happy life here and now, to realization of the fruit of
clear vision and deliverance. What is that one thing? It is mindfulness
occupied with the body" (A I 43). And thus: "Bhikkhus, they savour the
deathless who savour mindfulness occupied with the body; they do not
savour the deathless who do not savour mindfulness occupied with the
body.13 \[240\] They have savoured the deathless who have savoured
mindfulness occupied with the body; they have not savoured ... They have
neglected ... they have not neglected ... They have missed ... they have
found the deathless who have found mindfulness occupied with the body"
(A I 45). And it has been described in fourteen sections in the passage
beginning, "And how developed, bhikkhus, how repeatedly practiced is
mindfulness occupied with the body of great fruit, of great benefit?
Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, gone to the forest ..." (M III 89), that is
to say, the sections on breathing, on

opposite order.

postures, on the four kinds of full awareness, on attention directed to
repulsiveness, on attention directed to elements, and on the nine
charnel-ground contemplations.



[43.]Herein, the three, that is to say, the sections on
postures, on the four kinds of full awareness (see M-a I 253f.), and on
attention directed to elements, as they are stated \[in that sutta\],
deal with insight. Then the nine sections on the charnel- ground
contemplations, as stated there, deal with that particular phase of
insight knowledge called contemplation of danger. And any development of
concentration in the bloated, etc., that might be implied there has
already been explained in the Description of Foulness (Ch. VI). So there
are only the two, that is, the sections on breathing and on directing
attention to repulsiveness, that, as stated there, deal with
concentration. Of these two, the section on breathing is a separate
meditation subject, namely, mindfulness of breathing.



\[Text\]



[44.]What is intended here as mindfulness occupied with the
body is the thirty- two aspects. This meditation subject is taught as
the direction of attention to repulsiveness thus: "Again, bhikkhus, a
bhikkhu reviews this body, up from the soles of the feet and down from
the top of the hair and contained in the skin, as full of many kinds of
filth thus: In this body there are head hairs, body hairs, nails, teeth,
skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidney, heart, liver, midriff,
spleen, lungs, bowels, entrails, gorge, dung, bile, phlegm, pus, blood,
sweat, fat, tears, grease, spittle, snot, oil of the joints, and urine"
(M III 90), the brain being included in the bone marrow in this version
\[with a total of only thirty-one aspects\].



[45.]Here is the description of the development introduced by a
commentary on the text.



\[Word Commentary\]



*This body*: this filthy body constructed out of the four primary
elements. *Up from the soles of the feet*: from the soles of the feet
upwards. *Down from the top of the hair*: from the highest part of the
hair downwards. *Contained in the skin*: terminated all round by the
skin. *Reviews ... as full of many kinds of filth*: \[241\] he sees that
this body is packed with the filth of various kinds beginning with head
hairs. How? "In this body there are head hairs ... urine."



[46.] Herein, *there are* means, there are found. *In this*: in
this, which is expressed thus: "Up from the soles of the feet and down
from the top of the hair and contained in the skin, as full of many
kinds of filth." *Body*: the carcass; for it is the carcass that is
called "body" (*kāya*) because it is a conglomeration of filth, because
such vile (*kucchita*) things as the head hairs, etc., and the hundred
diseases beginning with eye disease, have it as their origin (*āya*).



*Head hairs, body hairs*: these things beginning with head hairs are the
thirty- two aspects. The construction here should be understood in this
way: In this body there are head hairs, in this body there are body
hairs.



[]



[]



[47.] No one who searches throughout the whole of this
fathom-long carcass, starting upwards from the soles of the feet,
starting downwards from the top of the head, and starting from the skin
all round, ever finds even the minutest atom at all beautiful in it,
such as a pearl, or a gem, or beryl, or aloes,14 or saffron, or camphor,
or talcum powder; on the contrary he finds nothing but the various very
malodorous, offensive, drab-looking sorts of filth consisting of the
head hairs, body hairs, and the rest. Hence it is said: "In this body
there are head hairs, body hairs ... urine."



This is the commentary on the word-construction here.



\[Development\]



[48.] Now, a clansman who, as a beginner, wants to develop this
meditation subject should go to a good friend of the kind already
described (III.61--73) and learn it. And the teacher who expounds it to
him should tell him the sevenfold skill in learning and the tenfold
skill in giving attention.



\[The Sevenfold Skill in Learning\]



Herein, the sevenfold skill in learning should be told thus: (1) as
verbal recitation, (2) as mental recitation, (3) as to colour, (4) as to
shape, (5) as to direction, (6) as to location, (7) as to delimitation.



[49.] *1.* This meditation subject consists in giving attention
to repulsiveness. Even if one is master of the Tipiṭaka, the *verbal
recitation* should still be done at the time of first giving it
attention. For the meditation subject only becomes evident to some
through recitation, as it did to the two elders who learned the
meditation subject from the Elder Mahā Deva of the Hill Country
(Malaya). On being asked for the meditation subject, it seems, the elder
\[242\] gave the text of the thirty-two aspects, saying, "Do only this
recitation for four months." Although they were familiar respectively
with two and three Piṭakas, it was only at the end of four months of
recitation of the meditation subject that they became stream-enterers,
with right apprehension \[of the text\]. So the teacher who expounds the
meditation subject should tell the pupil to do the recitation verbally
first.



[50.]Now, when he does the recitation, he should divide it up
into the "skin pentad," etc., and do it forwards and backwards. After
saying "Head hairs, body hairs, nails, teeth, skin," he should repeat it
backwards, "Skin, teeth, nails, body hairs, head hairs."



[51.]Next to that, with the "kidney pentad," after saying
"Flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidney," he should repeat it
backwards, "Kidney, bone marrow, bones, sinews, flesh; skin, teeth,
nails, body hairs, head hairs."



[52.]Next, with the "lungs pentad," after saying "Heart, liver,
midriff, spleen, lungs," he should repeat it backwards, "Lungs, spleen,
midriff, liver, heart; kidney, bone marrow, bones, sinews, flesh; skin,
teeth, nails, body hairs, head hairs."



14\. *Agaru---*"aloes": not so spelled in PED; but see *agalu*.



[]



[]



[53.]Next, with the "brain pentad," after saying "Bowels,
entrails, gorge, dung, brain," he should repeat it backwards, "Brain,
dung, gorge, entrails, bowels; lungs, spleen, midriff, liver, heart;
kidney, bone marrow, bones, sinews, flesh; skin, teeth, nails, body
hairs, head hairs."



[54.]Next, with the "fat sextad," after saying "Bile, phlegm,
pus, blood, sweat, fat," he should repeat it backwards, "Fat, sweat,
blood, pus, phlegm, bile; brain, dung, gorge, entrails, bowels; lungs,
spleen, midriff, liver, heart; kidney, bone marrow, bones, sinews,
flesh; skin, teeth, nails, body hairs, head hairs."



[55.]Next, with the "urine sextad," after saying "Tears,
grease, spittle, snot, oil of the joints, urine," he should repeat it
backwards, "Urine, oil of the joints, snot, spittle, grease, tears; fat,
sweat, blood, pus, phlegm, bile; brain, dung, gorge, entrails, bowels;
lungs, spleen, midriff, liver, heart; kidney, bone marrow, bones,
sinews, flesh; skin, teeth, nails, body hairs, head hairs." \[243\]



[56.] The recitation should be done verbally in this way a
hundred times, a thousand times, even a hundred thousand times. For it
is through verbal recitation that the meditation subject becomes
familiar, and the mind being thus prevented from running here and there,
the parts become evident and seem like \[the fingers of\] a pair of
clasped hands,15 like a row of fence posts.



[57.]*2. * The  *mental recitation* should be done just as it
is done verbally. For the verbal recitation is a condition for the
mental recitation, and the mental recitation is a condition for the
penetration of the characteristic \[of foulness\].16



[58.]*3. As to colour*: the colour of the head hairs, etc.,
should be defined.



*4. As to shape*: their shape should be defined too.



*5.* *As to direction*: in this body, upwards from the navel is the
upward direction, and downwards from it is the downward direction. So
the direction should be defined thus: "This part is in this direction."



*6.* *As to location*: the location of this or that part should be
defined thus: "This



part is established in this location."



[59.] *7.* *As to delimitation*: there are two kinds of
delimitation, that is, delimitation of the similar and delimitation of
the dissimilar. Herein, delimitation of the similar should be understood
in this way: "This part is delimited above and below and around by
this." Delimitation of the dissimilar should be understood as
non-intermixed-ness in this way: "Head hairs are not body hairs, and
body hairs are not head hairs."



[60.]When the teacher tells the skill in learning in seven ways
thus, he should do so knowing that in certain suttas this meditation
subject is expounded from the point of view of repulsiveness and in
certain suttas from the point of view of elements. For in the Mahā
Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta (DN 22) it is expounded only as repulsiveness. In the
Mahā Hatthipadopama Sutta (MN 28), in the Mahā



15\. *Hatthasaṅkhalikā---*"the fingers of a pair of clasped hands," "a
row of fingers (*aṅgulīpanti*) (Vism-mhṭ 246).\



16\. "For the penetration of the characteristic of foulness, for the
observation of repulsiveness as the individual essence" (Vism-mhṭ 246).



[]



[]



Rāhulovāda Sutta (MN 62), and the Dhātuvibhaṅga (MN 140, also Vibh 82),
it is expounded as elements. In the Kāyagatāsati Sutta (MN 119),
however, four jhānas are expounded with reference to one to whom it has
appeared as a colour \[kasiṇa\] (see III.107). Herein, it is an insight
meditation subject that is expounded as elements and a serenity
meditation subject that is expounded as repulsiveness. Consequently it
is only the serenity meditation subject \[that is relevant\] here.



\[The Tenfold Skill in Giving Attention\]



[61.]Having thus told the sevenfold skill in learning, he
should tell the tenfold skill in giving attention as follows: (1) as to
following the order, (2) not too quickly, (3) not too slowly (4) as to
warding off distraction, (5) as to surmounting the concept, (6) as to
successive leaving, (7) as to absorption, (8)--(10) as to the three
suttantas.



[62.] *1.* Herein, *as to following the order*: from the time
of beginning the recitation \[244\] attention should be given following
the serial order without skipping. For just as when someone who has no
skill climbs a thirty-two-rung ladder using every other step, his body
gets exhausted and he falls without completing the climb, so too, one
who gives it attention skipping \[parts\] becomes exhausted in his mind
and does not complete the development since he fails to get the
satisfaction that ought to be got with successful development.



[63.] *2.* Also when he gives attention to it following the
serial order, he should do so *not too quickly*. For just as when a man
sets out on a three-league journey, even if he has already done the
journey out and back a hundred times rapidly without taking note of
\[turnings\] to be taken and avoided, though he may finish his journey,
he still has to ask how to get there, so too, when the meditator gives
his attention to the meditation subject too quickly, though he may reach
the end of the meditation subject, it still does not become clear or
bring about any distinction. So he should not give his attention to it
too quickly.



[64.] *3.* And as "not too quickly," so also *not too slowly*.
For just as when a man wants to do a three-league journey in one day, if
he loiters on the way among trees, rocks, pools, etc., he does not
finish the journey in a day and needs two or three to complete it, so
too, if the meditator gives his attention to the meditation subject too
slowly, he does not get to the end and it does not become a condition
for distinction.



[65.]  *As to warding off distraction*: he must
ward off \[temptation\] to drop the meditation subject and to let his
mind get distracted among the variety of external objects. For if not,
just as when a man has entered on a one-foot-wide cliff path, if he
looks about here and there without watching his step, he may miss his
footing and fall down the cliff, which is perhaps as high as a hundred
men, so too, when there is outward distraction, the meditation subject
gets neglected and deteriorates. So he should give his attention to it
warding off distraction.



[66.] *5.* *As to surmounting the concept*: this \[name-\]
concept beginning with "head hairs, body hairs" must be surmounted and
consciousness established on \[the aspect\] "repulsive." For just as
when men find a water hole in a forest in a time



[]



[]



of drought, they hang up some kind of signal there such as a palm leaf,
and people come to bathe and drink guided by the signal, \[245\] but
when the way has become plain with their continual traffic, there is no
further need of the signal and they go to bathe and drink there whenever
they want, so too, when repulsiveness becomes evident to him as he is
giving his attention to the meditation subject through the means of the
\[name-\] concept "head hairs, body hairs," he must surmount the concept
"head hairs, body hairs" and establish consciousness on only the actual
repulsiveness.



[67.] *6.* *As to successive leaving*: in giving his attention
he should eventually leave out any \[parts\] that do not appear to him.
For when a beginner gives his attention to head hairs, his attention
then carries on till it arrives at the last part, that is, urine and
stops there; and when he gives his attention to urine, his attention
then carries on till it arrives back at the first part, that is, head
hairs, and stops there. As he persists in giving his attention thus,
some parts appear to him and others do not. Then he should work on those
that have appeared till one out of any two appears the clearer. He
should arouse absorption by again and again giving attention to the one
that has appeared thus.



[68.]Here is a simile. Suppose a hunter wanted to catch a
monkey that lived in a grove of thirty-two palms, and he shot an arrow
through a leaf of the palm that stood at the beginning and gave a shout;
then the monkey went leaping successively from palm to palm till it
reached the last palm; and when the hunter went there too and did as
before, it came back in like manner to the first palm; and being
followed thus again and again, after leaping from each place where a
shout was given, it eventually jumped on to one palm, and firmly seizing
the palm shoot's leaf spike in the middle, would not leap any more even
when shot---so it is with this.



[69.]The application of the simile is this. The thirty-two
parts of the body are like the thirty-two palms in the grove. The monkey
is like the mind. The meditator is like the hunter. The range of the
meditator's mind in the body with its thirty-two parts as object is like
the monkey's inhabiting the palm grove of thirty-two palms. The settling
down of the meditator's mind in the last part after going successively
\[from part to part\] when he began by giving his attention to head
hairs is like the monkey's leaping from palm to palm and going to the
last palm, \[246\] when the hunter shot an arrow through the leaf of the
palm where it was and gave a shout. Likewise in the return to the
beginning. His doing the preliminary work on those parts that have
appeared, leaving behind those that did not appear while, as he gave his
attention to them again and again, some appeared to him and some did
not, is like the monkey's being followed and leaping up from each place
where a shout is given. The meditator's repeated attention given to the
part that in the end appears the more clearly of any two that have
appeared to him and his finally reaching absorption, is like the
monkey's eventually stopping in one palm, firmly seizing the palm
shoot's leaf spike in the middle and not leaping up even when shot.



[70.] There is another simile too. Suppose an alms-food-eater
bhikkhu went to live near a village of thirty-two families, and when he
got two lots of alms at the first house he left out one \[house\] beyond
it, and next day, when he got three lots



[]



[]



of \[alms at the first house\] he left out two \[houses\] beyond it, and
on the third day he got his bowl full at the first \[house\], and went
to the sitting hall and ate---so it is with this.



[71.]The thirty-two aspects are like the village with the
thirty-two families. The meditator is like the alms-food eater. The
meditator's preliminary work is like the alms-food eater's going to live
near the village. The meditator's continuing to give attention after
leaving out those parts that do not appear and doing his preliminary
work on the pair of parts that do appear is like the alms-food eater's
getting two lots of alms at the first house and leaving out one
\[house\] beyond it, and like his next day getting three \[lots of alms
at the first house\] and leaving out two \[houses\] beyond it. The
arousing of absorption by giving attention again and again to that which
has appeared the more clearly of two is like the alms-food eater's
getting his bowl full at the first \[house\] on the third day and then
going to the sitting hall and eating.



[72.] *7.* *As to absorption*: as to absorption part by part.
The intention here is this: it should be understood that absorption is
brought about in each one of the parts.



[73.] *8--10.*  *As to the three suttantas*: the intention here
is this: it should be understood that the three suttantas, namely, those
on higher consciousness,17 on coolness, and on skill in the
enlightenment factors, have as their purpose the linking of energy with
concentration.



[74.] *8. * Herein, this sutta should be understood to deal
with higher consciousness: "Bhikkhus, there are three signs that should
be given attention from time to time by a bhikkhu intent on higher
consciousness. The sign of concentration should be given attention from
time to time, the sign of exertion should be given attention from time
to time, the sign of equanimity should be given attention from time to
time. \[247\] If a bhikkhu intent on higher consciousness gives
attention only to the sign of concentration, then his consciousness may
conduce to idleness. If a bhikkhu intent on higher consciousness gives
attention only to the sign of exertion, then his consciousness may
conduce to agitation. If a bhikkhu intent on higher consciousness gives
attention only to the sign of equanimity, then his consciousness may not
become rightly concentrated for the destruction of cankers. But,
bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu intent on higher consciousness gives attention
from time to time to the sign of concentration ... to the sign of
exertion ... to the sign of equanimity, then his consciousness becomes
malleable, wieldy and bright, it is not brittle and becomes rightly
concentrated for the destruction of cankers.



[75.]"Bhikkhus, just as a skilled goldsmith or goldsmith's
apprentice prepares his furnace and heats it up and puts crude gold into
it with tongs; and he blows on it from time to time, sprinkles water on
it from time to time, and looks on at it from time to time; and if the
goldsmith or goldsmith's apprentice only blew on the crude gold, it
would burn and if he only sprinkled water on it, it would cool down, and
if he only looked on at it, it would not get rightly refined; but, when



17\. "The higher consciousness" is a term for jhāna.



[]



[]



the goldsmith or goldsmith's apprentice blows on the crude gold from
time to time, sprinkles water on it from time to time, and looks on at
it from time to time, then it becomes malleable, wieldy and bright, it
is not brittle, and it submits rightly to being wrought; whatever kind
of ornament he wants to work it into, whether a chain or a ring or a
necklace or a gold fillet, it serves his purpose.



[76.]"So too, bhikkhus, there are three signs that should be
given attention from time to time by a bhikkhu intent on higher
consciousness ... becomes rightly concentrated for the destruction of
cankers. \[248\] He attains the ability to be a witness, through
realization by direct-knowledge, of any state realizable by
direct-knowledge to which he inclines his mind, whenever there is
occasion" (A I 256--58).18



[77.] *9.* This sutta deals with coolness: "Bhikkhus, when a
bhikkhu possesses six things, he is able to realize the supreme
coolness. What six? Here, bhikkhus, when consciousness should be
restrained, he restrains it; when consciousness should be exerted, he
exerts it; when consciousness should be encouraged, he encourages it;
when consciousness should be looked on at with equanimity, he looks on
at it with equanimity. He is resolute on the superior \[state to be
attained\], he delights in Nibbāna. Possessing these six things a
bhikkhu is able to realize the supreme coolness" (A III 435).



[78.] *10.* Skill in the enlightenment factors has already been
dealt with in the explanation of skill in absorption (IV.51, 57) in the
passage beginning, "Bhikkhus, when the mind is slack, that is not the
time for developing the tranquillity enlightenment factor ..." (S V
113).



[79.]So the meditator should make sure that he has apprehended
this sevenfold skill in learning well and has properly defined this
tenfold skill in giving attention, thus learning the meditation subject
properly with both kinds of skill.



\[Starting the Practice\]



[80.]If it is convenient for him to live in the same monastery
as the teacher, then he need not get it explained in detail thus \[to
begin with\], but as he applies himself to the meditation subject after
he has made quite sure about it he can have each successive stage
explained as he reaches each distinction.



One who wants to live elsewhere, however, must get it explained to him
in detail in the way already given, and he must turn it over and over,
getting all the difficulties solved. He should leave an abode of an
unsuitable kind as described in the Description of the Earth Kasiṇa, and
go to live in a suitable one. Then he should sever the minor impediments
(IV.20) and set about the preliminary work for giving attention to
repulsiveness.



18\. Vism-mhṭ explains "*sati sati āyatane*" (rendered here by "whenever
there is occasion" with "*tasmiṃ tasmiṃ pubbahetu-ādi-kāraṇe sati*"
("when there is this or that reason consisting in a previous cause,
etc."); M-a IV 146 says: "*Sati sati kāraṇe. Kim pan' ettha kāraṇan'ti.
Abhiññā' va kāraṇaṃ* ('Whenever there is a reason. But what is the
reason here? The direct-knowledge itself is the reason')."

\[The Thirty-two Aspects in Detail\]



[81.] When he sets about it, he should first apprehend the
\[learning\] sign in head hairs. How? The *colour* should be defined
first by plucking out one or two head hairs and placing them on the palm
of the hand. \[249\] He can also look at them in the hair-cutting place,
or in a bowl of water or rice gruel. If the ones he sees are black when
he sees them, they should be brought to mind as "black;" if white, as
"white;" if mixed, they should be brought to mind in accordance with
those most prevalent. And as in the case of head hairs, so too the sign
should be apprehended visually with the whole of the "skin pentad."



[82.]Having apprehended the sign thus and (a) defined all the
other *parts of the body* by colour, shape, direction, location, and
delimitation (§58), he should then (b) define *repulsiveness* in five
ways, that is, by colour, shape, odour, habitat, and location.



[83.]Here is the explanation of all the parts given in
successive order.



\[Head Hairs\]



\(a\) Firstly head hairs are black in their normal *colour*, the colour
of fresh *ariṭṭhaka* seeds.19 As to *shape*, they are the shape of long
round measuring rods.20 As to *direction*, they lie in the upper
direction. As to *location*, their location is the wet inner skin that
envelops the skull; it is bounded on both sides by the roots of the
ears, in front by the forehead, and behind by the nape of the neck.21 As
to *delimitation*, they are bounded below by the surface of their own
roots, which are fixed by entering to the amount of the tip of a rice
grain into the inner skin that envelops the head. They are bounded above
by space, and all round by each other. There are no two hairs together.
This is their delimitation by the similar. Head hairs are not body
hairs, and body hairs are not head hairs; being likewise not intermixed
with the remaining thirty-one parts, the head hairs are a separate part.
This is their delimitation by the dissimilar. Such is the definition of
head hairs as to colour and so on.



[84.](b) Their definition *as to repulsiveness* in the five
ways, that is, by colour, etc., is as follows. Head hairs are repulsive
in colour as well as in shape, odour, habitat, and location.



[85.]For on seeing the colour of a head hair in a bowl of
inviting rice gruel or cooked rice, people are disgusted and say, "This
has got hairs in it. Take it away." So they are repulsive in *colour*.
Also when people are eating at night, they are likewise disgusted by the
mere sensation of a hair-shaped *akka*-bark or *makaci*- bark fibre. So
they are repulsive in *shape*.



[86.] And the *odour* of head hairs, unless dressed with a
smearing of oil, scented



with flowers, etc., is most offensive. And it is still worse when they
are put in the

20\. There are various readings.\



21\. "*Galavāṭaka*," here rendered by "nape of the neck," which the
context demands. But elsewhere (e.g. IV.47, VIII.110) "base of the neck"
seems indicated, that is, where the neck fits on to the body, or
"gullet."



[]



[]



fire. \[250\] Even if head hairs are not directly repulsive in colour
and shape, still their odour is directly repulsive. Just as a baby's
excrement, as to its colour, is the colour of turmeric and, as to its
shape, is the shape of a piece of turmeric root, and just as the bloated
carcass of a black dog thrown on a rubbish heap, as to its colour, is
the colour of a ripe palmyra fruit and, as to its shape, is the shape of
a \[mandolin-shaped\] drum left face down, and its fangs are like
jasmine buds, and so even if both these are not directly repulsive in
colour and shape, still their odour is directly repulsive, so too, even
if head hairs are not directly repulsive in colour and shape, still
their odour is directly repulsive.



[87.] But just as pot herbs that grow on village sewage in a
filthy place are disgusting to civilized people and unusable, so also
head hairs are disgusting since they grow on the sewage of pus, blood,
urine, dung, bile, phlegm, and the like. This is the repulsive aspect of
the *habitat*.



[88.]And these head hairs grow on the heap of the \[other\]
thirty-one parts as fungi do on a dung-hill. And owing to the filthy
place they grow in they are quite as unappetizing as vegetables growing
on a charnel-ground, on a midden, etc., as lotuses or water lilies
growing in drains, and so on. This is the repulsive aspect of their
*location*.



[89.]And as in the case of head hairs, so also the
repulsiveness of all the parts should be defined (b) in the same five
ways by colour, shape, odour, habitat, and location. All, however, must
be defined individually (a) by colour, shape, direction, location, and
delimitation, as follows.



\[Body Hairs\]



[90.]Herein, firstly, as to natural *colour*, body, hairs are
not pure black like head hairs but blackish brown. As to *shape*, they
are the shape of palm roots with the tips bent down. As to *direction*,
they lie in the two directions. As to *location*, except for the
locations where the head hairs are established, and for the palms of the
hands and soles of the feet, they grow in most of the rest of the inner
skin that envelops the body. As to *delimitation*, they are bounded
below by the surface of their own roots, which are fixed by entering to
the extent of a *likhā22 into the inner skin that envelops the body,
above by space, and all round by each other. T*here are no two body
hairs together. This is the delimitation by the similar. But their
delimitation by the dissimilar is like that for the head hairs. \[Note:
These two last sentences are repeated verbatim at the end of the
description of each part. They are not translated in the remaining
thirty parts\].



\[Nails\]



[91.] "Nails" is the name for the twenty nail plates. They are
all white as to *colour*. As to *shape*, they are the shape of fish
scales. As to *direction*: the toenails are in the lower direction; the
fingernails are in the upper direction. \[251\] So they grow in the two
directions. As to *location*, they are fixed on the tips of the backs of
the fingers and toes. As to *delimitation*, they are bounded in the two



22\. A measure of length, as much as a "louse's head."



[]



[]



directions by the flesh of the ends of the fingers and toes, and inside
by the flesh of the backs of the fingers and toes, and externally and at
the end by space, and all round by each other. There are no two nails
together ...



\[Teeth\]



[92.]There are thirty-two tooth bones in one whose teeth are
complete. They are white in *colour*. As to *shape*, they are of various
shapes; for firstly in the lower row, the four middle teeth are the
shape of pumpkin seeds set in a row in a lump of clay; that on each side
of them has one root and one point and is the shape of a jasmine bud;
each one after that has two roots and two points and is the shape of a
wagon prop; then two each side with three roots and three points, then
two each side four-rooted and four-pointed. Likewise in the upper row.
As to *direction*, they lie in the upper direction. As to *location*,
they are fixed in the jawbones. As to  *delimitation*, they are bounded
by the surface of their own roots which are fixed in the jawbones; they
are bounded above by space, and all round by each other. There are no
two teeth together ...



\[Skin (Taca)\]



[93.] The inner skin envelops the whole body. Outside it is
what is called the outer cuticle, which is black, brown or yellow in
colour, and when that from the whole of the body is compressed together,
it amounts to only as much as a jujube-fruit kernel. But as to *colour*,
the skin itself is white; and its whiteness becomes evident when the
outer cuticle is destroyed by contact with the flame of a fire or the
impact of a blow and so on.



[94.]As to *shape*, it is the shape of the body in brief. But
in detail, the skin of the toes is the shape of silkworms' cocoons; the
skin of the back of the foot is the shape of shoes with uppers; the skin
of the calf is the shape of a palm leaf wrapping cooked rice; the skin
of the thighs is the shape of a long sack full of paddy; the skin of the
buttocks is the shape of a cloth strainer full of water; the skin of the
back is the shape of hide streched over a plank; the skin of the belly
is the shape of the hide stretched over the body of a lute; the skin of
the chest is more or less square; the skin of both arms is the shape of
the hide stretched over a quiver; the skin of the backs of the hands is
the shape of a razor box, or the shape of a comb case; the skin of the
fingers is the shape of a key box; the skin of the neck is the shape of
a collar for the throat; the skin of the face \[252\] is the shape of an
insects' nest full of holes; the skin of the head is the shape of a bowl
bag.



[95.]The meditator who is discerning the skin should first
define the inner skin that covers the face, working his knowledge over
the face beginning with the upper lip. Next, the inner skin of the
frontal bone. Next, he should define the inner skin of the head,
separating, as it were, the inner skin's connection with the bone by
inserting his knowledge in between the cranium bone and the inner skin
of the head, as he might his hand in between the bag and the bowl put in
the bag. Next, the inner skin of the shoulders. Next, the inner skin of
the right arm forwards and backwards; and then in the same way the inner
skin of the left



[]



[]



arm. Next, after defining the inner skin of the back, he should define
the inner skin of the right leg forwards and backwards; then the inner
skin of the left leg in the same way. Next, the inner skin of the groin,
the paunch, the bosom and the neck should be successively defined. Then,
after defining the inner skin of the lower jaw next after that of the
neck, he should finish on arriving at the lower lip. When he discerns it
in the gross in this way, it becomes evident to him more subtly too.



[96.]As to *direction*, it lies in both directions. As to
*location*, it covers the whole body. As to *delimitation*, it is
bounded below by its fixed surface, and above by space ...



\[Flesh\]



[97.]There are nine hundred pieces of flesh. As to *colour*, it
is all red, like *kiṃsuka* flowers. As to *shape*, the flesh of the
calves is the shape of cooked rice in a palm- leaf bag. The flesh of the
thighs is the shape of a rolling pin.23 The flesh of the buttocks is the
shape of the end of an oven. The flesh of the back is the shape of a
slab of palm sugar. The flesh between each two ribs is the shape of clay
mortar squeezed thin in a flattened opening. The flesh of the breast is
the shape of a lump of clay made into a ball and flung down. The flesh
of the two upper arms is the shape of a large skinned rat and twice the
size. When he discerns it grossly in this way, it becomes evident to him
subtly too.



[98.]As to *direction*, it lies in both directions. As to
*location*, it is plastered over the three hundred and odd bones.
\[253\] As to *delimitation*, it is bounded below by its surface, which
is fixed on to the collection of bones, and above by the skin, and all
round each by each other piece ...



\[Sinews\]



[99.]There are nine hundred sinews. As to *colour*, all the
sinews are white. As to *shape*, they have various shapes. For five of
great sinews that bind the body together start out from the upper part
of the neck and descend by the front, and five more by the back, and
then five by the right and five by the left. And of those that bind the
right hand, five descend by the front of the hand and five by the back;
likewise those that bind the left hand. And of those that bind the right
foot, five descend by the front and five by the back; likewise those
that bind the left foot. So there are sixty great sinews called "body
supporters" which descend \[from the neck\] and bind the body together;
and they are also called "tendons." They are all the shape of yam
shoots. But there are others scattered over various parts of the body,
which are finer than the last-named. They are the shape of strings and
cords. There are others still finer, the shape of creepers. Others still
finer are the shape of large lute strings. Yet others are the shape of
coarse thread. The sinews in the backs of the hands and feet are the
shape of a bird's claw. The sinews in the head are the shape of
children's head nets. The sinews in the back are the shape of a



23\. *Nisadapota---*"*rolling pin*": (= *silā-puttaka---*Vism-mhṭ 250)
What is meant is probably the stone roller, thicker in the middle than
at the ends, with which curry spices, etc., are normally rolled by hand
on a small stone slab in Sri Lanka today.



[]



[]



wet net spread out in the sun. The rest of the sinews, following the
various limbs, are the shape of a net jacket fitted to the body.



[100.]As to *direction*, they lie in the two directions. As to
*location*, they are to be found binding the bones of the whole body
together. As to *delimitation*, they are bounded below by their surface,
which is fixed on to the three hundred bones, and above by the portions
that are in contact with the flesh and the inner skin, and all round by
each other ...



\[Bones\]



[101.] Excepting the thirty-two teeth bones, these consist of
the remaining sixty- four hand bones, sixty-four foot bones, sixty-four
soft bones dependent on the flesh, two heel bones; then in each leg two
ankle bones, two shin bones, one knee bone and one thigh bone; then two
hip bones, eighteen spine bones, \[254\] twenty- four rib bones,
fourteen breast bones, one heart bone (sternum), two collar bones, two
shoulder blade bones,24 two upper-arm bones, two pairs of forearm bones,
two neck bones, two jaw bones, one nose bone, two eye bones, two ear
bones, one frontal bone, one occipital bone, nine sincipital bones. So
there are exactly three hundred bones. As to *colour*, they are all
white. As to *shape*, they are of various shapes.



[102.]Herein, the end bones of the toes are the shape of
*kataka* seeds. Those next to them in the middle sections are the shape
of jackfruit seeds. The bones of the base sections are the shape of
small drums. The bones of the back of the foot are the shape of a bunch
of bruised yarns. The heel bone is the shape of the seed of a
single-stone palmyra fruit.



[103.] The ankle bones are the shape of \[two\] play balls
bound together. The shin bones, in the place where they rest on the
ankle bones, are the shape of a *sindi* shoot without the skin removed.
The small shin bone is the shape of a\[toy\] bow stick. The large one is
the shape of a shrivelled snake's back. The knee bone is the shape of a
lump of froth melted on one side. Herein, the place where the shin bone
rests on it is the shape of a blunt cow's horn. The thigh bone is the
shape of a badly-pared25 handle for an axe or hatchet. The place where
it fits into the hip bone is the shape of a play ball. The place in the
hip bone where it is set is the shape of a big *punnāga* fruit with the
end cut off.



[104.] The two hip bones, when fastened together, are the shape
of the ring- fastening of a smith's hammer. The buttock bone on the end
\[of them\] is the shape of an inverted snake's hood. It is perforated
in seven or eight places. The spine bones are internally the shape of
lead-sheet pipes put one on top of the other; externally they are the
shape of a string of beads. They have two or three rows of projections
next to each other like the teeth of a saw.



24\. *Koṭṭhaṭṭhīni---*"shoulder-blade bones": for *koṭṭha* (= flat) cf.
*koṭṭhalika* §97; the meaning is demanded by the context, otherwise no
mention would be made of these two bones, and the description fits. PED
under this ref. has "stomach bone" (?). Should one read *a-tikhiṇa*
(blunt) or *ati-khiṇa* (very sharp)?



25\. *Duttacchita---*"badly pared": *tacchita*, pp. of *tacchati* to
pare (e.g. with an adze); not in PED; see M I 31,124; III 166.



[]



[]



[105.]Of the twenty-four rib bones, the incomplete ones are the
shape of incomplete sabres, \[255\] and the complete ones are the shape
of complete sabres; all together they are like the outspread wings of a
white cock. The fourteen breast bones are the shape of an old chariot
frame.26 The heart bone (sternum) is the shape of the bowl of a spoon.
The collar bones are the shape of small metal knife handles. The
shoulder- blade bones are the shape of a Sinhalese hoe worn down on one
side.



[106.] The upper-arm bones are the shape of looking glass
handles. The forearm bones are the shape of a twin palm's trunks. The
wrist bones are the shape of lead-sheet pipes stuck together. The bones
of the back of the hand are the shape of a bundle of bruised yams. As to
the fingers, the bones of the base sections are the shape of small
drums; those of the middle sections are the shape of immature jackfruit
seeds; those of the end sections are the shape of *kataka* seeds.



[107.] The seven neck bones are the shape of rings of bamboo
stem threaded one after the other on a stick. The lower jawbone is the
shape of a smith's iron hammer ring-fastening. The upper one is the
shape of a knife for scraping \[the rind off sugarcanes\]. The bones of
the eye sockets and nostril sockets are the shape of young palmyra seeds
with the kernels removed. The frontal bone is the shape of an inverted
bowl made of a shell. The bones of the ear-holes are the shape of
barbers' razor boxes. The bone in the place where a cloth is tied
\[round the head\] above the frontal bone and the ear holes is the shape
of a piece of curled-up toffee flake.27 The occipital bone is the shape
of a lopsided coconut with a hole cut in the end. The sincipital bones
are the shape of a dish made of an old gourd held together with
stitches.



[108.]As to *direction*, they lie in both directions. As to
*location*, they are to be found indiscriminately throughout the whole
body. But in particular here, the head bones rest on the neck bones, the
neck bones on the spine bones, the spine bones on the hip bones, the hip
bones on the thigh bones, the thigh bones on the knee bones, the knee
bones on the shin bones, the shin bones on the ankle bones, the ankle
bones on the bones of the back of the foot. As to *delimitation*, they
are bounded inside by the bone marrow, above by the flesh, at the ends
and at the roots by each other ...



\[Bone Marrow\]



[109.] This is the marrow inside the various bones. As to
*colour*, it is white. As to *shape*, \[256\] that inside each large
bone is the shape of a large cane shoot moistened and inserted into a
bamboo tube. That inside each small bone is the shape of a slender cane
shoot moistened and inserted in a section of bamboo twig. As to
*direction*, it lies in both directions. As to *location*, it is set
inside the bones. As to *delimitation*, it is delimited by the inner
surface of the bones ...



26\. *Pañjara---*"frame": not quite in this sense in PED.\



27\. *Saṅkuṭitaghaṭapuṇṇapaṭalakhaṇḍa---*"a piece of curled-up toffee
flake." The Sinhalese translation suggests the following readings and

*saṅkuṭita*, curled up); *ghata-puṇṇa* (\[toffee?\] "full of ghee");
*paṭala* (flake or slab); *khaṇḍa* (piece).

\[Kidney\]



[110.] This is two pieces of flesh with a single ligature. As
to *colour*, it is dull red, the colour of *pālibhaddaka* (coral tree)
seeds. As to *shape*, it is the shape of a pair of child's play balls;
or it is the shape of a pair of mango fruits attached to a single stalk.
As to *direction*, it lies in the upper direction. As to *location*, it
is to be found on either side of the heart flesh, being fastened by a
stout sinew that starts out with one root from the base of the neck and
divides into two after going a short way. As to *delimitation*, the
kidney is bounded by what appertains to kidney ...



\[Heart\]



[111.] This is the heart flesh. As to *colour*, it is the
colour of the back of a red-lotus petal. As to *shape*, it is the shape
of a lotus bud with the outer petals removed and turned upside down; it
is smooth outside, and inside it is like the interior of a *kosātakī *
(loofah gourd). In those who possess understanding it is a little
expanded; in those without understanding it is still only a bud. Inside
it there is a hollow the size of a *punnāga* seed's bed where half a
*pasata* measure of blood is kept, with which as their support the mind
element and mind-consciousness element occur.



[112.] That in one of greedy temperament is red; that in one of
hating temperament is black; that in one of deluded temperament is like
water that meat has been washed in; that in one of speculative
temperament is like lentil soup in colour; that in one of faithful
temperament is the colour of \[yellow\] *kanikāra* flowers; that in one
of understanding temperament is limpid, clear, unturbid, bright, pure,
like a washed gem of pure water, and it seems to shine.



[113.]As to *direction*, it lies in the upper direction. As to
*location*, it is to be found in the middle between the two breasts,
inside the body. As to *delimitation*, it is bounded by what appertains
to heart ... \[257\]



\[Liver\]



[114.] This is a twin slab of flesh. As to *colour*, it is a
brownish shade of red, the colour of the not-too-red backs of white
water-lily petals. As to *shape*, with its single root and twin ends, it
is the shape of a *koviḷāra* leaf. In sluggish people it is single and
large; in those possessed of understanding there are two or three small
ones. As to *direction*, it lies in the upper direction. As to
*location*, it is to be found on the right side, inside from the two
breasts. As to *delimitation*, it is bounded by what appertains to liver
...



\[Midriff\]28



[115.]This is the covering of the flesh, which is of two kinds,
namely, the concealed and the unconcealed. As to *colour*, both kinds
are white, the colour of *dukūla* (muslin) rags. As to *shape*, it is
the shape of its location. As to *direction*, the



28\. *Kilomaka---*"midriff": the rendering is obviously quite inadequate
for what is described here, but there is no appropriate English word.



[]



[]



concealed midriff lies in the upper direction, the other in both
directions. As to *location*, the concealed midriff is to be found
concealing the heart and kidney; the unconcealed is to be found covering
the flesh under the inner skin throughout the whole body. As to
*delimitation*, it is bounded below by the flesh, above by the inner
skin, and all round by what appertains to midriff ...



\[Spleen\]



[116.] This is the flesh of the belly's "tongue." As to
*colour*, it is blue, the colour of *nigguṇḍi* flowers. As to *shape*,
it is seven fingers in size, without attachments, and the shape of a
black calf's tongue. As to *direction*, it lies in the upper direction.
As to *location*, it is to be found near the upper side of the belly to
the left of the heart. When it comes out through a wound a being's life
is terminated. As to *delimitation*, it is bounded by what appertains to
spleen ...



\[Lungs\]



[117.] The flesh of the lungs is divided up into two or three
pieces of flesh. As to *colour*, it is red, the colour of not very ripe
*udumbara* fig fruits. As to *shape*, it is the shape of an unevenly cut
thick slice of cake. Inside, it is insipid and lacks nutritive essence,
like a lump of chewed straw, because it is affected by the heat of the
kamma-born fire \[element\] that springs up when there is need of
something to eat and drink. As to *direction*, it lies in the upper
direction. As to *location*, it is to be found inside the body between
the two breasts, hanging above the heart \[258\] and liver and
concealing them. As to *delimitation*, it is bounded by what appertains
to lungs ...



\[Bowel\]



[118.] This is the bowel tube; it is looped29 in twenty-one
places, and in a man it is thirty-two hands long, and in a woman,
twenty-eight hands. As to *colour*, it is white, the colour of lime
\[mixed\] with sand. As to *shape*, it is the shape of a beheaded snake
coiled up and put in a trough of blood. As to *direction*, it lies in
the two directions. As to *location*, it is fastened above at the gullet
and below to the excrement passage (rectum), so it is to be found inside
the body between the limits of the gullet and the excrement passage. As
to *delimitation*, it is bounded by what pertains to bowel ...



\[Entrails (Mesentery)\]



[119.] This is the fastening in the places where the bowel is
coiled. As to *colour*, it is white, the colour of *dakasītalika*30
*(white edible water lily) roots. As to shape*, it is the shape of those
roots too. As to *direction*, it lies in the two directions. As to
*location*, it is to be found inside the twenty-one coils of the bowel,
like the strings

(XI.64 and PED).



30\. *Dakasītalika*: not in PED; rendered in Sinhalese translation by

[]



[]



to be found inside rope-rings for wiping the feet on, sewing them
together, and it fastens the bowel's coils together so that they do not
slip down in those working with hoes, axes, etc., as the
marionette-strings do the marionette's wooden \[limbs\] at the time of
the marionette's being pulled along. As to *delimitation*, it is bounded
by what appertains to entrails ...



\[Gorge\]



[120.] This is what has been eaten, drunk, chewed and tasted,
and is present in the stomach. As to *colour*, it is the colour of
swallowed food. As to *shape*, it is the shape of rice loosely tied in a
cloth strainer. As to *direction*, it is in the upper direction. As to
*location*, it is in the stomach.



[121.] What is called the "stomach" is \[a part of\] the
bowel-membrane, which is like the swelling \[of air\] produced in the
middle of a length of wet cloth when it is being \[twisted and\] wrung
out from the two ends. It is smooth outside. Inside, it is like a
balloon of cloth31 soiled by wrapping up meat refuse; or it can be said
to be like the inside of the skin of a rotten jack fruit. It is the
place where worms dwell seething in tangles: the thirty-two families of
worms, such as round worms, boil-producing worms, "palm-splinter" worms,
needle-mouthed worms, tape- worms, thread worms, and the rest.32 When
there is no food and drink, \[259\] etc., present, they leap up
shrieking and pounce upon the heart's flesh; and when food and drink,
etc., are swallowed, they wait with uplifted mouths and scramble to
snatch the first two or three lumps swallowed. It is these worms'
maternity home, privy, hospital and charnel ground. Just as when it has
rained heavily in a time of drought and what has been carried by the
water into the cesspit at the gate of an outcaste village---the various
kinds of ordure33 such as urine, excrement, bits of hide and bones and
sinews, as well as spittle, snot, blood, etc.---gets mixed up with the
mud and water already collected there; and after two or three days the
families of worms appear, and it ferments, warmed by the energy of the
sun's heat, frothing and bubbling on the top, quite black in colour, and
so utterly stinking and loathsome that one can scarcely go near it or
look at it, much less smell or taste it, so too, \[the stomach is
where\] the assortment of food, drink, etc., falls after being pounded
up by the tongue and stuck together with spittle and



31\. *Maṃsaka-sambupali-veṭhana-kiliṭṭha-pāvāra-pupphaka-sadisa*: this
is rendered into Sinhalese by *kuṇu mas kasaḷa velu porõnā kaḍek pup*
("an inflated piece (or bag) of cloth, which has wrapped rotten meat
refuse"). In PED *pāvāra* is given as "cloak, mantle" and (this ref.) as
"the mango tree"; but there seems to be no authority for the rendering
"mango tree," which has nothing to do with this context. *Pupphaka*
(balloon) is not in PED (cf. common Burmese spelling of *bubbuḷa*
(bubble) as *pupphuḷa*).



32\. It would be a mistake to take the renderings of these worms' names
too literally. *Gaṇḍuppada* (boil-producing worm?) appears only as
"earth worm" in PED, which will not do here. The more generally accepted
reading seems to take *paṭatantuka* and *suttaka* (tape-worm and
thread-worm) as two kinds rather than *paṭatantusuttaka*; neither is in
PED.\



33\. *Kuṇapa---*"ordure"; PED only gives the meaning "corpse," which
does not fit the meaning either here or, e.g., at XI.21, where the sense
of a dead body is inappropriate.

saliva, losing at that moment its virtues of colour, smell, taste, etc.,
and taking on the appearance of weavers' paste and dogs' vomit, then to
get soused in the bile and phlegm and wind that have collected there,
where it ferments with the energy of the stomach-fire's heat, seethes
with the families of worms, frothing and bubbling on the top, till it
turns into utterly stinking nauseating muck, even to hear about which
takes away any appetite for food, drink, etc., let alone to see it with
the eye of understanding. And when the food, drink, etc., fall into it,
they get divided into five parts: the worms eat one part, the
stomach-fire bums up another part, another part becomes urine, another
part becomes excrement, and one part is turned into nourishment and
sustains the blood, flesh and so on.



[122.] As to *delimitation*, it is bounded by the stomach
lining and by what appertains to gorge ...



\[Dung\]



[123.] This is excrement. As to *colour*, it is mostly the
colour of eaten food. As to *shape*, it is the shape of its location. As
to *direction*, it is in the lower direction. As to *location*, it is to
be found in the receptacle for digested food (rectum).



[124.] The receptacle for digested food is the lowest part at
the end of the bowel, between the navel and the root of the spine.
\[260\] It measures eight fingerbreadths in height and resembles a
bamboo tube. Just as when rain water falls on a higher level it runs
down to fill a lower level and stays there, so too, the receptacle for
digested food is where any food, drink, etc., that have fallen into the
receptacle for undigested food, have been continuously cooked and
simmered by the stomach-fire, and have got as soft as though ground up
on a stone, run down to through the cavities of the bowels, and it is
pressed down there till it becomes impacted like brown clay pushed into
a bamboo joint, and there it stays.



[125.]As to *delimitation*, it is bounded by the receptacle for
digested food and by what appertains to dung ...



\[Brain\]



[126.] This is the lumps of marrow to be found inside the
skull. As to *colour*, it is white, the colour of the flesh of a
toadstool; it can also be said that it is the colour of turned milk that
has not yet become curd. As to *shape*, it is the shape of its location.
As to *direction*, it belongs to the upper direction. As to *location*,
it is to be found inside the skull, like four lumps of dough put
together to correspond with the \[skull's\] four sutured sections. As to
*delimitation*, it is bounded by the skull's inner surface and by what
appertains to brain ...



\[Bile\]



[127.] There are two kinds of bile: local bile and free bile.
Herein as to *colour*, the local bile is the colour of thick *madhuka *
oil; the free bile is the colour of faded *ākulī* flowers. As to
*shape*, both are the shape of their location. As to *direction*, the
local bile belongs to the upper direction; the other belongs to both
directions. As to  *location*, the free bile spreads, like a drop of oil
on water, all over the body



[]



[]



except for the fleshless parts of the head hairs, body hairs, teeth,
nails, and the hard dry skin. When it is disturbed, the eyes become
yellow and twitch, and there is shivering and itching34  of the body.
The local bile is situated near the flesh of the liver between the heart
and the lungs. It is to be found in the bile container (gall bladder),
which is like a large *kosātakī* (loofah) gourd pip. When it is
disturbed, beings go crazy and become demented, they throw off
conscience and shame and do the undoable, speak the unspeakable, and
think the unthinkable. As to *delimitation*, it is bounded by what
appertains to bile ... \[261\]



\[Phlegm\]



[128.] The phlegm is inside the body and it measures a bowlful.
As to *colour*, it is white, the colour of the juice of *nāgabalā*
leaves. As to *shape*, it is the shape of its location. As to
*direction*, it belongs to the upper direction. As to *location*, it is
to be found on the stomach's surface. Just as duckweed and green scum on
the surface of water divide when a stick or a potsherd is dropped into
the water and then spread together again, so too, at the time of eating
and drinking, etc., when the food, drink, etc., fall into the stomach,
the phlegm divides and then spreads together again. And if it gets weak
the stomach becomes utterly disgusting with a smell of ordure, like a
ripe boil or a rotten hen's egg, and then the belchings and the mouth
reek with a stench like rotting ordure rising from the stomach, so that
the man has to be told, "Go away, your breath smells." But when it grows
plentiful it holds the stench of ordure beneath the surface of the
stomach, acting like the wooden lid of a privy. As to *delimitation*, it
is bounded by what appertains to phlegm ...



\[Pus\]



[129.] Pus is produced by decaying blood. As to *colour*, it is
the colour of bleached leaves; but in a dead body it is the colour of
stale thickened gruel. As to *shape*, it is the shape of its location.
As to *direction*, it belongs to both directions. As to *location*,
however, there is no fixed location for pus where it could be found
stored up. Wherever blood stagnates and goes bad in some part of the
body damaged by wounds with stumps and thorns, by burns with fire, etc.,
or where boils, carbuncles, etc., appear, it can be found there. As to
*delimitation*, it is bounded by what appertains to pus ...



\[Blood\]



[130.]There are two kinds of blood: stored blood and mobile
blood. Herein, as to *colour*, stored blood is the colour of cooked and
thickened lac solution; mobile blood is the colour of clear lac
solution. As to *shape*, both are the shape of their locations. As to
*direction*, the stored blood belongs to the upper direction; the other
belongs to both directions. As to *location*, except for the fleshless
parts of the head hairs, body hairs, teeth, nails, and the hard dry
skin, the mobile blood permeates the whole of the clung-to
(kammically-acquired)35 body by following the network of veins. The



34\. *Kaṇḍūyati---*"to itch": the verb is not in PED; see *kaṇḍu*.



[]



[]



stored blood fills the lower part of the liver's site \[262\] to the
extent of a bowlful, and by its splashing little by little over the
heart, kidney and lungs, it keeps the kidney, heart, liver and lungs
moist. For it is when it fails to moisten the kidney, heart, etc., that
beings become thirsty. As to *delimitation*, it is bounded by what
appertains to blood ...



\[Sweat\]



[131.] This is the water element that trickles from the pores
of the body hairs, and so on. As to *colour*, it is the colour of clear
sesame oil. As to *shape*, it is the shape of its location. As to
*direction*, it belongs to both directions. As to *location*, there is
no fixed location for sweat where it could always be found like blood.
But if the body is heated by the heat of a fire, by the sun's heat, by a
change of temperature, etc., then it trickles from all the pore openings
of the head hairs and body hairs, as water does from a bunch of unevenly
cut lily-bud stems and lotus stalks pulled up from the water. So its
shape should also be understood to correspond to the pore-openings of
the head hairs and body hairs. And the meditator who discerns sweat
should only give his attention to it as it is to be found filling the
pore-openings of the head hairs and body hairs. As to *delimitation*, it
is bounded by what appertains to sweat ...



\[Fat\]



[132.] This is a thick unguent. As to colour, it is the colour
of sliced turmeric. As to shape, firstly in the body of a stout man it
is the shape of turmeric-coloured *dukūla* (muslin) rags placed between
the inner skin and the flesh. In the body of a lean man it is the shape
of turmeric-coloured *dukūla* (muslin) rags placed in two or three
thicknesses on the shank flesh, thigh flesh, back flesh near the spine,
and belly-covering flesh. As to direction, it belongs to both
directions. As to location, it permeates the whole of a stout man's
body; it is to be found on a lean man's shank flesh, and so on. And
though it was described as "unguent" above, still it is neither used as
oil on the head nor as oil for the nose, etc., because of its utter
disgustingness. As to delimitation, it is bounded below by the flesh,
above by the inner skin, and all round by what appertains to fat ...



\[Tears\]



[133.] These are the water element that trickles from the eye.
As to *colour*, they are the colour of clear sesame oil. As to *shape*,
they are the shape of their location. \[263\] As to *direction*, they
belong to the upper direction. As to *location*, they are to be found in
the eye sockets. But they are not stored in the eye sockets all the
while as the bile is in the bile container. But when beings feel joy and
laugh uproariously, or feel grief and weep and lament, or eat particular
kinds of wrong food, or when their eyes are affected by smoke, dust,
dirt, etc., then being originated by the joy, grief, wrong food, or
temperature, they fill up the eye sockets or trickle out. And the
meditator who discerns tears should discern them only as they are



35\. *Upādiṇṇa---*"clung-to": see Ch. XIV, note 23.



[]



[]



to be found filling the eye sockets. As to *delimitation*, they are
bounded by what appertains to tears ...



\[Grease\]



[134.] This is a melted unguent. As to *colour*, it is the
colour of coconut oil. Also it can be said to be the colour of oil
sprinkled on gruel. As to *shape*, it is a film the shape of a drop of
unguent spread out over still water at the time of bathing. As to
*direction*, it belongs to both directions. As to *location*, it is to
be found mostly on the palms of the hands, backs of the hands, soles of
the feet, backs of the feet, tip of the nose, forehead, and points of
the shoulders. And it is not always to be found in the melted state in
these locations, but when these parts get hot with the heat of a fire,
the sun's heat, upset of temperature or upset of elements, then it
spreads here and there in those places like the film from the drop of
unguent on the still water at the time of bathing. As to *delimitation*,
it is bounded by what appertains to grease ...



\[Spittle\]



[135.] This is water element mixed with froth inside the mouth.
As to *colour*, it is white, the colour of the froth. As to *shape*, it
is the shape of its location, or it can be called "the shape of froth."
As to *direction*, it belongs to the upper direction. As to *location*,
it is to be found on the tongue after it has descended from the cheeks
on both sides. And it is not always to be found stored there; but when
beings see particular kinds of food, or remember them, or put something
hot or bitter or sharp or salty or sour into their mouths, or when their
hearts are faint, or nausea arises on some account, then spittle appears
and runs down from the cheeks on both sides to settle on the tongue. It
is thin at the tip of the tongue, and thick at the root of the tongue.
It is capable, without getting used up, of wetting unhusked rice or
husked rice or anything else chewable that is put into the mouth, like
the water in a pit scooped out in a river sand bank. \[264\] As to
*delimitation*, it is bounded by what appertains to spittle ...



\[Snot\]



[136.] This is impurity that trickles out from the brain. As to
*colour*, it is the colour of a young palmyra kernel. As to *shape*, it
is the shape of its location. As to *direction*, it belongs to the upper
direction. As to *location*, it is to be found filling the nostril
cavities. And it is not always to be found stored there; but rather,
just as though a man tied up curd in a lotus leaf, which he then pricked
with a thorn underneath, and whey oozed out and dripped, so too, when
beings weep or suffer a disturbance of elements produced by wrong food
or temperature, then the brain inside the head turns into stale phlegm,
and it oozes out and comes down by an opening in the palate, and it
fills the nostrils and stays there or trickles out. And the meditator
who discerns snot should discern it only as it is to be found filling
the nostril cavities. As to *delimitation*, it is bounded by what
appertains to snot ...



[]



[]



\[Oil of the Joints\]



[137.] This is the slimy ordure inside the joints in the body.
As to *colour*, it is the colour of *kaṇikāra* gum. As to *shape*, it is
the shape of its location. As to *direction*, it belongs to both
directions. As to *location*, it is to be found inside the hundred and
eighty joints, serving the function of lubricating the bones' joints. If
it is weak, when a man gets up or sits down, moves forward or backward,
bends or stretches, then his bones creak, and he goes about making a
noise like the snapping of fingers, and when he has walked only one or
two leagues' distance, his air element gets upset and his limbs pain
him. But if a man has plenty of it, his bones do not creak when he gets
up, sits down, etc., and even when he has walked a long distance, his
air element does not get upset and his limbs do not pain him. As to
*delimitation*, it is bounded by what appertains to oil of the joints
...



\[Urine\]



[138.] This is the urine solution. As to *colour*, it is the
colour of bean brine. As to *shape*, it is the shape of water inside a
water pot placed upside down. As to *direction*, it belongs to the lower
direction. As to *location*, it is to be found inside the bladder. For
the bladder sack is called the bladder. Just as when a porous pot with
no mouth is put into a cesspool, \[265\] then the solution from the
cesspool gets into the porous pot with no mouth even though no way of
entry is evident, so too, while the urinary secretion from the body
enters the bladder its way of entry is not evident. Its way of exit,
however, is evident. And when the bladder is full of urine, beings feel
the need to make water. As to *delimitation*, it is delimited by the
inside of the bladder and by what is similar to urine. This is the
delimitation by the similar. But its delimitation by the dissimilar is
like that for the head hairs (see note at end of §90).



\[The Arising of Absorption\]



[139.] When the meditator has defined the parts beginning with
the head hairs in this way by colour, shape, direction, location and
delimitation (§58), and he gives his attention in the ways beginning
with "following the order, not too quickly" (§61) to their repulsiveness
in the five aspects of colour, shape, smell, habitat, and location
(§84f.), then at last he surmounts the concept (§66). Then just as when
a man with good sight is observing a garland of flowers of thirty- two
colours knotted on a single string and all the flowers become evident to
him simultaneously, so too, when the meditator observes this body thus,
"There are in this body head hairs," then all these things become
evident to him, as it were, simultaneously. Hence it was said above in
the explanation of skill in giving attention: "For when a beginner gives
his attention to head hairs, his attention carries on till it arrives at
the last part, that is, urine, and stops there" (§67).



[140.] If he applies his attention externally as well when all
the parts have become evident in this way, then human beings, animals,
etc., as they go about are divested of their aspect of beings and appear
as just assemblages of parts. And



[]



[]



when drink, food, etc., is being swallowed by them, it appears as though
it were being put in among the assemblage of parts.



[141.] Then, as he gives his attention to them again and again
as "Repulsive, repulsive," employing the process of "successive
leaving," etc. (§67), eventually absorption arises in him. Herein, the
appearance of the head hairs, etc., as to colour, shape, direction,
location, and delimitation is the learning sign; their appearance as
repulsive in all aspects is the counterpart sign.



As he cultivates and develops that counterpart sign, absorption arises
in him, but only of the first jhāna, in the same way as described under
foulness as a meditation subject (VI.64f.). And it arises singly in one
to whom only one part has become evident, or who has reached absorption
in one part and makes no further effort about another.



[142.] But several first jhānas, according to the number of
parts, are produced in one to whom several parts have become evident, or
who has reached jhāna in one and also makes further effort about
another. As in the case of the Elder Mallaka. \[266\]



The elder, it seems, took the Elder Abhaya, the Dīgha reciter, by the
hand,36 and after saying "Friend Abhaya, first learn this matter," he
went on: "The Elder Mallaka is an obtainer of thirty-two jhānas in the
thirty-two parts. If he enters upon one by night and one by day, he goes
on entering upon them for over a fortnight; but if he enters upon one
each day, he goes on entering upon them for over a month."



[143.] And although this meditation is successful in this way
with the first jhāna, it is nevertheless called "mindfulness occupied
with the body" because it is successful through the influence of the
mindfulness of the colour, shape, and so on.



[144.] And the bhikkhu who is devoted to this mindfulness
occupied with the body "is a conqueror of boredom and delight, and
boredom does not conquer him; he dwells transcending boredom as it
arises. He is a conqueror of fear and dread, and fear and dread do not
conquer him; he dwells transcending fear and dread as they arise. He is
one who bears cold and heat ... who endures ... arisen bodily feelings
that are ... menacing to life" (M III 97); he becomes an obtainer of the
four jhānas based on the colour aspect of the head hairs,37 etc.; and he
comes to penetrate the six kinds of direct-knowledge (see MN 6).



So let a man, if he is wise,\
Untiringly devote his days\
To mindfulness of body which\
Rewards him in so many ways.



36\. Reference is sometimes made to the "hand-grasping question"
(*hattha-gahaka* *pañhā*). It may be to this; but there is another
mentioned at the end of the commentary to the Dhātu-Vibhaṅga.\



37\. The allusion seems to be to the bases of mastery
(*abhibhāyatana---*or better, bases for transcendence); see M II l3 and
M-a III 257f.; but see §60.

This is the section dealing with mindfulness occupied with the body in
the



detailed treatise.



\[(9) MINDFULNESS OF BREATHING\]



[145.] Now comes the description of the development of
mindfulness of breathing as a meditation subject. It has been
recommended by the Blessed One thus: "And, bhikkhus, this concentration
through mindfulness of breathing, when developed and practiced much, is
both peaceful and sublime, it is an unadulterated blissful abiding, and
it banishes at once and stills evil unprofitable thoughts as soon as
they arise" (S V 321; Vin III 70).



\[Text\]



It has been described by the Blessed One as having sixteen bases thus:
"And how developed, bhikkhus, how practiced much, is concentration
through mindfulness of breathing both peaceful and sublime, an
unadulterated blissful abiding, banishing at once and stilling evil
unprofitable thoughts as soon as they arise?



"Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, gone to the forest or to the root of a tree
or to an empty place, sits down; having folded his legs crosswise, set
his body erect, established mindfulness in front of him, \[267\] ever
mindful he breathes in, mindful he breathes out.



"(i) Breathing in long, he knows: 'I breathe in long;' or breathing out
long, he knows: 'I breathe out long.' (ii) Breathing in short, he knows:

[146.] The description \[of development\] is complete in all
respects, however, only if it is given in due course after a commentary
on the text. So it is given here (§186) introduced by a commentary on
the \[first part of the\] text.



\[Word Commentary\]



*And how developed, bhikkhus, how practiced much, is concentration
through mindfulness of breathing*: here in the first place *how* is a
question showing desire to explain in detail the development of
concentration through mindfulness of breathing in its various forms.
*Developed, bhikkhus, ... is concentration through mindfulness of
breathing*: this shows the thing that is being asked about out of desire
to explain it in its various forms. *How practiced much ... as soon as
they arise*?: here too the same explanation applies.



[147.] Herein,  *developed * means aroused or increased,
*concentration through* *mindfulness of breathing* (lit.
"breathing-mindfulness concentration") is either concentration
associated with mindfulness that discerns breathing, or it is
concentration on mindfulness of breathing. *Practiced much*: practiced
again and again.



[148.] *Both peaceful and sublime* (*santo c' eva paṇīto ca*):
it is peaceful in both ways and sublime in both ways; the two words
should each be understood as governed by the word "both" (*eva*). What
is meant? Unlike foulness, which as a meditation subject is peaceful and
sublime only by penetration, but is neither (*n' eva*) peaceful nor
sublime in its object since its object \[in the learning stage\] is
gross, and \[after that\] its object is repulsiveness---unlike that,
this is not unpeaceful or unsublime in any way, but on the contrary it
is peaceful, stilled and quiet both on account of the peacefulness of
its object and on account of the peacefulness of that one of its factors
called penetration. And it is sublime, something one cannot have enough
of, both on account of the sublimeness of its object and on \[268\]
account of the sublimeness of the aforesaid factor. Hence it is called
"both peaceful and sublime."



[149.] *It is an unadulterated blissful abiding*: it has no
adulteration, thus it is unadulterated; it is unalloyed, unmixed,
particular, special. Here it is not a question of peacefulness to be
reached through preliminary work \[as with the kasiṇas\] or through
access \[as with foulness, for instance\]. It is peaceful and sublime in
its own individual essence too starting with the very first attention
given to it. But some38 say that it is "unadulterated" because it is
unalloyed,



38\. "'Some' is said with reference to the inmates of the Uttara
(Northern) monastery \[in Anurādhapura\]" (Vism-mhṭ 256).



[]



[]



possessed of nutritive value and sweet in its individual essence too. So
it should be understood to be "unadulterated" and a "blissful abiding"
since it leads to the obtaining of bodily and mental bliss with every
moment of absorption.



[150.] *As soon as they arise*: whenever they are not
suppressed. *Evil*: bad. *Unprofitable * (*akusala*)  *thoughts*:
thoughts produced by unskilfulness (*akosalla*).  *It banishes at once*:
it banishes, suppresses, at that very moment. *Stills* (*vūpasameti*):
it thoroughly calms (*suṭṭhu upasameti*); or else, when eventually
brought to fulfilment by the noble path, it cuts off, because of
partaking of penetration; it tranquilizes, is what is meant.



[151.] In brief, however, the meaning here is this: "Bhikkhus,
in what way, in what manner, by what system, is concentration through
mindfulness of breathing developed, in what way is it practiced much,
that it is both peaceful ... as soon as they arise?"



[152.] He now said, "Here, bhikkhus," etc., giving the meaning
of that in detail.



Herein,  *here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu* means: bhikkhus, in this
dispensation a bhikkhu. For this word *here * signifies the \[Buddha's\]
dispensation as the prerequisite for a person to produce concentration
through mindfulness of breathing in all its modes,39 and it denies that
such a state exists in any other dispensation. For this is said:
"Bhikkhus, only here is there an ascetic, here a second ascetic, here a
third ascetic, here a fourth ascetic; other dispensations are devoid of
ascetics" (M I 63; A II 238).40 That is why it was said above "in this
dispensation a bhikkhu."



[153.] *Gone to the forest ... or to an empty place*: this
signifies that he has found an abode favourable to the development of
concentration through mindfulness of breathing. For this bhikkhu's mind
has long been dissipated among visible data, etc., as its object, and it
does not want to mount the object of concentration-
through-mindfulness-of-breathing; it runs off the track like a chariot
harnessed to a wild ox.41 Now, suppose a cowherd \[269\] wanted to tame
a wild calf that had been reared on a wild cow's milk, he would take it
away from the cow and tie it up apart with a rope to a stout post dug
into the ground; then the calf might dash to and fro, but being unable
to get away, it would eventually sit down or lie down by the post. So
too, when a bhikkhu wants to tame his own mind which has long been
spoilt by being reared on visible data, etc., as object for its food and
drink, he should take it away from visible data, etc., as object and
bring it into the forest or to the root of a tree or to an empty place
and tie it up there to the post of in-breaths and out-breaths with the
rope of mindfulness. And so his mind may then dash to and fro when it no
longer gets the objects it was formerly



39\. "The words 'in all its aspects' refer to the sixteen bases; for
these are only found in total in this dispensation. When outsiders know
mindfulness of breathing they only know the first four modes" (Vism-mhṭ
257).\



40\. "'The ascetic' is a stream-enterer, the 'second ascetic' is a
once-returner, the 'third ascetic' is a non-returner, the 'fourth
ascetic' is an Arahant" (M-a II 4).



41\. *Kūṭa---*"wild": PED, this ref. gives "useless," which misses the
point. Cf. M-a II 82; IV 198.



[]



[]



used to, but being unable to break the rope of mindfulness and get away,
it sits down, lies down, by that object under the influence of access
and absorption. Hence the Ancients said:



[154.] "Just as a man who tames a calf Would tie it to a post,
so here\
Should his own mind by mindfulness\
Be firmly to the object tied."



This is how an abode is favourable to his development. Hence it was said
above: "This signifies that he has found an abode favourable to the
development of concentration through mindfulness of breathing."



[155.]Or alternatively, this mindfulness of breathing as a
meditation subject--- which is foremost among the various meditation
subjects of all Buddhas, \[some\] Paccekabuddhas and \[some\] Buddhas'
disciples as a basis for attaining distinction and abiding in bliss here
and now---is not easy to develop without leaving the neighbourhood of
villages, which resound with the noises of women, men, elephants,
horses, etc., noise being a thorn to jhāna (see A V 135), whereas in the
forest away from a village a meditator can at his ease set about
discerning this meditation subject and achieve the fourth jhāna in
mindfulness of breathing; and then, by making that same jhāna the basis
for comprehension of formations \[with insight\] (XX.2f.), he can reach
Arahantship, the highest fruit. That is why the Blessed One said "gone
to the forest," etc., in pointing out a favourable abode for him.



[156.] For the Blessed One is like a master of the art of
building sites (see D I 9, 12; II 87). \[270\] As the master of the art
of building sites surveys the proposed site for a town, thoroughly
examines it, and then gives his directions, "Build the town here," and
when the town is safely finished, he receives great honour from the
royal family, so the Blessed One examines an abode as to its suitability
for the meditator, and he directs, "Devote yourself to the meditation
subject here," and later on, when the meditator has devoted himself to
the meditation subject and has reached Arahantship and says, "The
Blessed One is indeed fully enlightened," the Blessed One receives great
honour.



[157.] And this bhikkhu is compared to a leopard. For just as a
great leopard king lurks in a grass wilderness or a jungle wilderness or
a rock wilderness in the forest and seizes wild beasts---the wild
buffalo, wild ox, boar, etc.---so too, the bhikkhu who devotes himself
to his meditation subject in the forest, etc., should be understood to
seize successively the paths of stream-entry, once-return, non-return,
and Arahantship; and the noble fruitions as well. Hence the Ancients
said:



"For as the leopard by his lurking \[in the forest\] seizes beasts So
also will this Buddhas' son, with insight gifted,



strenuous,



By his retreating to the forest seize the highest fruit



of all" (Mil 369).



[]



[]



So the Blessed One said "gone to the forest," etc., to point out a
forest abode as



a place likely to hasten his advancement.



[158.] Herein, *gone to the forest* is gone to any kind of
forest possessing the bliss of seclusion among the kinds of forests
characterized thus: "Having gone out beyond the boundary post, all that
is forest" (Paṭis I 176; Vibh 251), and "A forest abode is five hundred
bow lengths distant" (Vin IV 183). *To the root of a tree*: gone to the
vicinity of a tree. *To an empty place*: gone to an empty, secluded
space. And here he can be said to have gone to an "empty place" if he
has gone to any of the remaining seven kinds of abode (resting place).42
\[271\]



[159.] Having thus indicated an abode that is suitable to the
three seasons, suitable to humour and temperament,43 and favourable to
the development of mindfulness of breathing, he then said sits down,
etc., indicating a posture that is peaceful and tends neither to
idleness nor to agitation. Then he said *having folded his legs
crosswise*, etc., to show firmness in the sitting position, easy
occurrence of the in-breaths and out-breaths, and the means for
discerning the object.



[160.] Herein, *crosswise* is the sitting position with the
thighs fully locked. *Folded*: having locked. *Set his body erect*:
having placed the upper part of the body erect with the eighteen
backbones resting end to end. For when he is seated like this, his skin,
flesh and sinews are not twisted, and so the feelings that would arise
moment by moment if they were twisted do not arise. That being so, his
mind becomes unified, and the meditation subject, instead of collapsing,
attains to growth and increase.



[161.] *Established mindfulness in front of him* (*parimukhaṃ
satiṃ upaṭṭhapetvā*) = having placed (*ṭhapayitvā*) mindfulness
(*satiṃ*) facing the meditation subject (*kammaṭṭhānābhimukhaṃ*). Or
alternatively, the meaning can be treated here too according to the
method of explanation given in the Paṭisambhidā, which is this: *Pari*
has the sense of control (*pariggaha*), *mukhaṃ* (lit. mouth) has the
sense of outlet (*niyyāna*),  *sati * has the sense of establishment
(*upaṭṭhāna*); that is why *parimukhaṃ satiṃ* ('mindfulness as a
controlled outlet') is said" (Paṭis I 176). The meaning of it in brief
is: Having made mindfulness the outlet (from opposition, forgetfulness
being thereby\] controlled.44



[162.] *Ever mindful he breathes in, mindful he breathes out*:
having seated himself thus, having established mindfulness thus, the
bhikkhu does not abandon that mindfulness; ever mindful he breathes in,
mindful he breathes out; he is a mindful worker, is what is meant.



42\. The nine kinds of abode (resting place) are the forest and the root
of a tree already mentioned, and a rock, a hill cleft, a mountain cave,
a charnel ground, a jungle thicket, an open space, a heap of straw (M I
181).\



43\. "In the hot season the forest is favourable, in the cold season the
root of a tree, in the rainy season an empty place. For one of
phlegmatic humour, phlegmatic by nature, the forest is favourable, for
one of bilious humour the root of a tree, for one of windy humour an
empty place. For one of deluded temperament the forest, for one of
hating temperament the root of a tree, for one of greedy temperament an
empty place" (Vism-mhṭ 258).

\[Word Commentary Continued---First Tetrad\]



[163.](i) *Now, breathing in long*, etc., is said in order to
show the different ways in which he is a mindful worker. For in the
Paṭisambhidā, in the exposition of the clause, "Ever mindful he breathes
in, mindful he breathes out," this is said: "He is a mindful worker in
thirty-two ways: (1) when he knows unification of mind and
non-distraction by means of a long in-breath, mindfulness is established
in him; owing to that mindfulness and that knowledge he is a mindful
worker. (2) When he knows unification of mind and non-distraction by
means of a long out-breath ... (31) by means of breathing in
contemplating relinquishment ... (32) When he knows unification of mind
and non-distraction by means of breathing out contemplating
relinquishment, mindfulness is established in him; owing to that
mindfulness and that knowledge he is a mindful worker" (Paṭis I 176).



[164.] Herein,  *breathing in long* (*assasanto*) is producing
a long in-breath. \[272\] "*Assāsa * is the wind issuing out; *passāsa *
is the wind entering in" is said in the Vinaya Commentary. But in the
Suttanta Commentaries it is given in the opposite sense. Herein, when
any infant comes out from the mother's womb, first the wind from within
goes out and subsequently the wind from without enters in with fine
dust, strikes the palate and is extinguished \[with the infant's
sneezing\]. This, firstly, is how *assāsa * and  *passāsa * should be
understood.



[165.] But their length and shortness should be understood by
extent (*addhāna*). For just as water or sand that occupies an extent of
space is called a "long water," a "long sand," a "short water," a "short
sand," so in the case of elephants' and snakes' bodies the in-breaths
and out-breaths regarded as particles45 slowly fill the long extent, in
other words, their persons, and slowly go out again. That is why they
are called "long." They rapidly fill a short extent, in other words, the
person of a dog, a hare, etc., and rapidly go out again. That is why
they are called "short."



[166.] And in the case of human beings some breathe in and
breathe out long, by extent of time, as elephants, snakes, etc., do,
while others breathe in and breathe out short in that way as dogs,
hares, etc., do. Of these, therefore, the breaths that travel over a
long extent in entering in and going out are to be understood as long in
time; and the breaths that travel over a little extent in entering in
and going out, as short in time.



[167.] Now, this bhikkhu knows "I breathe in, I breathe out,
long" while breathing in and breathing out long in nine ways. And the
development of the foundation of mindfulness consisting in contemplation
of the body should be understood to be perfected in one aspect in him
who knows thus, according as it is said in the Paṭisambhidā:



44\. The amplification is from Vism-mhṭ 258.\



45\. "'Regarded as particles': as a number of groups (*kalāpa*)"
(Vism-mhṭ 259). This conception of the occurrence of breaths is based on
the theory of motion as "successive arisings in adjacent locations"
(*desantaruppatti*); see note 54 below. For "groups" see XX.2f.



[]



[]



[168.] "How, breathing in long, does he know: 'I breathe in
long,' breathing out long, does he know: 'I breathe out long?' (1) He
breathes in a long in-breath reckoned as an extent. (2) He breathes out
a long out-breath reckoned as an extent. (3) He breathes in and breathes
out long in-breaths and out-breaths reckoned as an extent. As he
breathes in and breathes out long in-breaths and out-breaths reckoned as
an extent, zeal arises.46 (4) Through zeal he breathes in a long
in-breath more subtle than before reckoned as an extent. (5) Through
zeal he breathes out a long out-breath more subtle than before reckoned
as an extent. (6) Through zeal he breathes in and breathes out long
in-breaths and out-breaths more subtle than before reckoned as an
extent. As, through zeal, he breathes in and breathes out long
in-breaths and out-breaths more subtle than before reckoned as an
extent, gladness arises. \[273\] (7) Through gladness he breathes in a
long in-breath more subtle than before reckoned as an extent. (8)
Through gladness he breathes out a long out-breath more subtle than
before reckoned as an extent. (9) Through gladness he breathes in and
breathes out long in-breaths and out-breaths more subtle than before
reckoned as an extent. As, through gladness, he breathes in and breathes
out long in-breaths and out-breaths more subtle than before reckoned as
an extent, his mind turns away from the long in- breaths and out-breaths
and equanimity is established.



"Long in-breaths and out-breaths in these nine ways are a body. The



establishment (foundation)47 is mindfulness. The contemplation is
knowledge.



46\. "'Zeal arises': additional zeal, which is profitable and has the
characteristic of desire to act, arises due to the satisfaction obtained
when the meditation has brought progressive improvement. 'More subtle
than before': more subtle than before the already-described zeal arose;
for the breaths occur more subtly owing to the meditation's influence in
tranquilizing the body's distress and disturbance. 'Gladness arises':
fresh happiness arises of the kinds classed as minor, etc., which is the
gladness that accompanies the consciousness occupied with the meditation
and is due to the fact that the peacefulness of the object increases
with the growing subtlety of the breaths and to the fact that the
meditation subject keeps to its course. 'The mind turns away': the mind
turns away from the breaths, which have reached the point at which their
manifestation needs investigating (see §177) owing to their gradually
increasing subtlety. But some say (see Paṭis-a Ce, p. 351): 'It is when
the in-breaths and out- breaths have reached a subtler state owing to
the influence of the meditation and the counterpart sign; for when that
has arisen, the mind turns away from the normal breaths.' 'Equanimity is
established': when concentration, classed as access and absorption, has
arisen in that counterpart sign, then, since there is no need for
further interest to achieve jhāna, onlooking (equanimity) ensues, which
is specific neutrality" (Vism-mhṭ 260).\



47\. "'In these nine ways': that occur in the nine ways just described.
'Long in-breaths and out-breaths are a body': the in-breaths and
out-breaths, which exist as particles though they have the aspect of
length, constitute a 'body' in the sense of a mass. And here the sign
that arises with the breaths as its support is also called 'in-breath
and out-breath.' (cf. e.g. §206) 'The establishment (foundation) is
mindfulness': mindfulness is called 'establishment
(foundation)---(*upaṭṭhāna*)' since it approaches (*upagantvā*) the
object and remains (*tiṭṭhati*) there. 'The contemplation is knowledge':
contemplation



[]



[]



The body is the establishment (foundation), but it is not the
mindfulness. Mindfulness is both the establishment (foundation) and the
mindfulness. By means of that mindfulness and that knowledge he
contemplates that body. That is why 'development of the foundation
(establishment) of mindfulness consisting in contemplation of the body
as a body' (see D II 290) is said" (Paṭis I 177).



[169.] (ii) The same method of explanation applies also in the
case of *short* breaths. But there is this difference. While in the
former case "a long in-breath reckoned as an extent" is said, here "a
short in-breath reckoned as a little



of the sign by means of serenity, and contemplation of
mentality-materiality by defining with insight the in-breaths and
out-breaths and the body, which is their support, as materiality, and
the consciousness and the states associated with it as the immaterial
(mentality), are knowledge, in other words, awareness of what is
actually there (has actually become). 'The body is the establishment
(foundation)': there is that body, and mindfulness approaches it by
making it its object and remains there, thus it is called
'establishment.' And the words 'the body is the establishment' include
the other (the mental) kind of body too since the above-mentioned
comprehension by insight is needed here too. 'But it is not the
mindfulness': that body is not called 'mindfulness' \[though it is
called 'the establishment'\]. 'Mindfulness is both the establishment
(foundation) and the mindfulness,' being so both in the sense of
remembering (*sarana*) and in the sense of establishing (*upatiṭṭhana*).
'By means of that mindfulness': by means of that mindfulness already
mentioned. 'And that knowledge': and the knowledge already mentioned.
'That body': that in-breath-and-out-breath body and that material body
which is its support. 'He contemplates (*anupassati*)': he keeps re-
seeing (*anu anu passati*) with jhāna knowledge and with insight
knowledge. 'That is why "Development of the foundation (establishment)
of mindfulness consisting in contemplation of the body as a body" is
said': in virtue of that contemplation this is said to be development of
the foundation (establishment) of mindfulness consisting in
contemplation of the body as a body of the kind already stated. What is
meant is this: the contemplation of the body as an
in-breath-and-out-breath body as stated and of the physical body that is
its \[material\] support, which is not contemplation of permanence,
etc., in a body whose individual essence is impermanent, etc.---like the
contemplation of a waterless mirage as water---but which is rather
contemplation of its essence as impermanent, painful, not-self, and
foul, according as is appropriate, or alternatively, which is
contemplation of it as a mere body only, by not contemplating it as
containing anything that can be apprehended as 'I' or 'mine' or 'woman'
or 'man'--- all this is 'contemplation of the body.' The mindfulness
associated with that contemplation of the body, which mindfulness is
itself the establishment, is the 'establishment.' The development, the
increase, of that is the 'development of the foundation (establishment)
of mindfulness consisting in contemplation of the body.'" (Vism-mhṭ
261)\
The compound *satipaṭṭhāna* is derived by the Paṭisambhidā from *sati*
(mindfulness) and  *upaṭṭhāna* (establishment---Paṭis I 182), but in the
Commentaries the resolution into *sati* and *paṭṭhāna* (foundation) is
preferred. (M-a I 237--38) In the 118th Sutta of the Majjhima Nikāya the
first tetrad is called development of the first foundation of
mindfulness, or contemplation of the body. (MN 10; DN 22) The object of
the Paṭisambhidā passage quoted is to demonstrate this.



[]



[]



\[duration\]" (Paṭis I 182) is given. So it must be construed as "short"
as far as the phrase "That is why 'development of the foundation
(establishment) of mindfulness consisting in contemplation of the body
as a body' is said" (Paṭis I 183).



[170.] So it should be understood that it is when this bhikkhu
knows in-breaths and out-breaths in these nine ways as "a \[long\]
extent" and as "a little \[duration\]" that "breathing in long, he knows
'I breathe in long;' ... breathing out short, he knows 'I breathe out
short' is said of him. And when he knows thus:



"The long kind and the short as well,\
The in-breath and the out-breath too,\
Such then are the four kinds that happen\
At the bhikkhu's nose tip here."



[171.](iii)  *He trains thus:* "*I shall breathe in ... I shall
breathe out experiencing the whole body*": he trains thus: "I shall
breathe in making known, making plain, the beginning, middle and end48
of the entire in-breath body. I shall breathe out making known, making
plain, the beginning, middle and end of the entire out- breath body,"
thus he trains. Making them known, making them plain, in this way he
both breathes in and breathes out with consciousness associated with
knowledge. That is why it is said, "He trains thus: 'I shall breathe in
... shall breathe out ...'"



[172.] To one bhikkhu the beginning of the in-breath body or
the out-breath body, distributed in particles, \[that is to say,
regarded as successive arisings (see note 45)\] is plain, but not the
middle or the end; he is only able to discern the beginning and has
difficulty with the middle and the end. To another the middle is plain,
not the beginning or the end; he is only able to discern the middle and
has difficulty with the beginning and the end. To another the end is
plain, not the beginning or the middle; he is only able to discern the
end \[274\] and has difficulty with the beginning and the middle. To yet
another all stages are plain; he is able to discern them all and has no
difficulty with any of them. Pointing out that one should be like the
last-mentioned bhikkhu, he said: "He trains thus: 'I shall breathe in
... shall breathe out experiencing the whole body.'"



[173.] Herein, *he trains*: he strives, he endeavours in this
way. Or else the restraint here in one such as this is training in the
higher virtue, his consciousness is training in the higher
consciousness, and his understanding is training in the higher
understanding (see Paṭis I 184). So he trains in, repeats, develops,
repeatedly practices, these three kinds of training, on that object, by
means of that mindfulness, by means of that attention. This is how the
meaning should be regarded here.



48\. The beginning, middle and end are described in §197, and the way
they should be treated is given in §199--201. What is meant is that the
meditator should know what they are and be aware of them without his
mindfulness leaving the tip of the nose to follow after the breaths
inside the body or outside it, speculating on what becomes of them.



[]



[]



[174.] Herein, in the first part of the system (nos. i and
ii)49 he should only breathe in and breathe out and not do anything else
at all, and it is only afterwards that he should apply himself to the
arousing of knowledge, and so on. Consequently the present tense is used
here in the text, "He knows: 'I breathe in' ... he knows: 'I breathe
out.'" But the future tense in the passage beginning "I shall breathe in
experiencing the whole body" should be understood as used in order to
show that the aspect of arousing knowledge, etc., has to be undertaken
from then on.



[175.](iv) He trains thus: "I shall breathe in ... shall
breathe out tranquilizing the bodily formation;" he trains thus: "I
shall breathe in, shall breathe out tranquilizing, completely
tranquilizing, stopping, stilling, the gross bodily formation50".



[176.] And here both the gross and subtle state and also
\[progressive\] tranquilizing should be understood. For previously, at
the time when the bhikkhu has still not discerned \[the meditation
subject\], his body and his mind are disturbed and so they are gross.
And while the grossness of the body and the mind has still not subsided
the in-breaths and out-breaths are gross. They get stronger; his
nostrils become inadequate, and he keeps breathing in and out through
his mouth. But they become quiet and still when his body and mind have
been discerned. When they are still then the in-breaths and out-breaths
occur so subtly that he has to investigate whether they exist or not.



[177.] Suppose a man stands still after running, or descending
from a hill, or putting down a big load from his head, then his
in-breaths and out-breaths are gross, his nostrils become inadequate,
and he keeps on breathing in and out through his mouth. But when he has
rid himself of his fatigue and has bathed and drunk \[275\] and put a
wet cloth on his heart, and is lying in the cool shade, then his
in-breaths and out-breaths eventually occur so subtly that he has to
investigate whether they exist or not; so too, previously, at the time
when the bhikkhu has still not discerned, ... he has to investigate
whether they exist or not.



[178.] Why is that? Because previously, at the time when he has
still not discerned, there is no concern in him, no reaction, no
attention, no reviewing, to the effect that "I am \[progressively\]
tranquilizing each grosser bodily formation." But when he has discerned,
there is. So his bodily formation at the time when he has



49\. "'In the first part of the system': in the first part of the system
of development; in the first two bases, is what is intended. Of course,
arousing of knowledge must be admitted to take place here too because of
the presence of awareness of the length and shortness of the breaths as
they actually are (as they actually become); and it is not hard to do
that, for it is merely the taking account of them as they occur. That is
why it is put in the present tense here. But what follows is as hard as
for a man to walk on a razor's edge; which is why the future tense is
used for the subsequent stages in order to indicate the need for
exceptional prior effort" (Vism-mhṭ 263).



50\. "'Bodily formation': the in-breath and out-breath (see M I 301).
For although it is consciousness-originated, it is nevertheless called
'bodily formation' since its existence is bound up with the kamma-born
body and it is formed with that as the means" (Vism-mhṭ 263).

discerned is subtle in comparison with that at the time when he has not.
Hence the Ancients said:



"The mind and body are disturbed,\
And then in excess it occurs;\
But when the body is undisturbed,\
Then it with subtlety occurs."



[179.]In discerning \[the meditation subject the formation\] is
gross, and it is subtle \[by comparison\] in the first-jhāna access;
also it is gross in that, and subtle \[by comparison\] in the first
jhāna; in the first jhāna and second-jhāna access it is gross, and in
the second jhāna subtle; in the second jhāna and third-jhāna access it
is gross, and in the third jhāna subtle; in the third jhāna and
fourth-jhāna access it is gross, and in the fourth jhāna it is so
exceedingly subtle that it even reaches cessation. This is the opinion
of the Dīgha and Saṃyutta reciters. But the Majjhima reciters have it
that it is subtler in each access than in the jhāna below too in this
way: In the first jhāna it is gross, and in the second-jhāna access it
is subtle \[by comparison, and so on\]. It is, however, the opinion of
all that the bodily formation occurring before the time of discerning
becomes tranquilized at the time of discerning, and the bodily formation
at the time of discerning becomes tranquilized in the first-jhāna access
... and the bodily formation occurring in the fourth-jhāna access
becomes tranquilized in the fourth jhāna. This is the method of
explanation in the case of serenity.



[180.] But in the case of insight, the bodily formation
occurring at the time of not discerning is gross, and in discerning the
primary elements it is \[by comparison\] subtle; that also is gross, and
in discerning derived materiality it is subtle; that also is gross, and
in discerning all materiality it is subtle; that also is gross, and in
discerning the immaterial it is subtle; that also is gross, and in
discerning the material and immaterial it is subtle; that also is gross,
and in discerning conditions it is subtle; that also is gross, and in
seeing mentality-materiality with its conditions it is subtle; that also
is gross, and in insight that has the characteristics \[of impermanence,
etc.,\] as its object it is subtle; that also is gross in weak insight
while in strong insight it is subtle.



Herein, the tranquilizing should be understood as \[the relative
tranquillity\] of the subsequent compared with the previous. Thus should
the gross and subtle state, and the \[progressive\] tranquilizing, be
understood here. \[276\]



[181.] But the meaning of this is given in the Paṭisambhidā
together with the objection and clarification thus:



"How is it that he trains thus: 'I shall breathe in ... shall breathe
out tranquilizing the bodily formation? What are the bodily formations?
Long in- breaths ... out-breaths \[experiencing the whole body\] belong
to the body; these things, being bound up with the body, are bodily
formations;' he trains in tranquilizing, stopping, stilling, those
bodily formations.



"When there are such bodily formations whereby there is bending
backwards, sideways in all directions, and forwards, and perturbation,
vacillation, moving and shaking of the body, he trains thus: 'I shall
breathe in tranquilizing the bodily formation;' he trains thus: 'I shall
breathe out tranquilizing the bodily

formation.' When there are such bodily formations whereby there is no
bending backwards, sideways in all directions, and forwards, and no
perturbation, vacillation, moving and shaking of the body, quietly,
subtly, he trains thus: 'I shall breathe in tranquilizing the bodily
formation;' he trains thus: 'I shall breathe out tranquilizing the
bodily formation.'



[182.] "\[Objection:\] So then, he trains thus: 'I shall
breathe in tranquilizing the bodily formation;' he trains thus: 'I shall
breathe out tranquilizing the bodily formation': that being so, there is
no production of awareness of wind, and there is no production of
in-breaths and out-breaths, and there is no production of mindfulness of
breathing, and there is no production of concentration through
mindfulness of breathing, and consequently the wise neither enter into
nor emerge from that attainment.



[183.] "\[Clarification:\] So then, he trains thus: 'I shall
breathe in tranquilizing the bodily formation;' he trains thus: 'I shall
breathe out tranquilizing the bodily formation': that being so, there is
production of awareness of wind, and there is production of in-breaths
and out-breaths, and there is production of mindfulness of breathing,
and there is production of concentration through mindfulness of
breathing, and consequently the wise enter into and emerge from that
attainment.



[184.] "Like what? Just as when a gong is struck. At first
gross sounds occur and consciousness \[occurs\] because the sign of the
gross sounds is well apprehended, well attended to, well observed; and
when the gross sounds have ceased, then afterwards faint sounds occur
and \[consciousness occurs\] because the sign of the faint sounds is
well apprehended, well attended to, well observed; and when the faint
sounds have ceased, then \[277\] afterwards consciousness occurs because
it has the sign of the faint sounds as its object51---so too, at first
gross in-breaths and out-breaths occur and \[consciousness does not
become distracted\] because the sign of the gross in-breaths and
out-breaths is well apprehended, well attended to, well observed; and
when the gross in-breaths and out-breaths have ceased, then afterwards
faint in-breaths and out-breaths occur and \[consciousness does not
become distracted\] because the sign of the faint in-breaths and
out-breaths is well apprehended, well attended to, well observed; and
when the faint in-breaths and out-breaths have ceased, then afterwards
consciousness does not become distracted because it has the sign of the
faint in-breaths and out-breaths as its object.



"That being so, there is production of awareness of wind, and there is
production of in-breaths and out-breaths, and there is production of
mindfulness of breathing, and there is production of concentration
through mindfulness of breathing, and consequently the wise enter into
and emerge from that attainment.



51\. "The faint sound itself as a sign is the 'sign of the faint
sounds'; it has that as its object. What is meant? Of course, the faint
sounds have ceased too then; but the sign of the sounds has been well
apprehended and so consciousness occurs with the sign of fainter sounds
as its object. For as from the outset he ascertains with undistracted
consciousness the sign of each sound as it ceases, eventually his
consciousness occurs in the end with the sign of ultra-subtle sounds too
as its object" (Vism-mhṭ 266).

[185.] "In-breaths and out-breaths tranquilizing the bodily
formation are a body. The establishment (foundation) is mindfulness. The
contemplation is knowledge. The body is the establishment (foundation),
but it is not the mindfulness. Mindfulness is both the establishment
(foundation) and the mindfulness. By means of that mindfulness and that
knowledge he contemplates that body. That is why 'development of the
foundation (establishment) of mindfulness consisting in contemplation of
the body as a body' is said" (Paṭis I 184--186).



This, in the first place, is the consecutive word commentary here on the
first



tetrad, which deals with contemplation of the body.



\[Method of Development\]



[186.] The first tetrad is set forth as a meditation subject
for a beginner;52 but the other three tetrads are \[respectively\] set
forth as the contemplations of feeling, of \[the manner of\]
consciousness, and of mental objects, for one who has already attained
jhāna in this tetrad. So if a clansman who is a beginner wants to
develop this meditation subject, and through insight based on the fourth
jhāna produced in breathing, to reach Arahantship together with the
discriminations, he should first do all the work connected with the
purification of virtue, etc., in the way already described, after which
he should learn the meditation subject in five stages from a teacher of
the kind already described.



[187.] Here are the five stages: learning, questioning,
establishing, absorption, characteristic.



Herein, *learning* is learning the meditation subject. *Questioning* is
questioning about the meditation subject. *Establishing* is establishing
the meditation subject. *Absorption* \[278\] is the absorption of the
meditation subject. *Characteristic* is the characteristic of the
meditation subject; what is meant is that it is the ascertaining of the
meditation subject's individual essence thus: "This meditation subject
has such a characteristic."



[188.] Learning the meditation subject in the five stages in
this way, he neither tires himself nor worries the teacher. So in giving
this meditation subject consisting in mindfulness of breathing
attention, he can live either with the teacher or elsewhere in an abode
of the kind already described, learning the meditation subject in the
five stages thus, getting a little expounded at a time and taking a long
time over reciting it. He should sever the minor impediments. After
finishing the work connected with the meal and getting rid of any
dizziness due to the meal, he should seat himself comfortably. Then,
making sure he is not confused about even a single word of what he has
learned from the teacher, he should cheer his mind by recollecting the
special qualities of the Three Jewels.



52\. "As a meditation subject for a beginner" is said with reference to
the serenity (i.e. jhāna) meditation subject; but the insight meditation
subject applies to the other tetrads too" (Vism-mhṭ 266).



[]



[]



[189.] Here are the stages in giving attention to it: (1)
counting, (2) connection, (3) touching, (4) fixing, (5) observing, (6)
turning away, (7) purification, and (8) looking back on these.



Herein,  *counting * is just counting, *connection * is carrying on,
*touching * is the place touched \[by the breaths\], *fixing* is
absorption, *observing* is insight, *turning away * is the path,
*purification * is fruition, *looking back on these* is reviewing.



[190.] *1.* Herein, this clansman who is a beginner should
first give attention to this meditation subject by counting. And when
counting, he should not stop short of five or go beyond ten or make any
break in the series. By stopping short of five his thoughts get excited
in the cramped space, like a herd of cattle shut in a cramped pen. By
going beyond ten his thoughts take the number \[rather than the
breaths\] for their support. By making a break in the series he wonders
if the meditation subject has reached completion or not. So he should do
his counting without those faults.



[191.] When counting, he should at first do it slowly \[that
is, late\] as a grain measurer does. For a grain measurer, having filled
his measure, says "One," and empties it, and then refilling it, he goes
on saying '"One, one" while removing any rubbish he may have noticed.
And the same with "Two, two" and so on. So, taking the in-breath or the
out-breath, whichever appears \[most plainly\], he should begin with
"One, one" \[279\] and count up to "Ten, ten," noting each as it occurs.



[192.] As he does his counting in this way, the in-breaths and
out-breaths become evident to him as they enter in and issue out. Then
he can leave off counting slowly (late), like a grain measurer, and he
can count quickly \[that is, early\] as a cowherd does. For a skilled
cowherd takes pebbles in his pocket and goes to the cow pen in the
morning, whip in hand; sitting on the bar of the gate, prodding the cows
in the back, he counts each one as it reaches the gate, saying "One,
two," dropping a pebble for each. And the cows of the herd, which have
been spending the three watches of the night uncomfortably in the
cramped space, come out quickly in parties, jostling each other as they
escape. So he counts quickly (early) "Three, four, five" and so up to
ten. In this way the in-breaths and out-breaths, which had already
become evident to him while he counted them in the former way, now keep
moving along quickly.



[193.] Then, knowing that they keep moving along quickly, not
apprehending them either inside or outside \[the body\], but
apprehending them just as they reach the \[nostril\] door, he can do his
counting quickly (early): "One, two, three, four, five; one, two, three,
four, five, six ... seven ... eight ... nine ... ten." For as long as
the meditation subject is connected with counting it is with the help of
that very counting that the mind becomes unified, just as a boat in a
swift current is steadied with the help of a rudder.



[194.] When he counts quickly, the meditation subject becomes
apparent to him as an uninterrupted process. Then, knowing that it is
proceeding uninterruptedly, he can count quickly (early) in the way just
described, not discerning the wind either inside or outside \[the
body\]. For by bringing his consciousness inside along with the incoming
breath, it seems as if it were buffeted by the wind inside



[]



[]



or filled with fat.53 By taking his consciousness outside along with the
outgoing breath, it gets distracted by the multiplicity of objects
outside. However, his development is successful when he fixes his
mindfulness on the place touched \[by the breaths\]. That is why it was
said above: "He can count quickly (early) in the way just described, not
discerning the wind either inside or outside."



[195.] But how long is he to go on counting? Until, without
counting, \[280\] mindfulness remains settled on the in-breaths and
out-breaths as its object. For counting is simply a device for setting
mindfulness on the in-breaths and out- breaths as object by cutting off
the external dissipation of applied thoughts.



[196.] *2.* Having given attention to it in this way by
counting, he should now do so by *connection*. *Connection* is the
uninterrupted following of the in-breaths and out-breaths with
mindfulness after counting has been given up. And that is not by
following after the beginning, the middle and the end.54



[197.] The navel is the beginning of the wind issuing out, the
heart is its middle and the nose-tip is its end. The nose-tip is the
beginning of the wind entering in, the heart is its middle and the navel
is its end. And if he follows after that, his mind is distracted by
disquiet and perturbation according as it is said: "When he goes in with
mindfulness after the beginning, middle, and end of the in- breath, his
mind being distracted internally, both his body and his mind are
disquieted and perturbed and shaky. When he goes out with mindfulness
after the beginning, middle and end of the out-breath, his mind being
distracted externally, both his body and his mind are disquieted and
perturbed and shaky" (Paṭis I 165).



*3--4.* So when he gives his attention to it by connection, he should do
so not by



the beginning, middle and end, but rather by *touching* and by *fixing*.



[198.] There is no attention to be given to it by touching
separate from fixing as there is by counting separate from connection.
But when he is counting the breaths in the place touched by each, he is
giving attention to them by counting



53\. "'Buffeted by wind': if he gives much attention to the wind that
has gone inside, that place seems to him as if it were buffeted by the
wind, as if filled with fat" (Vism- mhṭ 268). No further explanation is
given.\



54\. "'Following (*anugamana*)' is occurring along with (*anu anu
pavattana*), going after (*anugacchana*), by means of mindfulness
through making the breaths the object as they occur, Hence he said, 'And
that is not by following after the beginning, middle and end.' 'The
navel is the beginning' because of their first arising there. For the
notion of a beginning (*ādi cintā*) is here in the sense of first
arising, not in the sense of just arising \[once only\]. For they
actually go on arising throughout \[the whole length\] from the navel to
the nose-tip; and wherever they arise, there in that same place they
dissolve, because there is no going (movement) of dhammas. The ordinary
term 'motion' (*gatisamaññā*) refers to successive arisings in adjacent
locations (*desantaruppatti*) according to conditions. 'The heart is the
middle': near the heart, just above it is the middle. 'The nose tip is
the end': the place where the nostrils are is the end; that is the limit
of the application of the ordinary term 'in-breaths and out- breaths,'
for it is accordingly that they are called 'consciousness-originated,'
there being no production externally of what is
consciousness-originated" (Vism-mhṭ 268).

and touching. When he has given up counting and is connecting them by
means of mindfulness in that same place and fixing consciousness by
means of absorption, then he is said to be giving his attention to them
by connection, touching and fixing. And the meaning of this may be
understood through the similes of the man who cannot walk and the
gatekeeper given in the commentaries, and through the simile of the saw
given in the Paṭisambhidā.



[199.] Here is the simile of the man who cannot walk: Just as a
man unable to walk, who is rocking a swing for the amusement of his
children and their mother, sits at the foot of the swing post and sees
both ends and the middle of the swing plank successively coming and
going, \[281\] yet does not move from his place in order to see both
ends and the middle, so too, when a bhikkhu places himself with
mindfulness, as it were, at the foot of the post for anchoring
\[mindfulness\] and rocks the swing of the in-breaths and out-breaths;
he sits down with mindfulness on the sign at that same place, and
follows with mindfulness the beginning, middle and end of the in-breaths
and out-breaths at the place touched by them as they come and go;
keeping his mind fixed there, he then sees them without moving from his
place in order to see them. This is the simile of the man who cannot
walk.



[200.] This is the simile of the gatekeeper: Just as a
gatekeeper does not examine people inside and outside the town, asking,
"Who are you? Where have you come from? Where are you going? What have
you got in your hand?"---for those people are not his concern---but he
does examine each man as he arrives at the gate, so too, the incoming
breaths that have gone inside and the outgoing breaths that have gone
outside are not this bhikkhu's concern, but they are his concern each
time they arrive at the \[nostril\] gate itself.



[201.] Then the simile of the saw should be understood from its
beginning. For this is said:



"Sign, in-breath, out-breath, are not object\
Of a single consciousness;\
By one who knows not these three things\
Development is not obtained.\
"Sign, in-breath, out-breath, are not object\
Of a single consciousness;\
By one who does know these three things\
Development can be obtained."



[202.] "How is it that these three things are not the object of
a single consciousness, that they are nevertheless not unknown, that the
mind does not become distracted, that he manifests effort, carries out a
task, and achieves an effect?



"Suppose there were a tree trunk placed on a level piece of ground, and
a man cut it with a saw. The man's mindfulness is established by the
saw's teeth where they touch the tree trunk, without his giving
attention to the saw's teeth as they approach and recede, though they
are not unknown to him as they do so; and he manifests effort, carries
out a task, and achieves an effect. As the tree trunk placed on the
level piece of ground, so the sign for the anchoring of mindfulness.



[]



[]



As the saw's teeth, so the in-breaths and out-breaths. As the man's
mindfulness, established by the saw's teeth where they touch the tree
trunk, without his giving attention to the saw's teeth as they approach
and recede, though they are not unknown to him as they do so, and so he
manifests effort, carries out a task, and achieves an effect, \[282\] so
too, the bhikkhu sits, having established mindfulness at the nose tip or
on the upper lip, without giving attention to the in-breaths and
out-breaths as they approach and recede, though they are not unknown to
him as they do so, and he manifests effort, carries out a task, and
achieves an effect.



[203.]"'Effort': what is the effort? The body and the mind of
one who is energetic become wieldy---this is the effort. What is the
task? Imperfections come to be abandoned in one who is energetic, and
his applied thoughts are stilled---this is the task. What is the effect?
Fetters come to be abandoned in one who is energetic, and his inherent
tendencies come to be done away with---this is the effect.



"So these three things are not the object of a single consciousness, and
they are nevertheless not unknown, and the mind does not become
distracted, and he manifests effort, carries out a task, and achieves an
effect.



"Whose mindfulness of breathing in\
And out is perfect, well developed,\
And gradually brought to growth\
According as the Buddha taught,\
'Tis he illuminates the world\
Just like the full moon free from cloud"55



This is the simile of the saw. But here it is precisely his not giving
attention \[to the breaths\] as \[yet to\] come and \[already\] gone56
that should be understood as the purpose.



[204.] When someone gives his attention to this meditation
subject, sometimes it is not long before the sign arises in him, and
then the *fixing*, in other words, absorption adorned with the rest of
the jhāna factors, is achieved.



[205.] After someone has given his attention to counting, then
just as when a body that is disturbed sits down on a bed or chair, the
bed or chair sags down and creaks and the cover gets rumpled, but when a
body that is not disturbed sits down, the bed or chair neither sags down
nor creaks, the cover does not get rumpled, and it is as though filled
with cotton wool---why? because a body that is not disturbed is
light---so too, after he has given his attention to counting, when the
bodily disturbance has been stilled by the gradual cessation of gross
in-breaths and out-breaths, then both the body and the mind become
light: the physical body is as though it were ready to leap up into the
air. \[283\]



[206.] When his gross in-breaths and out breaths have ceased,
his consciousness occurs with the sign of the subtle in-breaths and
out-breaths as its object. And when that has ceased, it goes on
occurring with the successively subtler signs as its object. How?

56\. Reading *āgata-gata-vasena* with Vism-mhṭ 271.



[]



[]



[207.] Suppose a man stuck a bronze bell with a big iron bar
and at once a loud sound arose, his consciousness would occur with the
gross sound as its object; then, when the gross sound had ceased, it
would occur afterwards with the sign of the subtle sound as its object;
and when that had ceased, it would go on occurring with the sign of the
successively subtler sounds as its object. This is how it should be
understood. And this is given in detail in the passage beginning, "Just
as when a metal gong is struck" (§184).



[208.]For while other meditation subjects become clearer at
each higher stage, this one does not: in fact, as he goes on developing
it, it becomes more subtle for him at each higher stage, and it even
comes to the point at which it is no longer manifest.



However, when it becomes unmanifest in this way, the bhikkhu should not
get up from his seat, shake out his leather mat, and go away. What
should be done? He should not get up with the idea "Shall I ask the
teacher?" or "Is my meditation subject lost?"; for by going away, and so
disturbing his posture, the meditation subject has to be started anew.
So he should go on sitting as he was and \[temporarily\] substitute the
place \[normally touched for the actual breaths as the object of
contemplation\].57



[209.] These are the means for doing it. The bhikkhu should
recognize the unmanifest state of the meditation subject and consider
thus: "Where do these in-breaths and out-breaths exist? Where do they
not? In whom do they exist? In whom not?" Then, as he considers thus, he
finds that they do not exist in one inside the mother's womb, or in
those drowned in water, or likewise in unconscious beings,58 or in the
dead, or in those attained to the fourth jhāna, or in those born into a
fine-material or immaterial existence, or in those attained to cessation
\[of perception and feeling\]. So he should apostrophize himself thus:
"You with all your wisdom are certainly not inside a mother's womb or
drowned in water or in the unconscious existence or dead or attained to
the fourth jhāna or born into the fine-material or immaterial existence
or attained to cessation. Those in-breaths and out-breath are actually
existent in you, only you are not able to discern them because your
understanding is dull." Then, fixing his mind on the place normally
touched \[by the breaths\], he should proceed to give his attention to
that.



[210.] These in-breaths and out-breaths occur striking the tip
of the nose in a long-nosed man \[284\] and the upper lip in a
short-nosed man. So he should fix the sign thus: "This is the place
where they strike." This was why the Blessed One said: "Bhikkhus, I do
not say of one who is forgetful, who is not fully aware, \[that he
practices\] development of mindfulness of breathing" (M III 84).



57\. The point made here is that if the breaths themselves get
temporarily too faint to be observed, he should carry on by observing
the tip of the nose where they normally touch until they become apparent
again. He brings the meditation back to mind for the moment, "as the
place (*desato*)" where they were last noticed, instead of "as breaths,"
which have temporarily vanished.\



58\. Those born in the world of unconscious beings in the fine-material
Brahmā world (D I 28).

[]



[211.] Although any meditation subject, no matter what, is
successful only in one who is mindful and fully aware, yet any
meditation subject other than this one gets more evident as he goes on
giving it his attention. But this mindfulness of breathing is difficult,
difficult to develop, a field in which only the minds of Buddhas,
Paccekabuddhas, and Buddhas' sons are at home. It is no trivial matter,
nor can it be cultivated by trivial persons. In proportion as continued
attention is given to it, it becomes more peaceful and more subtle. So
strong mindfulness and understanding are necessary here.



[212.] Just as when doing needlework on a piece of fine cloth a
fine needle is needed, and a still finer instrument for boring the
needle's eye, so too, when developing this meditation subject, which
resembles fine cloth, both the mindfulness, which is the counterpart of
the needle, and the understanding associated with it, which is the
counterpart of the instrument for boring the needle's eye, need to be
strong. A bhikkhu must have the necessary mindfulness and understanding
and must look for the in-breaths and out-breaths nowhere else than the
place normally touched by them.



[213.]Suppose a ploughman, after doing some ploughing, sent his
oxen free to graze and sat down to rest in the shade, then his oxen
would soon go into the forest. Now, a skilled ploughman who wants to
catch them and yoke them again does not wander through the forest
following their tracks, but rather he takes his rope and goad and goes
straight to the drinking place where they meet, and he sits or lies
there. Then after the oxen have wandered about for a part of the day,
they come to the drinking place where they meet and they bathe and
drink, and when he sees that they have come out and are standing about,
he secures them with the rope, and prodding them with the goad, he
brings them back, yokes them, and goes on with his ploughing. So too,
the bhikkhu should not look for the in-breaths and out- breaths anywhere
else than the place normally touched by them. And he should take the
rope of mindfulness and the goad of understanding, and fixing his mind
on the place normally touched by them, he should go on giving his
attention to that. \[285\] For as he gives his attention in this way
they reappear after no long time, as the oxen did at the drinking place
where they met. So he can secure them with the rope of mindfulness, and
yoking them in that same place and prodding them with the goad of
understanding, he can keep on applying himself to the meditation
subject.



[214.] When he does so in this way, the sign59 soon appears to
him. But it is not the same for all; on the contrary, some say that when
it appears it does so to certain people producing a light touch like
cotton or silk-cotton or a draught.



[215.] But this is the exposition given in the commentaries: It
appears to some like a star or a cluster of gems or a cluster of pearls,
to others with a rough touch like that of silk-cotton seeds or a peg
made of heartwood, to others like a long braid string or a wreath of
flowers or a puff of smoke, to others like a stretched-



59\. "'The sign' is the learning sign and the counterpart sign, for both
are stated here together. Herein, the three similes beginning with
cotton are properly the learning sign, the rest are both. 'Some' are
certain teachers. The similes beginning with the 'cluster of gems' are
properly the counterpart sign" (Vism-mhṭ 273).

out cobweb or a film of cloud or a lotus flower or a chariot wheel or
the moon's disk or the sun's disk.



[216.] In fact this resembles an occasion when a number of
bhikkhus are sitting together reciting a suttanta. When a bhikkhu asks,
"What does this sutta appear like to you?" one says, "It appears to me
like a great mountain torrent," another "To me it is like a line of
forest trees," another "To me it is like a spreading fruit tree giving
cool shade." For the one sutta appears to them differently because of
the difference in their perception. Similarly this single meditation
subject appears differently because of difference in perception.60 It is
born of perception, its source is perception, it is produced by
perception. Therefore it should be understood that when it appears
differently it is because of difference in perception.



[217.] And here, the consciousness that has in-breath as its
object is one, the consciousness that has out-breath as its object is
another, and the consciousness that has the sign as its object is
another. For the meditation subject reaches neither absorption nor even
access in one who has not got these three things \[clear\]. But it
reaches access and also absorption in one who has got these three things
\[clear\]. For this is said:



"Sign, in-breath, out-breath, are not object\
Of a single consciousness;\
By one who knows not these three things\
Development is not obtained.



Sign, in-breath, out-breath, are not object\
Of a single consciousness;\
By one who does know these three things\
Development can be obtained" (Paṭis I 170). \[286\]



[218.] And when the sign has appeared in this way, the bhikkhu
should go to the teacher and tell him, "Venerable sir, such and such has
appeared to me." But \[say the Dīgha reciters\] the teacher should say
neither "This is the sign" nor "This is not the sign"; after saying "It
happens like this, friend," he should tell him, "Go on giving it
attention again and again;" for if he were told "It is the sign," he
might \[become complacent and\] stop short at that (see M I 193f.), and
if he were told "It is not the sign," he might get discouraged and give
up; so he should encourage him to keep giving it his attention without
saying either. So the Dīgha reciters say, firstly. But the Majjhima
reciters say that he should be told, "This is the sign, friend. Well
done. Keep giving attention to it again and again."



[219.] Then he should fix his mind on that same sign; and so
from now on, his



development proceeds by way of fixing. For the Ancients said this:



"Fixing his mind upon the sign\
And putting away61 extraneous aspects,



60\. "'Because of difference in perception': because of the difference
in the manner of perceiving that occurred before the arising of the
sign" (Vism-mhṭ 273).



61\. *Vibhāvayaṃ* can mean "to do away with" or "to explain." Either is
applicable here according to Vism-mhṭ 274.

The clever man anchors his mind\
Upon the breathings in and out."



[220.] So as soon as the sign appears, his hindrances are
suppressed, his defilements subside, his mindfulness is established, and
his consciousness is concentrated in access concentration.



[221.] Then he should not give attention to the sign as to its
colour, or review it as to its \[specific\] characteristic. He should
guard it as carefully as a king's chief queen guards the child in her
womb due to become a Wheel-turning Monarch,62 or as a farmer guards the
ripening crops; and he should avoid the seven unsuitable things
beginning with the unsuitable abode and cultivate the seven suitable
things. Then, guarding it thus, he should make it grow and improve with
repeated attention, and he should practice the tenfold skill in
absorption (IV.42) and bring about evenness of energy (IV.66).



[222.] As he strives thus, fourfold and fivefold jhāna is
achieved by him on that



same sign in the same way as described under the earth kasiṇa.



*5--8.* (See §189) However, when a bhikkhu has achieved the fourfold and
fivefold jhāna and wants to reach purity by developing the meditation
subject through *observing* and through *turning away*, he should make
that jhāna familiar by attaining mastery in it in the five ways
(IV.131), and then embark upon insight by defining
mentality-materiality. How?



[223.] On emerging from the attainment, \[287\] he sees that
the in-breaths and out-breaths have the physical body and the mind as
their origin; and that just as, when a blacksmith's bellows are being
blown, the wind moves owing to the bag and to the man's appropriate
effort, so too, in-breaths and out-breaths are due to the body and the
mind.



Next, he defines the in-breaths and out-breaths and the body as
"materiality," and the consciousness and the states associated with the
consciousness as "the immaterial \[mind\]." This is in brief (cf. M-a I
249); but the details will be explained later in the defining of
mentality-materiality (XVIII.3f.).



[224.]Having defined mentality-materiality in this way, he
seeks its condition. With search he finds it, and so overcomes his
doubts about the way of mentality- materiality's occurrence in the three
divisions of time (Ch. XIX).



His doubts being overcome, he attributes the three characteristics
\[beginning with that of suffering to mentality and materiality\],
comprehending \[them\] by groups (XX.2f.); he abandons the ten
imperfections of insight beginning with illumination, which arise in the
first stages of the contemplation of rise and fall (XX.105f.), and he
defines as "the path" the knowledge of the way that is free from these
imperfections (XX.126f.).



He reaches contemplation of dissolution by abandoning \[attention to\]
arising. When all formations have appeared as terror owing to the
contemplation of their incessant dissolution, he becomes dispassionate
towards them (Ch. XXI), his greed for them fades away, and he is
liberated from them (Ch. XXII).



62\. For the Wheel-turning Monarch (*cakkavattin*) see DN 26 and MN 129.



[]



[]



After he has \[thus\] reached the four noble paths in due succession and
has become established in the fruition of Arahantship, he at last
attains to the nineteen kinds of reviewing knowledge (XXII.19f.), and he
becomes fit to receive the highest gifts from the world with its
deities.



[225.] At this point his development of concentration through
mindfulness of breathing, beginning with *counting * and ending with
*looking back* (§189) is completed.



This is the commentary on the first tetrad in all aspects.



\[Word Commentary Continued---Second Tetrad\]



[226.] Now, since there is no separate method for developing
the meditation subject in the case of the other tetrads, their meaning
therefore needs only to be understood according to the word commentary.



[(v)] He trains thus: "*I shall breathe in ... shall breathe
out experiencing happiness*," that is, making happiness known, making it
plain. Herein, the happiness is experienced in two ways: (a) with the
object, and (b) with non-confusion.63



[227.] (a) How is the happiness experienced with the object? He
attains the two jhānas in which happiness is present. At the time when
he has actually entered upon them the happiness is experienced with the
object owing to the obtaining of the jhāna, because of the experiencing
of the object. (b) How with non- confusion? When, after entering upon
and emerging from one of the two jhānas accompanied by happiness,
\[288\] he comprehends with insight that happiness associated with the
jhāna as liable to destruction and to fall, then at the actual time of
the insight the happiness is experienced with non-confusion owing to the
penetration of its characteristics \[of impermanence, and so on\].



[228.] For this is said in the Paṭisambhidā: "When he knows
unification of mind and non-distraction through long in-breaths,
mindfulness is established in him. By means of that mindfulness and that
knowledge that happiness is experienced. When he knows unification of
mind and non-distraction through long out- breaths ... through short
in-breaths ... through short out-breaths ... through in- breaths ...
out-breaths experiencing the whole body ... through in-breaths ...
out-breaths tranquilizing the bodily formation, mindfulness is
established in



63\. "'With the object': under the heading of the object. The happiness
included in the jhāna that has that object is experienced 'because of
the experiencing of the object.' What is meant? Just as, when a man who
is looking for a snake discovers (experiences) its abode, the snake is,
as it were, already discovered (experienced) and caught, owing to the
ease with which he will then be able to catch it with charms and spells,
so too, when the object, which is the abode of the happiness, is
experienced (discovered), then the happiness itself is experienced
(discovered) too, owing to the ease with which it will be apprehended in
its specific and general characteristics. 'By his penetration of its
characteristics': by penetration of the specific and general
characteristics of happiness. For when the specific and general
characteristics of anything are experienced then that thing is
experienced according to reality" (Vism-mhṭ 276).



[]



[]



him. By means of that mindfulness and that knowledge that happiness is
experienced.



"It is experienced by him when he adverts, when he knows, sees, reviews,
steadies his mind, resolves with faith, exerts energy, establishes
mindfulness, concentrates his mind, understands with understanding,
directly knows what is to be directly known, fully understands what is
to be fully understood, abandons what is to be abandoned, develops what
is to be developed, realizes what is to be realized. It is in this way
that that happiness is experienced" (Paṭis I 187).



[229.] (vi--viii) The remaining \[three\] clauses should be
understood in the same way as to meaning; but there is this difference
here. The *experiencing* of bliss must be understood to be through three
jhānas, and that of the *mental formation* through four. The mental
formation consists of the two aggregates of feeling and perception. And
in the case of the clause, *experiencing bliss*, it is said in the
Paṭisambhidā in order to show the plane of insight here \[as well\]:
"'Bliss': there are two kinds of bliss, bodily bliss and mental bliss"
(Paṭis I 188). *Tranquilizing the mental formation*: tranquilizing the
gross mental formation; stopping it, is the meaning. And this should be
understood in detail in the same way as given under the bodily formation
(see §§176--85).



[230.] Here, moreover, in the "happiness" clause feeling
\[which is actually being contemplated in this tetrad\] is stated under
the heading of "happiness" \[which is a formation\] but in the "bliss"
clause feeling is stated in its own form. In the two "mental-formation"
clauses the feeling is that \[necessarily\] associated with perception
because of the words, "Perception and feeling belong to the mind, these
things being bound up with the mind are mental formations" (Paṭis I
188). \[289\]



So this tetrad should be understood to deal with contemplation of
feeling.



\[Word Commentary Continued---Third Tetrad\]



[231.] (ix) In the third tetrad the *experiencing* of the
\[*manner of*\] *consciousness* must be understood to be through four
jhānas.



[(x)]  *Gladdening the* \[*manner of*\]  *consciousness*: he
trains thus: "Making the mind glad, instilling gladness into it,
cheering it, rejoicing it, I shall breathe in, shall breathe out."
Herein, there is gladdening in two ways, through concentration and
through insight.



How through concentration? He attains the two jhānas in which happiness
is present. At the time when he has actually entered upon them he
inspires the mind with gladness, instils gladness into it, by means of
the happiness associated with the jhāna. How through insight? After
entering upon and emerging from one of the two jhānas accompanied by
happiness, he comprehends with insight that happiness associated with
the jhāna as liable to destruction and to fall; thus at the actual time
of insight he inspires the mind with gladness, instils gladness into it,
by making the happiness associated with the jhāna the object. It is of
one



[]



[]



progressing in this way that the words, "He trains thus: 'I shall
breathe in ... shall breathe out gladdening the \[manner of\]
consciousness,'" are said.



[232.](xi) *Concentrating* (*samādahaṃ*) *the* \[*manner of*\]
*consciousness*: evenly (*samaṃ*) placing (*ādahanto*) the mind, evenly
putting it on its object by means of the first jhāna and so on. Or
alternatively, when, having entered upon those jhānas and emerged from
them, he comprehends with insight the consciousness associated with the
jhāna as liable to destruction and to fall, then at the actual time of
insight momentary unification of the mind64 arises through the
penetration of the characteristics \[of impermanence, and so on\]. Thus
the words, "He trains thus: 'I shall breathe in ... shall breathe out
concentrating the \[manner of\] consciousness,'" are said also of one
who evenly places the mind, evenly puts it on its object by means of the
momentary unification of the mind arisen thus.



[233.] *Liberating the \[manner of\]*
*consciousness*: he both breathes in and breathes out delivering,
liberating, the mind from the hindrances by means of the first jhāna,
from applied and sustained thought by means of the second, from
happiness by means of the third, from pleasure and pain by means of the
fourth. Or alternatively, when, having entered upon those jhānas and
emerged from them, he comprehends with insight the consciousness
associated with the jhāna as liable to destruction and to fall, then at
the actual time of insight he delivers, liberates, the mind from the
perception of permanence by means of the contemplation of impermanence,
from the perception of pleasure by means of the contemplation of pain,
from the perception of self by means of the contemplation of not self,
from delight by means of the contemplation of dispassion, from greed by
means of the contemplation of fading away, from arousing by means of the
contemplation of cessation, from grasping by means of the contemplation
of relinquishment. Hence it is said: \[290\] "He trains thus: 'I shall
breathe in ... shall breathe out liberating the \[manner of\]
consciousness.65 '" So this tetrad should be understood to deal with
contemplation of mind.



64\. "'Momentary unification of the mind': concentration lasting only
for a moment. For that too, when it occurs uninterruptedly on its object
in a single mode and is not overcome by opposition, fixes the mind
immovably, as if in absorption" (Vism-mhṭ 278).\



65\. "'Delivering': secluding, separating, by means of deliverance
consisting in suppression; abandoning the hindrances, is the meaning.
'At the actual time of insight': at the time of contemplation of
dissolution. For dissolution is the furthest extreme of impermanence. So
the meditator who is contemplating dissolution by its means sees under
the heading of consciousness the whole field of formations as
impermanent, not as permanent; and because of the suffering inherent in
what is impermanent, and because of the absence of self in what is
painful, he sees that same whole field of formations as painful, not as
pleasant, and as not-self, not as self. But since what is impermanent,
painful, and not-self is not something to delight in, and what is not
something to delight in is not something to be greedy for, consequently
he becomes dispassionate towards that whole field of formations when it
is seen in the light of dissolution as impermanent, painful, not-self,
he does not delight in it, and his greed for it fades away, does not dye
him. Now, as he thus becomes dispassionate and his greed fades away, it
is firstly by means of CHAPTER VIII



Other Recollections as Meditation Subjects

\[Word Commentary Continued---Fourth Tetrad\]



[234.] But in the fourth tetrad, as to
*contemplating impermanence*, here firstly, the impermanent should be
understood, and impermanence, and the contemplation of impermanence, and
one contemplating impermanence.



Herein, the five aggregates are *the impermanent*. Why? Because their
essence



is rise and fall and change. *Impermanence* is the rise and fall and
change in those same aggregates, or it is their non-existence after
having been; the meaning is, it is the breakup of produced aggregates
through their momentary dissolution since they do not remain in the same
mode. *Contemplation of impermanence* is contemplation of materiality,
etc., as "impermanent" in virtue of that impermanence.  *One
contemplating impermanence* possesses that contemplation. So it is when
one such as this is breathing in and breathing out that it can be
understood of him: "He trains thus: 'I shall breathe in ... shall
breathe out contemplating impermanence.'"66



mundane knowledge only that he causes greed to cease and does not arouse
it. The meaning is that he does not bring about its arising. Or
alternatively, his greed having thus faded away, he causes by means of
his own knowledge the cessation of the unseen field of formations just
as that of the seen, he does not arouse it; the meaning is that he
brings about only its cessation, he does not bring about its arising.
Having entered on this way, he relinquishes, he does not grasp. What is
meant? It is that this contemplation of impermanence, etc., is called
relinquishment as giving up and relinquishment as entering into because
it gives up defilements along with aggregate- producing kamma-formations
and because, by seeing the flaws in what is formed and by inclining
towards the opposite of what is formed, namely Nibbāna, it enters into
that Nibbāna. Consequently the meditator who has that contemplation
gives up defilements and enters into Nibbāna in the way stated. Herein,
the contemplation of what is impermanent as only impermanent is
'contemplation of impermanence'; this is a name for insight that occurs
by taking formations of the three \[mundane\] planes \[and leaving aside
the supramundane\] as impermanent. 'From the perception of permanence':
from the wrong perception that occurs perceiving formed things as
permanent, eternal; also the various views should be regarded as
included under the heading of perception. Likewise with the perception
of pleasure and so on. 'By means of the contemplation of dispassion': by
means of the contemplation that occurs in the mode of dispassion for
formations. 'From delight': from craving accompanied by happiness. 'By
means of the contemplation of fading away': by means of the
contemplation that occurs similarly in the mode of fading away; hence
'delivering from greed' is said. 'By means of the contemplation of
cessation': by means of the successive seeing of formations' cessation.
Or contemplating cessation is contemplation such that formations cease
only and do not arise with future renewal. For this is knowledge of
desire for deliverance grown strong. Hence he said, 'delivering from
arousing.' Contemplation that occurs in the mode of relinquishing is
'contemplation of relinquishment.' 'From grasping': from taking as
permanent, etc.; or the meaning can also here be regarded as 'from
grasping rebirth-linking.' (Vism-mhṭ 279) See Chapters XX and XXI.\



66\. "What is called 'permanent' is what is lasting, eternal, like
Nibbāna. What is called 'impermanent' is what is not permanent, and is
possessed of rise and fall. He said 'The five aggregates are "the
impermanent,'" signifying that they are formed



[]



[]



[235.](xiv) *Contemplating fading away*: there are two kinds of
fading away, that is, fading away as destruction, and absolute fading
away.67 Herein, "fading away as destruction" is the momentary
dissolution of formations. "Absolute fading away" is Nibbāna.
Contemplation of fading away is insight and it is the path, which occurs
as the seeing of these two. It is when he possesses this twofold
contemplation that it can be understood of him: "He trains thus: 'I
shall breathe in ... shall breathe out contemplating fading away.'"



[(xv)] The same method of explanation applies to the clause,
*contemplating*



*cessation*.



[236.](xvi) *Contemplating relinquishment*: relinquishment is
of two kinds too, that is to say, relinquishment as giving up, and
relinquishment as entering into. Relinquishment itself as \[a way of\]
contemplation is "contemplation of relinquishment." For insight is
called both "relinquishment as giving up" and "relinquishment as
entering into" since \[firstly\], through substitution of opposite
qualities, it gives up defilements with their aggregate-producing kamma
formations, and \[secondly\], through seeing the wretchedness of what is
formed, it also enters into Nibbāna by inclining towards Nibbāna, which
is the opposite of the formed (XI.18). Also the path is called both
"relinquishment as giving up" and "relinquishment as entering into"
since it gives up defilements with their aggregate-producing
kamma-formations by cutting them off, and it enters into Nibbāna by
making it its object. Also both \[insight and path knowledge\] are
called contemplation (*anupassanā*) because of their re-seeing
successively (*anu anu passanā*) each preceding kind of knowledge.68
\[291\] It is when he possesses



dhammas as to meaning. Why? 'Because their essence is rise and fall and
change': the meaning is that their individual essences have rise and
fall and change. Herein, formed dhammas' arising owing to cause and
condition, their coming to be after non-existence, their acquisition of
an individual self (*attalābha*), is 'rise.' Their momentary cessation
when arisen is 'fall.'\



67\. "'Destruction' is the vanishing of formations; it is the act of
those formations' fading away, their disintegration, that is 'fading
away.' Destruction itself as fading away is 'fading away as
destruction'; this is momentary cessation. Formations fade away
absolutely here when this has been reached, thus it is 'absolute fading
away;' this is Nibbāna" (Vism-mhṭ 280).\



68\. "The act of relinquishing as the act of giving up by means of
substituting for what should be abandoned its opposite quality or by
cutting it off, is 'relinquishment as giving up.' Likewise the act of
relinquishing of self that takes place in non-formation of kamma, which
is the relinquishing of all substrata (circumstances) of becoming, being
the entering into that \[Nibbāna\] either by inclination towards it \[in
insight\] or by having it as object \[in the path\] is 'relinquishment
as entering into.' 'Through substitution of opposite qualities': here
contemplation of impermanence, firstly, gives up perception of
permanence by abandoning through substitution of the opposite \[e.g.
substituting perception of impermanence for that of permanence in the
case of all formed things\]. And the giving up in this way is in the
form of inducing non-occurrence. For all kamma-formations that are
rooted in defilements due to apprehending (formations) as permanent, and
the kamma-resultant aggregates rooted in both which might arise in the
future, are abandoned by causing their non-occurrence. Likewise in



[]



[]



this twofold contemplation that it can be understood of him: "He trains
thus: 'I shall breathe in ... shall breathe out contemplating
relinquishment.'"



[237.] This tetrad deals only with pure insight while the
previous three deal with serenity and insight. This is how the
development of mindfulness of breathing with its sixteen bases in four
tetrads should be understood.



\[Conclusion\]



This mindfulness of breathing with its sixteen bases thus is of great
fruit, of great benefit.



[238.] Its great beneficialness should be understood here as
peacefulness both because of the words, "And, bhikkhus, this
concentration through mindfulness of breathing, when developed and much
practiced, is both peaceful and sublime" (S V 321), etc., and because of
its ability to cut off applied thoughts; for it is because it is
peaceful, sublime, and an unadulterated blissful abiding that it cuts
off the mind's running hither and thither with applied thoughts
obstructive to concentration, and keeps the mind only on the breaths as
object. Hence it is said: "Mindfulness of breathing should be developed
in order to cut off applied thoughts" (A IV 353).



[239.] Also its great beneficialness should be understood as
the root condition for the perfecting of clear vision and deliverance;
for this has been said by the Blessed One: "Bhikkhus, mindfulness of
breathing, when developed and much practiced, perfects the four
foundations of mindfulness. The four foundations of mindfulness, when
developed and much practiced, perfect the seven enlightenment factors.
The seven enlightenment factors, when developed and much practiced,
perfect clear vision and deliverance" (M III 82).



[240.] Again its great beneficialness should be understood to
reside in the fact that it causes the final in-breaths and out-breaths
to be known; for this is said by the Blessed One: "Rāhula, when
mindfulness of breathing is thus developed, thus practiced much, the
final in-breaths and out-breaths, too, are known as they cease, not
unknown" (M I 425f.).



[241.] Herein, there are three kinds of \[breaths that are\]
final because of cessation, that is to say, final in becoming, final in
jhāna, and final in death. For, among the various kinds of becoming
(existence), in-breaths and out-breaths occur in the sensual-sphere
becoming, not in the fine-material and immaterial kinds of becoming.
That is why there are final ones in becoming. In the jhānas they occur



the case of perception of pain, and so on. 'Through seeing the
wretchedness of what is formed': through seeing the fault of
impermanence, etc., in the formed three-plane field of formations. It is
'the opposite of the formed' owing to its permanence, and so on. When
defilements are given up by the path, then kamma-formations are called
'given up' through producing (*āpādana*) in them the nature of not
causing result, and aggregates rooted in them are called 'given up'
through their being rendered fit for non-arising. So the path gives up
all these, is what is meant" (Vism-mhṭ 281). The word *pakkhandana*
(rendered by "entering into") is used to define the act of faith, and
can also be rendered by "launching out into" or by "leap."



[]



[]



in the first three but not in the fourth. That is why there are final
ones in jhāna. Those that arise along with the sixteenth consciousness
preceding the death consciousness \[292\] cease together with the death
consciousness. They are called "final in death." It is these last that
are meant here by "final."



[242.] When a bhikkhu has devoted himself to this meditation
subject, it seems, if he adverts, at the moment of arising of the
sixteenth consciousness before the death consciousness, to their
arising, then their arising is evident to him; if he adverts to their
presence, then their presence is evident to him; if he adverts to their
dissolution, then their dissolution is evident to him; and it is so
because he has thoroughly discerned in-breaths and out-breaths as
object.



[243.] When a bhikkhu has attained Arahantship by developing
some other meditation subject than this one, he may be able to define
his life term or not. But when he has reached Arahantship by developing
this mindfulness of breathing with its sixteen bases, he can always
define his life term. He knows, "My vital formations will continue now
for so long and no more." Automatically he performs all the functions of
attending to the body, dressing and robing, etc., after which he closes
his eyes, like the Elder Tissa who lived at the Koṭapabbata Monastery,
like the Elder Mahā Tissa who lived at the Mahā Karañjiya Monastery,
like the Elder Tissa the alms-food eater in the kingdom of Devaputta,
like the elders who were brothers and lived at the Cittalapabbata
monastery.



[244.] Here is one story as an illustration. After reciting the
Pātimokkha, it seems, on the Uposatha day of the full moon, one of the
two elders who were brothers went to his own dwelling place surrounded
by the Community of Bhikkhus. As he stood on the walk looking at the
moonlight he calculated his own vital formations, and he said to the
Community of Bhikkhus, "In what way have you seen bhikkhus attaining
Nibbāna up till now?" Some answered, "Till now we have seen them attain
Nibbāna sitting in their seats." Others answered, "We have seen them
sitting cross-legged in the air." The elder said, "I shall now show you
one attaining Nibbāna while walking." He then drew a line on the walk,
saying, "I shall go from this end of the walk to the other end and
return; when I reach this line I shall attain Nibbāna." So saying, he
stepped on to the walk and went to the far end. On his return he
attained Nibbāna in the same moment in which he stepped on the line.
\[293\]



So let a man, if he is wise,\
Untiringly devote his days\
To mindfulness of breathing, which\
Rewards him always in these ways.



This is the section dealing with mindfulness of breathing in the
detailed



explanation.



\[(10) RECOLLECTION  OF  PEACE\]



[245.] One who wants to develop the recollection of peace
mentioned next to mindfulness of breathing (III.105) should go into
solitary retreat and recollect the special qualities of Nibbāna, in
other words, the stilling of all suffering, as follows:



[]



[]



"Bhikkhus, in so far as there are dhammas, whether formed or unformed,
fading away is pronounced the best of them, that is to say, the
disillusionment of vanity, the elimination of thirst, the abolition of
reliance, the termination of the round, the destruction of craving,
fading away, cessation, Nibbāna" (A II 34).



[246.] Herein in *so far as* means as many as. *Dhammas *
\[means\] individual



essences.69  *Whether formed or unformed*: whether made by conditions
going



69\. "In such passages as 'Dhammas that are concepts' (Dhs p. 1, §1308)
even a non- entity (*abhāva*) is thus called a 'dhamma' since it is
borne (*dhārīyati*) and affirmed (*avadhārīyati*) by knowledge. That
kind of dhamma is excluded by his saying, *'Dhammas \[means\] individual
essences.'* The act of becoming (*bhavana*), which constitutes existing-
ness (*vijjamānatā*) in the ultimate sense, is essence (*bhāva*); it is
with essence (*saha bhāvena*), thus it is an individual essence
(*sabhāva*); the meaning is that it is possible (*labbhamānarūpa*) in
the true sense, in the ultimate sense. For these are called 'dhammas
(bearers)' because they bear (*dhāraṇa*) their own individual essences
(*sabhāva*), and they are called 'individual essences' in the sense
already explained" (Vism-mhṭ 282; cf. Ch. VII, n. 1).\
In the Piṭakas the word *sabhāva* seems to appear only once (Paṭis II
178). It next appears in the Netti (p.79), the *Milindapañhā* (pp. 90,
164, 212, 360). It is extensively used for exegetical purposes in the
*Visuddhimagga* and main commentaries and likewise in the
subcommentaries. As has just been shown, it is narrower than dhamma (see
also Ch. XXIII. n. 18). It often roughly corresponds to *dhātu*
(element---see e.g. Dhs-a 263) and to *lakkhaṇa* (characteristic---see
below), but less nearly to the vaguer and (in Pali) untechnical *pakati*
(nature), or to *rasa* (function---see I.21). The *Atthasālinī*
observes: "It is the individual essence, or the generality, of such and
such dhammas that is called their characteristic" (Dhs-a 63); on which
the *Mūla Þīkā* comments: "The *individual essence* consisting in, say,
hardness as that of earth, or touching as that of contact, is not common
to all dhammas. The *generality* is the individual essence common to all
consisting in impermanence, etc.; also in this context (i.e. Dhs §1) the
characteristic of being profitable may be regarded as general because it
is the individual *essence* common to all that is profitable; or
alternatively it is their individual *essence* because it is not common
to the unprofitable and indeterminate \[kinds of consciousness\]" (Dhs-
a 63). The individual *essence* of any formed dhamma is manifested in
the three instants of its existence (*atthitā, vijjamānatā*), namely,
arising, presence (= aging) and dissolution.\
It comes from nowhere and goes nowhere (XV.15) and is borne by the mind.
Dhammas without individual essence (*asabhāvadhamma*) include the
attainment of cessation (see Ch. XXIII, n. 18) and some concepts. Space
and time belong to the last-mentioned. Of space (*ākāsa*) the *Majjhima
Nikāya* *Þīkā* says: "Space, which is quite devoid of individual
essence, is called empty" (commenting on MN 106), while of time (*kāla*)
the *Mūla Þīkā* says: "Though time is determined by the kind of
consciousness \[e.g. as specified in the first paragraph of the
Dhammasaṅgaṇī\] and is non-existent (*avijjamāna*) as to individual
essence, yet as the non-entity (*abhāva*) before and after the moment in
which those \[conascent and co-present\] dhammas occur, it is called the
'container (*adhikaraṇa*)'; it is perceived (symbolized) only as the
state of a receptacle (*ādhāra-bhāva*) (Dhs-a 62). Of Nibbāna (for which
see XVI.46ff.), which has its own individual essence, the *Mūla Þīkā*
says "Nibbāna is not like other dhammas; because of its extreme
profundity it cannot be made an object of consciousness (*ālambituṃ*) by
one who has not realized it. That is why it has to be realized by
change-of-lineage. It has profundity surpassing any individual essence
belonging to the three periods of time" (Vibh-a 38).

together, coming together, or not so made.70 *Fading away is pronounced
the best of them*: of these formed and unformed dhammas, fading away is
pronounced the best, is called the foremost, the highest.



[247.] Herein  *fading away* is not mere absence of greed, but
rather it is that unformed dhamma which, while given the names
"disillusionment of vanity," etc., in the clause, "that is to say, the
disillusionment of vanity, ... Nibbāna," is treated basically as *fading
away*.71 It is called *disillusionment of vanity* because on coming to
it all kinds of vanity (intoxication), such as the vanity of conceit,
and vanity of manhood, are disillusioned, undone, done away with.72 And
it is called *elimination of thirst* because on coming to it all thirst
for sense desires is eliminated and quenched. But it is called
*abolition of reliance* because on coming to its reliance on the five
cords of sense desire is abolished. It is called *termination of the
round * because on coming to it the round of the three planes \[of
existence\] is terminated. It is called *destruction of craving* because
on coming to it craving is



*Sabhāva* has not the extreme vagueness of its parent *bhāva,* which can
mean anything between "essence" (see e.g. Dhs-a 61) and "-ness" (e.g.
*natthibhāva* = non-existingness---\
X.35). This may be remembered when *sabhāva* is defined as above thus:
"It is with essence (*sahabhāvena*), thus it is individual essence
(*sabhāva*)" (Vism-mhṭ 282), and when it is defined again thus: "A
dhamma's own essence or its existing essence (*sako vā bhāvo samāno vā
bhāvo*) is its individual essence (*sabhāva*)" (Vism-mhṭ 433). *Sabhāva*
can also be the basis of a wrong view, if regarded as the sole efficient
cause or condition of any formed thing (Ch. XVI, n.23). The Sanskrit
equivalent, *svabhāva*, had a great vogue and checkered history in
philosophical discussions on the Indian mainland.\
This (unlike the word, *dhamma,* which has many "referents") is an
instance in which it is of first importance to stick to one rendering.
The word is a purely exegetical one; consequently vagueness is
undesirable. "Individual essence" has been chosen principally on
etymological grounds, and the word "essence" (an admittedly slippery
customer) must be understood from the contexts in which it is used and
not prejudged. Strictly it refers here to the triple moment of arising
etc., of formed dhammas that can have such "existence" in their own
right and be experienced as such; and it refers to the realizability of
Nibbāna. We are here in the somewhat magical territory of ontology, a
subject that is at present undergoing one of its periodical upheavals in
Europe, this time in the hands of the existentialists. Consequently it
is important to approach the subject with an open mind.\



70\. "'Made' is generated. 'Not so made' is not made by any conditions
at all." (Vism-mhṭ 281)\



71\. "That dhamma possessing individual essence and having the
characteristic of being not formed is to be treated basically as 'fading
away,' since it is there that the dhamma of defilement fades away"
(Vism-mhṭ 282).\



72\. "When they are being abandoned by the noble path, which occurs by
making Nibbāna its object, it is said that they are abandoned by
reaching that \[Nibbāna\] which is why he said, 'Because on coming to
it,' and so on. Herein, 'vanity of conceit (*māna- mada*)' is conceit
(*māna*) that occurs as conceiving (*maññanā*) 'I am superior' (Vibh
353). 'Vanity of manhood' is vanity about being of the male sex. The
words 'such as' refer to vanity of birth, and so on (Vibh 345)"
(Vism-mhṭ 282).



[]



[]



entirely destroyed, fades away and ceases. It is called *Nibbāna*
(extinction) because it has gone away from (*nikkhanta*), has escaped
from (*nissaṭa*), is dissociated from craving, which has acquired in
common usage the name "fastening" (*vāna*) because, by ensuring
successive becoming, craving serves as a joining together, a binding
together, a lacing together, of the four kinds of generation, five
destinies, seven stations of consciousness and nine abodes of beings.73
\[294\]



[248.] This is how peace, in other words, Nibbāna, should be
recollected according to its special qualities beginning with
disillusionment of vanity. But it should also be recollected according
to the other special qualities of peace stated by the Blessed One in the
suttas beginning with: "Bhikkhus, I shall teach you the unformed ... the
truth ... the other shore ... the hard-to-see ... the undecaying ... the
lasting ... the undiversified ... the deathless ... the auspicious ...
the safe ... the marvellous ... the intact ... the unafflicted ... the
purity ... the island ... the shelter ...." (S IV 360--72).74



[249.] As he recollects peace in its special qualities of
disillusionment of vanity, etc., in this way, then: "On that occasion
his mind is not obsessed by greed or obsessed by hate or obsessed by
delusion; his mind has rectitude on that occasion, being inspired by
peace" (see VII.65, etc.). So when he has suppressed the hindrances in
the way already described under the recollection of the Enlightened One,
etc., the jhāna factors arise in a single moment. But owing to the
profundity of the special qualities of peace, or owing to his being
occupied in recollecting special qualities of various kinds, the jhāna
is only access and does not reach absorption. And that jhāna itself is
known as "recollection of peace" too because it arises by means of the
special qualities of peace.



[250.] And as in the case of the six recollections, this also
comes to success only in a noble disciple. Still, though this is so, it
can nevertheless also be brought to mind by an ordinary person who
values peace. For even by hearsay the mind has confidence in peace.



[251.] A bhikkhu who is devoted to this recollection of peace
sleeps in bliss and wakes in bliss, his faculties are peaceful, his mind
is peaceful, he has conscience and shame, he is confident, he is
resolved \[to attain\] the superior \[state\], he is respected and
honoured by his fellows in the life of purity. And even if he penetrates
no higher, he is at least headed for a happy destiny.



73\. Modern etymology derives the word Nibbāna (Skr. *nirvāṇa*) from the
negative prefix  *nir* plus the root *vā* (to blow). The original
literal meaning was probably "extinction" of a fire by ceasing to blow
on it with bellows (a smith's fire for example). It seems to have been
extended to extinction of fire by any means, for example, the going out
of a lamp's flame (*nibbāyati---*M III 245). By analogy it was extended
to the extinction of the five-aggregate process on the Arahant's death
(see It 38). Nibbāna is not the "extinction of a self or of a living
lasting being," such a mistaken opinion being the annihilation view (see
e.g. M I 140, S III 109).\



74\. Some texts add *leṇa* (another word for shelter). Still others are
given in the Saṃyutta text.

## CHAPTER IX 


THE DIVINE ABIDINGS



(*Brahmavihāra-niddesa*)



\[(1) LOVING-KINDNESS\]



[1.]\[295\] The four divine abidings were mentioned next to the
recollections as meditation subjects (III.105). They are
loving-kindness, compassion, gladness and equanimity. A meditator, who
wants to develop firstly loving-kindness among these, if he is a
beginner, should sever the impediments and learn the meditation subject.
Then, when he has done the work connected with the meal and got rid of
any dizziness due to it, he should seat himself comfortably on a
well-prepared seat in a secluded place. To start with, he should review
the danger in hate and the advantage in patience.



[2.] Why? Because hate has to be abandoned and patience
attained in the development of this meditation subject, and he cannot
abandon unseen dangers and attain unknown advantages.



Now, the danger in hate should be seen in accordance with such suttas as
this: "Friends, when a man hates, is a prey to hate and his mind is
obsessed by hate, he kills living things, and ..." (A I 216). And the
advantage in patience should be understood according to such suttas as
these:



"No higher rule, the Buddhas say, than patience,\
And no Nibbāna higher than forbearance" (D II 49; Dhp 184);



"Patience in force, in strong array:\
'Tis him I call a brahman" (Dhp 399);



"No greater thing exists than patience" (S I 222).



[3.]Thereupon he should embark upon the development of
loving-kindness for the purpose of secluding the mind from hate seen as
a danger and introducing it to patience known as an advantage.



But when he begins, he must know that some persons are of the wrong sort
at the very beginning and that loving-kindness should be developed
towards certain kinds of persons and not towards certain other kinds at
first. \[296\]



[4.]For loving-kindness should not be developed at first
towards the following four kinds of persons: an antipathetic person, a
very dearly loved friend, a neutral person, and a hostile person. Also
it should not be developed specifically (see §49) towards the opposite
sex, or towards a dead person.


[]



[]



[5.] What is the reason why it should not be developed at first
towards an antipathetic person and the others? To put an antipathetic
person in a dear one's place is fatiguing. To put a very dearly loved
friend in a neutral person's place is fatiguing; and if the slightest
mischance befalls the friend, he feels like weeping. To put a neutral
person in a respected one's or a dear one's place is fatiguing. Anger
springs up in him if he recollects a hostile person. That is why it
should not be developed at first towards an antipathetic person and the
rest.



[6.]Then, if he develops it specifically towards the opposite
sex, lust inspired by that person springs up in him. An elder supported
by a family was asked, it seems, by a friend's son, "Venerable sir,
towards whom should loving-kindness be developed?" The elder told him,
"Towards a person one loves." He loved his own wife. Through developing
loving-kindness towards her he was fighting against the wall all the
night.1 That is why it should not be developed specifically towards the
opposite sex.



[7.]But if he develops it towards a dead person, he reaches
neither absorption nor access. A young bhikkhu, it seems, had started
developing loving-kindness inspired by his teacher. His loving-kindness
made no headway at all. He went to a senior elder and told him,
"Venerable sir, I am quite familiar with attaining jhāna through
loving-kindness, and yet I cannot attain it. What is the matter?" The
elder said, "Seek the sign, friend, \[the object of your meditation\]."
He did so. Finding that his teacher had died, he proceeded with
developing loving-kindness inspired by another and attained absorption.
That is why it should not be developed towards one who is dead.



[8.]First of all it should be developed only towards oneself,
doing it repeatedly thus: "May I be happy and free from suffering" or
"May I keep myself free from enmity, affliction and anxiety and live
happily."



[9.]If that is so, does it not conflict with what is said in
the texts? For there is no mention of any development of it towards
oneself in what is said in the Vibhaṅga: "And how does a bhikkhu dwell
pervading one direction with his heart filled with loving-kindness? Just
as he would feel loving-kindness on seeing a dearly loved person, so he
pervades all beings with loving-kindness" (Vibh 272); and in what is
said in the Paṭisambhidā: "In what five ways is the mind-deliverance of
loving-kindness \[practiced\] with unspecified pervasion? May all beings
be free from enmity, affliction and anxiety and live happily. May all
breathing things \[297\] ... all who are born ... all persons ... all
those who have a personality be free from enmity, affliction and anxiety
and live happily" (Paṭis II 130); and in what is said in the Mettā
Sutta: "In joy and safety may all beings be joyful at heart" (Sn 145).
\[Does it not conflict with those texts?\]



1\. "'Fighting against the wall': having undertaken the precepts of
virtue and sat down on a seat in his room with the door locked, he was
developing loving-kindness. Blinded by lust arisen under cover of the
loving-kindness, he wanted to go to his wife, and without noticing the
door he beat on the wall in his desire to get out even by breaking the
wall down" (Vism-mhṭ 286).



[]



[]



[10.] It does not conflict. Why not? Because that refers to
absorption. But this \[initial development towards oneself\] refers to
\[making oneself\] an example. For even if he developed loving-kindness
for a hundred or a thousand years in this way, "I am happy" and so on,
absorption would never arise. But if he develops it in this way: "I am
happy. Just as I want to be happy and dread pain, as I want to live and
not to die, so do other beings, too," making himself the example, then
desire for other beings' welfare and happiness arises in him. And this
method is indicated by the Blessed One's saying:



I visited all quarters with my mind\
Nor found I any dearer than myself;\
Self is likewise to every other dear;\
Who loves himself will never harm another (S I 75; Ud 47).



[11.]So he should first, as example, pervade himself with
loving-kindness. Next after that, in order to proceed easily, he can
recollect such gifts,2 kind words, etc., as inspire love and endearment,
such virtue, learning, etc., as inspire respect and reverence met with
in a teacher or his equivalent or a preceptor or his equivalent,
developing loving-kindness towards him in the way beginning, "May this
good man be happy and free from suffering." With such a person, of
course, he attains absorption.



[12.]But if this bhikkhu does not rest content with just that
much and wants to break down the barriers, he should next, after that,
develop loving-kindness towards a very dearly loved friend, then towards
a neutral person as a very dearly loved friend, then towards a hostile
person as neutral. And while he does so, he should make his mind
malleable and wieldy in each instance before passing on to the next.



[13.]But if he has no enemy, or he is of the type of a great
man who does not perceive another as an enemy even when the other does
him harm, he should not interest himself as follows: "Now that my
consciousness of loving-kindness has become wieldy towards a neutral
person, I shall apply it to a hostile one." \[298\] Rather it was about
one who actually has an enemy that it was said above that he should
develop loving-kindness towards a hostile person as neutral.



\[Getting Rid of Resentment\]



[14.]If resentment arises in him when he applies his mind to a
hostile person because he remembers wrongs done by that person, he
should get rid of the resentment by entering repeatedly into
loving-kindness \[jhāna\] towards any of the first-mentioned persons and
then, after he has emerged each time, directing loving-kindness towards
that person.



[15.]But if it does not die out in spite of his efforts, then:



Let him reflect upon the saw\
With other figures of such kind,



2\. Reading *dāna-piyavacanādīni* with Ce (see four
*saṅgahavatthūni---*A II 32).



[]



[]



And strive, and strive repeatedly,\
To leave resentment far behind.



He should admonish himself in this way: "Now, you who get angry, has not
the Blessed One said this: 'Bhikkhus, even if bandits brutally severed
limb from limb with a two-handled saw, he who entertained hate in his
heart on that account would not be one who carried out my teaching?'" (M
I 129). And this:



"To repay angry men in kind\
Is worse than to be angry first;\
Repay not angry men in kind\
And win a battle hard to win.



The weal of both he does promote,\
His own and then the other's too,\
Who shall another's anger know\
And mindfully maintain his peace" (S I 162).



And this: "Bhikkhus, there are seven things gratifying and helpful to an
enemy that happen to one who is angry, whether woman or man. What seven?
Here, bhikkhus, an enemy wishes thus for his enemy, 'Let him be ugly!'
Why is that? An enemy does not delight in an enemy's beauty. Now, this
angry person is a prey to anger, ruled by anger; though well bathed,
well anointed, with hair and beard trimmed and clothed in white, yet he
is ugly, being a prey to anger. This is the first thing gratifying and
helpful to an enemy that befalls one who is angry, whether woman or man.
Furthermore, an enemy wishes thus for his enemy, 'Let him lie in pain!'
... 'Let him have no fortune!' ... 'Let him not be wealthy!' ... 'Let
him not be famous!' ... 'Let him have no friends!' \[299\] ... 'Let him
not on the breakup of the body, after death, reappear in a happy destiny
in the heavenly world!'3 Why is that? An enemy does not delight in an
enemy's going to a happy destiny. Now, this angry person is a prey to
anger, ruled by anger; he misconducts himself in body, speech and mind.
Misconducting himself thus in body, speech and mind, on the breakup of
the body, after death, he reappears in a state of loss, in an unhappy
destiny, in perdition, in hell, being a prey to anger" (A IV 94).? And
this: "As a log from a pyre, burnt at both ends and fouled in the
middle, serves neither for timber in the village nor for timber in the
forest, so is such a person as this I say" (A II 95, It 90)?. "If you
are angry now, you will be one who does not carry out the Blessed One's
teaching; by repaying an angry man in kind you will be worse than the
angry man and not win the battle hard to win; you will yourself do to
yourself the things that help your enemy; and you will be like a pyre
log." (*Source untraced*)



[16.]If his resentment subsides when he strives and makes
effort in this way, it is good. If not, then he should remove irritation
by remembering some controlled and purified state in that person, which
inspires confidence when remembered.



[17.]For one person may be controlled in his bodily behaviour
with his control in doing an extensive course of duty known to all,
though his verbal and mental



3\. The Aṅguttara text has "Let him ... reappear in a state of loss" and
so on.



[]



[]



behaviour are not controlled. Then the latter should be ignored and the
control in his bodily behaviour remembered.



[18.]Another may be controlled in his verbal behaviour, and his
control known to all---he may naturally be clever at welcoming kindly,
easy to talk with, congenial, open-countenanced, deferential in speech,
and he may expound the Dhamma with a sweet voice and give explanations
of Dhamma with well- rounded phrases and details---though his bodily and
mental behaviour are not controlled. Then the latter should be ignored
and the control in his verbal behaviour remembered.



[19.] Another may be controlled in his mental behaviour, and
his control in worshiping at shrines, etc., evident to all. For when one
who is uncontrolled in mind pays homage at a shrine or at an
Enlightenment Tree or to elders, he does not do it carefully, \[300\]
and he sits in the Dhamma-preaching pavilion with mind astray or
nodding, while one whose mind is controlled pays homage carefully and
deliberately, listens to the Dhamma attentively, remembering it, and
evincing the confidence in his mind through his body or his speech. So
another may be only controlled in his mental behaviour, though his
bodily and verbal behaviour are not controlled. Then the latter should
be ignored and the control in his mental behaviour remembered.



[20.]But there may be another in whom not even one of these
three things is controlled. Then compassion for that person should be
aroused thus: "Though he is going about in the human world now,
nevertheless after a certain number of days he will find himself in
\[one of\] the eight great hells or the sixteen prominent hells.4" For
irritation subsides too through compassion. In yet another all three may
be controlled. Then he can remember any of the three in that person,
whichever he likes; for the development of loving-kindness towards such
a person is easy.



[21.]And in order to make the meaning of this clear the
following sutta from the Book of Fives should be cited in full:
"Bhikkhus, there are five ways of dispelling annoyance whereby annoyance
arisen in a bhikkhu can be entirely dispelled" (A III 186--90).



[22.] But if irritation still arises in him in spite of his
efforts, then he should admonish himself thus:



Suppose an enemy has hurt\
You now in what is his domain,\
Why try yourself as well to hurt\
Your mind?---That is not his domain.



In tears you left your family.\
They had been kind and helpful too.



4\. "The eight great hells beginning with that of Sañjīva (see J-a V
266, 270). At each of the four doors of the Great Unmitigated (*Avīci*)
Hell there are the four beginning with the Ember (*Kukuḷa*) Hell (M III
185), which make up the sixteen prominent hells" (Vism-mhṭ 291).



[]



[]



So why not leave your enemy,\
The anger that brings harm to you?



This anger that you entertain\
Is gnawing at the very roots\
Of all the virtues that you guard---\
Who is there such a fool as you?



Another does ignoble deeds,\
So you are angry---How is this?\
Do you then want to copy too\
The sort of acts that he commits?



Suppose another, to annoy,\
Provokes you with some odious act,\
Why suffer anger to spring up,\
And do as he would have you do?



If you get angry, then maybe\
You make *him* suffer, maybe not;\
Though with the hurt that anger brings\
*You * certainly are punished now.



If anger-blinded enemies\
Set out to tread the path of woe,\
Do you by getting angry too\
Intend to follow heel to toe?



If hurt is done you by a foe\
Because of anger on your part,\
Then put your anger down, for why\
Should you be harassed groundlessly? \[301\]



Since states last but a moment's time\
Those aggregates, by which was done\
The odious act, have ceased, so now\
What is it you are angry with?



Whom shall he hurt, who seeks to hurt\
Another, in the other's absence?\
*Your* presence is the cause of hurt;\
Why are you angry, then, with *him*?



[23.]But if resentment does not subside when he admonishes
himself thus, then he should review the fact that he himself and the
other are owners of their deeds (*kamma*).



Herein, he should first review this in himself thus: "Now, what is the
point of your getting angry with him? Will not this kamma of yours that
has anger as its source lead to your own harm? For you are the owner of
your deeds, heir of your deeds, having deeds as your parent, deeds as
your kin, deeds as your refuge; you will become the heir of whatever
deeds you do (see A III 186). And this is not the kind of deed to bring
you to full enlightenment, to undeclared enlightenment or



[]



[]



to the disciple's grade, or to any such position as the status of Brahmā
or Sakka, or the throne of a Wheel-turning Monarch or a regional king,
etc.; but rather this is the kind of deed to lead to your fall from the
Dispensation, even to the status of the eaters of scraps, etc., and to
the manifold suffering in the hells, and so on. By doing this you are
like a man who wants to hit another and picks up a burning ember or
excrement in his hand and so first burns himself or makes himself
stink."



[24.] Having reviewed ownership of deeds in himself in this
way, he should review it in the other also: "And what is the point of
his getting angry with you? Will it not lead to his own harm? For that
venerable one is owner of his deeds, heir of his deeds ... he will
become the heir of whatever deeds he does. And this is not the kind of
deed to bring him to full enlightenment, to undeclared enlightenment or
to the disciple's grade, or to any such position as the status of Brahmā
or Sakka, or to the throne of a Wheel-turning Monarch or a regional
king, etc.; but rather this is the kind of deed to lead to his fall from
the Dispensation, even to the status of the eaters of scraps, etc., and
to the manifold suffering in the hells, and so on. By doing this he is
like a man who wants to throw dust at another against the wind and only
covers himself with it." For this is said by the Blessed One:



"When a fool hates a man that has no hate,\
Is purified and free from every blemish, \[302\]\
Such evil he will find comes back on him,\
As does fine dust thrown up against the wind" (Dhp 125).



[25.]But if it still does not subside in him when he reviews
ownership of deeds in this way, then he should review the special
qualities of the Master's former conduct.



[26.]Here is the way of reviewing it: "Now you who have gone
forth, is it not a fact that when your Master was a Bodhisatta before
discovering full enlightenment, while he was still engaged in fulfilling
the perfections during the four incalculable ages and a hundred thousand
aeons, he did not allow hate to corrupt his mind even when his enemies
tried to murder him on various occasions?



[27.]"For example, in the Sīlavant Birth Story (J-a I 261) when
his friends rose to prevent his kingdom of three hundred leagues being
seized by an enemy king who had been incited by a wicked minister in
whose mind his own queen had sown hate for him, he did not allow them to
lift a weapon. Again when he was buried, along with a thousand
companions, up to the neck in a hole dug in the earth in a charnel
ground, he had no thought of hate. And when, after saving his life by a
heroic effort helped by jackals scraping away soil when they had come to
devour the corpses, he went with the aid of a spirit to his own bedroom
and saw his enemy lying on his own bed, he was not angry but treated him
as a friend, undertaking a mutual pledge, and he then exclaimed:



"The brave aspire, the wise will not lose heart;\
I see myself as I had wished to be" (J-a I 267).



[]



[]



[28.] "And in the Khantivādin Birth Story he was asked by the
stupid king of Kāsi (Benares), 'What do you preach, monk?' and he
replied, 'I am a preacher of patience'; and when the king had him
flogged with scourges of thorns and had his hands and feet cut off, he
felt not the slightest anger (see J-a III 39).



[29.]"It is perhaps not so wonderful that an adult who had
actually gone forth into homelessness should have acted in that way; but
also as an infant he did so. For in the Cūḷa-Dhammapāla Birth Story his
hands and feet were ordered to be lopped off like four bamboo shoots by
his father, King Mahāpatāpa, and his mother lamented over him thus:



"Oh, Dhammapāla's arms are severed\
That had been bathed in sandalwood;\
He was the heir to all the earth:\
O king, my breath is choking me!" (J-a III 181). \[303\]



"Then his father, still not satisfied, commanded that his head be cut
off as well. But even then he had not the least trace of hate, since he
had firmly resolved thus: 'Now is the time to restrain your mind; now,
good Dhammapāla, be impartial towards these four persons, that is to
say, towards your father who is having your head cut off, the man who is
beheading you, your lamenting mother, and yourself.'



[30.]"And it is perhaps not so wonderful that one who had
become a human being should have acted in that way; but also as an
animal he did so. For while the Bodhisatta was the elephant called
Chaddanta he was pierced in the navel by a poisoned shaft. But even then
he allowed no hate towards the hunter who had wounded him to corrupt his
mind, according as it is said:



The elephant, when struck by the stout shaft,\
Addressed the hunter with no hate in mind:\
What is your aim? What is the reason why\
You kill me thus? What can your purpose be? (J-a V 51).



"And when the elephant had spoken thus and was told, 'Sir, I have been
sent by the king of Kāsi's queen to get your tusks,' in order to fulfil
her wish he cut off his own tusks whose gorgeous radiance glittered with
the flashes of the six- coloured rays and gave them to him.



[31.]"And when he was the Great Monkey, the man whom he had
pulled out of a rocky chasm thought:



'Now, this is food for human kind\
Like other forest animals,\
So why then should a hungry man\
Not kill the ape to eat? \[I ask.\]



I'll travel independently\
Taking his meat as a provision;\
Thus I shall cross the waste, and that\
Will furnish my viaticum' (J-a V 71).



Then he took up a stone and dashed it on his head. But the monkey looked
at



him with eyes full of tears and said:



[]



[]



'Oh, act not so, good sir, or else\
The fate you reap will long deter\
All others from such deeds as this\
That you would do to me today' (J-a V 71).



And with no hate in his mind and regardless of his own pain he saw to it
that



the man reached his journey's end in safety.



[32.]"And while he was the royal nāga (serpent) Bhūridatta,
\[304\] when he had undertaken the Uposatha precepts and was lying on
the top of a termite-mound, though he was \[caught and\] sprinkled with
medicinal charms resembling the fire that ushers in the end of an aeon,
and was put into a box and treated as a plaything throughout the whole
of Jambudīpa, yet he had no trace of hate for that brahman, according as
it is said:



'While being put into the coffer\
And being crushed down with his hand,\
I had no hate for Ālambāna\
Lest I should break my precept vow' (Cp 85).



[33.]"And when he was the royal nāga Campeyya he let no hate
spring up in his mind while he was being cruelly treated by a snake
charmer, according as it is said:



"While I was living in the Law\
Observing the Uposatha\
A snake charmer took me away\
To play with at the royal gate.



Whatever hue he might conceive,\
Blue and yellow, and red as well,\
So in accordance with his thought\
I would become what he had wished;



I would turn dry land into water,\
And water into land likewise.\
Now, had I given way to wrath\
I could have seared him into ash,



Had I relaxed mind-mastery\
I should have let my virtue lapse;\
And one who lets his virtue lapse\
Cannot attain the highest goal" (Cp 85).



[34.]"And when he was the royal nāga Saṅkhapāla, while he was
being carried along on a carrying pole by the sixteen village boys after
they had wounded him in eight places with sharp spears and inserted
thorn creepers into the wounds' orifices, and while, after threading a
strong rope through his nose, they were causing him great agony by
dragging him along bumping his body on the surface of the ground, though
he was capable of turning those village boys to cinders with a mere
glance, yet he did not even show the least trace of hate on opening his
eyes, according as it is said:



[]



[]



'On the fourteenth and the fifteenth too, Āḷāra,\
I regularly kept the Holy Day,\
Until there came those sixteen village boys\
Bearing a rope and a stout spear as well.



The hunters cleft my nose, and through the slit\
They passed a rope and dragged me off like that.\
But though I felt such poignant agony,\
I let no hate disturb my Holy Day" (J-a V 172). \[305\]



[35.]"And he performed not only these wonders but also many
others too such as those told in the Mātuposaka Birth Story (J-a IV 90).
Now, it is in the highest degree improper and unbecoming to you to
arouse thoughts of resentment, since you are emulating as your Master
that Blessed One who reached omniscience and who has in the special
quality of patience no equal in the world with its deities."



[36.]But if, as he reviews the special qualities of the
Master's former conduct, the resentment still does not subside in him,
since he has long been used to the slavery of defilement, then he should
review the suttas that deal with the beginninglessness \[of the round of
rebirths\]. Here is what is said: "Bhikkhus, it is not easy to find a
being who has not formerly been your mother ... your father ... your
brother ... your sister ... your son ... your daughter" (S II 189--90).
Consequently he should think about that person thus: "This person, it
seems, as my mother in the past carried me in her womb for ten months
and removed from me without disgust, as if it were yellow sandalwood, my
urine, excrement, spittle, snot, etc., and played with me in her lap,
and nourished me, carrying me about on her hip. And this person as my
father went by goat paths and paths set on piles,5 etc., to pursue the
trade of merchant, and he risked his life for me by going into battle in
double array, by sailing on the great ocean in ships and doing other
difficult things, and he nourished me by bringing back wealth by one
means or another thinking to feed his children. And as my brother,
sister, son, daughter, this person gave me such and such help. So it is
unbecoming for me to harbour hate for him in my mind."



[37.]But if he is still unable to quench that thought in this
way, then he should review the advantages of loving-kindness thus: "Now,
you who have gone forth into homelessness, has it not been said by the
Blessed One as follows: 'Bhikkhus, when the mind-deliverance of
loving-kindness is cultivated, developed, much practiced, made the
vehicle, made the foundation, established, consolidated, and properly
undertaken, eleven blessings can be expected. What are the eleven? A man
sleeps in comfort, wakes in comfort, and dreams no evil dreams, he is
dear to human beings, he is dear to non-human beings, deities guard him,
fire and poison and weapons do not affect him, his mind is easily
concentrated, the expression of his face is serene, he dies unconfused,
if he penetrates no higher



5\. *Saṅku-patha---*"set on piles": Vism-mhṭ (p. 294) says: "*Saṅku
laggāpetvā te ālambhitvā* *gamanamaggo saṅkupatho.*" This disagrees with
PED for this ref.



[]



[]



he will be reborn in the Brahmā-world' (A V 342). \[306\] If you do not
stop this thought, you will be denied these advantages."



[38.]But if he is still unable to stop it in this way, he
should try resolution into elements. How? "Now, you who have gone forth
into homelessness, when you are angry with him, what is it you are angry
with? Is it head hairs you are angry with? Or body hairs? Or nails? ...
Or is it urine you are angry with? Or alternatively, is it the earth
element in the head hairs, etc., you are angry with? Or the water
element? Or the fire element? Or is it the air element you are angry
with? Or among the five aggregates or the twelve bases or the eighteen
elements with respect to which this venerable one is called by such and
such a name, which then, is it the materiality aggregate you are angry
with? Or the feeling aggregate, the perception aggregate, the formations
aggregate, the consciousness aggregate you are angry with? Or is it the
eye base you are angry with? Or the visible-object base you are angry
with? ... Or the mind base you are angry with? Or the mental-object base
you are angry with? Or is it the eye element you are angry with? Or the
visible-object element? Or the eye-consciousness element? ... Or the
mind element? Or the mental-object element? Or the mind-consciousness
element you are angry with?" For when he tries the resolution into
elements, his anger finds no foothold, like a mustard seed on the point
of an awl or a painting on the air.



[39.]But if he cannot effect the resolution into elements, he
should try the giving of a gift. It can either be given by himself to
the other or accepted by himself from the other. But if the other's
livelihood is not purified and his requisites are not proper to be used,
it should be given by oneself. And in the one who does this the
annoyance with that person entirely subsides. And in the other even
anger that has been dogging him from a past birth subsides at the
moment, as happened to the senior elder who received a bowl given to him
at the Cittalapabbata Monastery by an almsfood-eater elder who had been
three times made to move from his lodging by him, and who presented it
with these words: "Venerable sir, this bowl worth eight ducats was given
me by my mother who is a lay devotee, and it is rightly obtained; let
the good lay devotee acquire merit." So efficacious is this act of
giving. And this is said:



A gift for taming the untamed,\
A gift for every kind of good;\
Through giving gifts they do unbend\
And condescend to kindly speech. \[307\]



\[The Breaking Down of the Barriers---The Sign\]



[40.] When his resentment towards that hostile person has been
thus allayed, then he can turn his mind with loving-kindness towards
that person too, just as towards the one who is dear, the very dear
friend, and the neutral person. Then he should break down the barriers
by practicing loving-kindness over and over again, accomplishing mental
impartiality towards the four persons, that is to say, himself, the dear
person, the neutral person and the hostile person.



[]



[]



[41.]The characteristic of it is this. Suppose this person is
sitting in a place with a dear, a neutral, and a hostile person, himself
being the fourth; then bandits come to him and say, "Venerable sir, give
us a bhikkhu," and on being asked why, they answer, "So that we may kill
him and use the blood of his throat as an offering;" then if that
bhikkhu thinks, "Let them take this one, or this one," he has not broken
down the barriers. And also if he thinks, "Let them take me but not
these three," he has not broken down the barriers either. Why? Because
he seeks the harm of him whom he wishes to be taken and seeks the
welfare of the other only. But it is when he does not see a single one
among the four people to be given to the bandits and he directs his mind
impartially towards himself and towards those three people that he has
broken down the barriers. Hence the Ancients said:



[42.] When he discriminates between The four, that is himself,
the dear,\
The neutral, and the hostile one,\
Then "skilled" is not the name he gets,\
Nor "having amity at will,"\
But only "kindly towards beings."\
Now, when a bhikkhu's barriers\
Have all the four been broken down,\
He treats with equal amity\
The whole world with its deities;\
Far more distinguished than the first\
Is he who knows no barriers.



[43.] Thus the sign and access are obtained by this bhikkhu
simultaneously with the breaking down of the barriers. But when breaking
down of the barriers has been effected, he reaches absorption in the way
described under the earth kasiṇa without trouble by cultivating,
developing, and repeatedly practicing that same sign.



At this point he has attained the first jhāna, which abandons five
factors, possesses five factors, is good in three ways, is endowed with
ten characteristics, and is accompanied by loving-kindness. And when
that has been obtained, then by cultivating, developing, and repeatedly
practicing that same sign, he successively reaches the second and third
jhānas in the fourfold system, and the second, third and fourth in the
fivefold system. \[308\]



\[Texts and Commentary\]



[44.]Now, it is by means of one of these jhānas beginning with
the first that he "Dwells pervading (intent upon) one direction with his
heart endued with loving- kindness, likewise the second direction,
likewise the third direction, likewise the fourth direction, and so
above, below, and around; everywhere and equally he dwells pervading the
entire world with his heart endued with loving- kindness, abundant,
exalted, measureless, free from enmity, and free from affliction" (Vibh
272; D I 250). For this versatility comes about only in one whose
consciousness has reached absorption in the first jhāna and the rest.



[]



[]



[45.] And here *endued with loving-kindness* means possessing
loving-kindness. *With his heart* (*cetasā*): with his mind (*cittena*).
*One direction*: this refers to anyone direction in which a being is
first discerned and means pervasion of the beings included in that one
direction. *Pervading*: touching, making his object. *He dwells*
(*viharati*): he causes the occurrence of an abiding
(*vihāra---*dwelling or continuation) in postures that is devoted to the
divine abidings (see IV.103). *Likewise the second*: just as he dwells
pervading anyone direction among those beginning with the eastern one,
so he does with the next one, and the third and the fourth, is the
meaning.



[46.] *So above*: in that same way in the upper direction is
what is meant. *Below,* *around*: so too the lower direction and the
direction all round. Herein, *below * is underneath, and *around * is in
the intermediate directions. So he sends his heart full of
loving-kindness back and forth in all directions like a horse in a
circus ground. Up to this point specified pervasion with loving-kindness
is shown in the discernment of each direction separately.



[47.]*Everywhere*, etc., is said for the purpose of showing
unspecified pervasion. Herein,  *everywhere * means in all places.
*Equally * (*sabbattatāya*): to all classed as inferior, medium,
superior, friendly, hostile, neutral, etc., just as to oneself
(*attatā*); equality with oneself (*atta*-*samatā*) without making the
distinction, "This is another being," is what is meant. Or
alternatively, *equally * (*sabbattatāya*) is with the whole state of
the mind; not reserving even a little, is what is meant. \[309\]
*Entire * (*sabbāvant*): possessing all beings (*sabbasattavant*);
associated with all beings, is the meaning. *World* is the world of
beings.



[48.] *Endued with loving-kindness* is said again here in order
to introduce the synonyms beginning with *abundant*. Or alternatively,
*endued with loving-kindness* is repeated because the word *likewise* or
the word *so* is not repeated here as it was in the case of the
\[preceding\] specified pervasion. Or alternatively, it is said as a way
of concluding. And *abundant * should be regarded here as abundance in
pervading. But it is *exalted * in plane \[from the sensual-sphere plane
to the fine- material-sphere plane\], *measureless * through familiarity
and through having measureless beings as its object, *free from enmity*
through abandonment of ill will and hostility, and *free from
affliction* through abandonment of grief; without suffering, is what is
meant. This is the meaning of the versatility described in the way
beginning, "With his heart endued with loving-kindness."



[49.]And just as this versatility is successful only in one
whose mind has reached absorption, so too that described in the
Paṭisambhidā should be understood to be successful only in one whose
mind has reached absorption, that is to say: "The mind-deliverance of
loving-kindness is \[practiced\] with unspecified pervasion in five
ways. The mind-deliverance of loving-kindness is \[practiced\] with
specified pervasion in seven ways. The mind-deliverance of
loving-kindness is \[practiced\] with directional pervasion in ten ways"
(Paṭis II 130).



[50.] And herein, the mind-deliverance of loving-kindness is
\[practiced\] with unspecified pervasion in these five ways: "May all
beings be free from enmity, affliction and anxiety, and live happily.
May all breathing things ... all creatures



[]



[]



... all persons ... all those who have a personality be free from
enmity, affliction and anxiety, and live happily" (Paṭis II 130).



[51.] The mind-deliverance of loving-kindness is \[practiced\]
with specified pervasion in these seven ways: "May all women be free
from enmity, affliction and anxiety and live happily. May all men ...
all Noble Ones ... all not Noble Ones ... all deities ... all human
beings ... all in states of loss be free from enmity, affliction and
anxiety, and live happily" (Paṭis II 131).



[52.] The mind-deliverance of loving-kindness is \[practiced\]
with directional pervasion in these ten ways: "May all beings in the
eastern direction be free from enmity, affliction and anxiety, and live
happily. May all beings in the western direction ... northern direction
... southern direction \[310\] ... eastern intermediate direction ...
western intermediate direction ... northern intermediate direction ...
southern intermediate direction ... downward direction ... upward
direction be free from enmity, affliction and anxiety, and live happily.
May all breathing things in the eastern direction ... May all creatures
in the eastern direction ... May all persons in the eastern direction
... May all who have a personality in the eastern direction ... \[etc.\]
... in the upward direction be free from enmity, affliction and anxiety,
and live happily. May all women in the eastern direction ... May all men
in the eastern direction ... May all Noble Ones in the eastern direction
... May all not Noble Ones in the eastern direction ... May all deities
in the eastern direction ... May all human beings in the eastern
direction ... May all those in states of loss in the eastern direction
... \[etc.\] *...* be free from enmity, affliction and anxiety, and live
happily" (Paṭis II 131).



[53.] Herein,  *all * signifies inclusion without exception.
*Beings * (*satta*): they are held (*satta*), gripped (*visatta*) by
desire and greed for the aggregates beginning with materiality, thus
they are beings (*satta*). For this is said by the Blessed One: "Any
desire for matter, Rādha, any greed for it, any delight in it, any
craving for it, has held (*satta*) it, has gripped (*visatta*) it, that
is why 'a being' (*satta*) is said" (S III 190). But in ordinary speech
this term of common usage is applied also to those who are without
greed, just as the term of common usage "palm fan" (*tālavaṇṭa*) is used
for different sorts of fans \[in general\] even if made of split bamboo.
However, \[in the world\] etymologists (*akkhara*-*cintaka*) who do not
consider meaning have it that it is a mere name, while those who do
consider meaning have it that a "being" (*satta*) is so called with
reference to the "bright principle" (*satta*).6



[54.]*Breathing things* (*pāṇa*): so called because of their
state of breathing (*pāṇanatā*); the meaning is, because their existence
depends on in-breaths and out-breaths. *Creatures* (*bhūta*): so called
because of being (*bhūtatta* = becomeness); the meaning\
is, because of their being fully become (*sambhūtatta*), because of
their being generated (*abhinibbattatta*).  *Persons * (*puggala*):
"*puṃ*" is what hell is called; they fall (*galanti*) into that, is the
meaning. *Personality* (*attabhāva*) is what the physical



6\. *Satta---*"the bright principle": Skr. *sattva*; one of the three
principles in the Sāṅkhya system, the other two being *rajas* (Pali:
*rajo*) or turbulence and *tamas* (Pali: *tamo*) or darkness. Not in
PED.



[]



[]



body is called; or it is just the pentad of aggregates, since it is
actually only a concept derived from that pentad of aggregates7 \[What
is referred to is\] included (*pariyāpanna*) in that personality, thus
it "has a personality" (*attabhāva- pariyāpanna*). "Included in" is
delimited by; "gone into" is the meaning.



[55.]And all the remaining \[terms\] should be understood as
synonyms for "all beings" used in accordance with ordinary speech as in
the case of the term "beings." Of course, \[311\] there are other
synonyms too for all "beings," such as all "folks," all "souls," etc.;
still it is for clarity's sake that "The mind-deliverance of
loving-kindness is \[practiced\] with unspecified pervasion in five
ways" is said and that only these five are mentioned.



[56.] Those who would have it that there is not only a mere
verbal difference between "beings," "breathing things," etc., but also
an actual difference in meaning, are contradicted by the mention of
unspecified pervasion. So instead of taking the meaning in that way, the
unspecified pervasion with loving- kindness is done in any one of these
five ways.



And here, *may all beings be free from enmity* is one absorption; *free
from affliction* is one absorption---free from affliction (*abyābajjha*)
is free from afflictedness (*byābādha*-*rahita*);8  *free from anxiety*
is one absorption---free from anxiety is free from suffering; *may they
live happily* is one absorption. Consequently he should do his pervading
with loving-kindness according to whichever of these phrases is clear to
him. So with the four kinds of absorption in each of the five ways,
there are twenty kinds of absorption in unspecified pervasion.



[57.] In specified pervasion, with the four kinds of absorption
in each of the seven ways, there are twenty-eight kinds of absorption.
And here "woman" and "man" are stated according to sex; "Noble Ones" and
"not Noble Ones" according to Noble Ones and ordinary people; "deities"
and "human beings" and "those in states of loss" according to the kind
of rebirth.



[58.] In directional pervasion, with twenty kinds of absorption
in each of the directions beginning with "all beings in the eastern
direction," there are two hundred kinds of absorption; and with
twenty-eight kinds in each of the directions beginning with "all women
in the eastern direction" there are two hundred and eighty kinds; so
these make four hundred and eighty kinds of absorption. Consequently all
the kinds of absorption mentioned in the Paṭisambhidā amount to five
hundred and twenty-eight.



7\. "Here when the aggregates are not fully understood, there is naming
(*abhidhāna*) of them and of the consciousness of them as self (*attā*),
that is to say, the physical body or alternatively the five aggregates.
'Derived from': apprehending, gripping, making a support. 'Since it is
actually a mere concept': because of presence (*sabbhāvato*) as a mere
concept in what is called a being, though in the highest sense the
'being' is non- existent" (Vism-mhṭ 298). See also Ch. VIII, note 11.\



8\. Harvard text reads *byāpādarahita*, which would be renderable as
"free from ill will." Vism-mhṭ (p. 299) supports a reading *byābādha*,
which seems better.



[]



[]



[59.]So when this meditator develops the mind-deliverance of
loving-kindness through any one of these kinds of absorption, he obtains
the eleven advantages described in the way beginning, "A man sleeps in
comfort" (§37).



[60.] Herein,  *sleeps in comfort* means that instead of
sleeping uncomfortably, turning over and snoring as other people do, he
sleeps comfortably, he falls asleep as though entering upon an
attainment.



[61.] He  *wakes in comfort*: instead of waking uncomfortably,
groaning and yawning and turning over as others do, he wakes comfortably
without contortions, like a lotus opening. \[312\]



[62.] He  *dreams no evil dreams*: when he sees dreams, he sees
only auspicious ones, as though he were worshipping a shrine, as though
he were making an offering, as though he were hearing the Dhamma. But he
does not see evil dreams as others do, as though being surrounded by
bandits, as though being threatened by wild beasts, as though falling
into chasms (see XIV, n. 45).



[63.]*He is dear to human beings*: he is as dear to and beloved
by human beings as a necklace worn to hang on the chest, as a wreath
adorning the head.



[64.]*He is dear to non-human beings*: he is just as dear to
non-human beings as he is to human beings, as in the Elder Visākha's
case. He was a landowner, it seems, at Pāṭaliputta (Patna). While he was
living there he heard this: "The Island of Tambapaṇṇi (Sri Lanka),
apparently, is adorned with a diadem of shrines and gleams with the
yellow cloth, and there a man can sit or lie wherever he likes; there
the climate is favourable, the abodes are favourable, the people are
favourable, the Dhamma to be heard is favourable, and all these
favourable things are easily obtained there."



[65.]He made over his fortune to his wife and children and left
his home with only a single ducat (*kahāpaṇa*) sewn into the hem of his
garment. He stopped for one month on the sea coast in expectation of a
ship, and meanwhile by his skill in trading he made a thousand during
the month by buying goods here and selling them there in lawful
enterprise.



[66.] Eventually he came to the Great Monastery \[(Mahāvihāra)
at Anurādha- pura\], and there he asked for the going forth into
homelessness. When he was being conducted to the chapter house (*sīmā*)
for the going-forth ceremony, the purse containing the thousand pieces
dropped out from under his belt. When asked "What is that?" he replied,
"It is a thousand ducats, venerable sirs." They told him, "Lay follower,
it is not possible to distribute them after the going forth. Distribute
them now." Then he said, "Let none who have come to the scene of
Visākha's going forth depart empty-handed," and opening \[the purse\] he
strewed them over the chapter house yard, after which he received the
going forth and the full admission.



[67.]When he had acquired five years' seniority and had become
familiar with the two Codes (Pātimokkha; see III.31) he celebrated the
*Pavāraṇā* at the end of the Rains, took a meditation subject that
suited him, and set out to wander, living for four months in each
monastery and doing the duties on a basis of equality with the
residents. While he was wandering in this way:



[]



[]



The elder halted in a wood\
To scan the tenor of his way;\
He thundered forth this roundelay\
Proclaiming that he found it good:\
So from your full-admission day\
Till in this place you paused and stood\
No stumbling mars your bhikkhuhood;\
Be thankful for such grace, I say. \[313\]



[68.]On his way to Cittalapabbata he came to a road fork and
stood wondering which turn to take. Then a deity living in a rock held
out a hand pointing out the road to him.



[69.] He came to the Cittalapabbata Monastery. After he had
stayed there for four months he lay down thinking, "In the morning I
depart." Then a deity living in a *maṇila* tree at the end of the walk
sat down on a step of the stair and burst into tears. The elder asked,
"Who is that?"---"It is I, Maṇiliyā, venerable sir."---"What are you
weeping for?"---"Because you are going away."---"What good does my
living here to you?"---"Venerable sir, as long as you live here non-
human beings treat each other kindly. Now, when you are gone, they will
start quarrels and loose talk."9 The elder said, "If my living here
makes you live at peace, that is good," and so he stayed there another
four months. Then he again thought of leaving, but the deity wept as
before. And so the elder lived on there, and it was there that he
attained Nibbāna.



This is how a bhikkhu who abides in loving-kindness is dear to non-human



beings.



[70.] *Deities guard him*: deities guard him as a mother and
father guard their child.



[71.]*Fire, poison and weapons do not affect him*: they do not
affect, do not enter into, the body of one who abides in
loving-kindness, like the fire in the case of the lay woman devotee
Uttarā (see XII.34 and Dhp-a III 310), like the poison in the case of
the Saṃyutta reciter the Elder Cūḷa-Siva, like the knife in the case of
the novice Saṅkicca (see Dhp-a II 249); they do not disturb the body, is
what is meant.



[72.]And they tell the story of the cow here too. A cow was
giving milk to her calf, it seems. A hunter, thinking "I shall shoot
her," flourished a long-handled spear in his hand and flung it. It
struck her body and bounced off like a palm leaf---and that was owing
neither to access nor to absorption, but simply to the strength of her
consciousness of love for her calf. So mightily powerful is loving-
kindness.



[73.]*His mind is easily concentrated*: the mind of one who
abides in loving-kindness is quickly concentrated, there is no
sluggishness about it. \[314\]



[74.] *The expression of his face is serene*: his face has a
serene expression, like a palmyra fruit loosed from its stem.



9\. For *duṭṭhulla* see Ch. IV, note 36. Here the meaning is more likely
to be "bad" or "lewd" than "inert."



[]



[]



[75.]*He dies unconfused*: there is no dying deluded for one
who abides in loving- kindness. He passes away undeluded as if falling
asleep.



[76.]*If he penetrates no higher*: if he is unable to reach
higher than the attainment of loving-kindness and attain Arahantship,
then when he falls from this life, he reappears in the Brahmā-world as
one who wakes up from sleep.



This is the detailed explanation of the development of loving-kindness.



\[(2) COMPASSION\]



[77.]One who wants to develop compassion should begin his task
by reviewing the danger in lack of compassion and the advantage in
compassion.



And when he begins it, he should not direct it at first towards the
dear, etc., persons; for one who is dear simply retains the position of
one who is dear, a very dear companion retains the position of a very
dear companion, one who is neutral retains the position of one who is
neutral, one who is antipathetic retains the position of one who is
antipathetic, and one who is hostile retains the position of one who is
hostile. One of the opposite sex and one who is dead are also not the
field for it.



[78.]In the Vibhaṅga it is said: "And how does a bhikkhu dwell
pervading one direction with his heart endued with compassion? Just as
he would feel compassion on seeing an unlucky, unfortunate person, so he
pervades all beings with compassion" (Vibh 273). Therefore first of all,
on seeing a wretched man, unlucky, unfortunate, in every way a fit
object for compassion, unsightly, reduced to utter misery, with hands
and feet cut off, sitting in the shelter for the helpless with a pot
placed before him, with a mass of maggots oozing from his arms and legs,
and moaning, compassion should be felt for him in this way: "This being
has indeed been reduced to misery; if only he could be freed from this
suffering!"



But if he does not encounter such a person, then he can arouse
compassion for an evil-doing person, even though he is happy, by
comparing him to one about to be executed. How?



[79.] Suppose a robber has been caught with stolen goods, and
in accordance with the king's command to execute him, the king's men
bind him and lead him off to the place of execution, giving him a
hundred blows in sets of four. Then people give him things to chew and
eat and also garlands and perfumes, unguents and betel leaves. Although
\[315\] he goes along eating and enjoying these things as though he were
happy and well off, still no one fancies that he is really happy and
well off. On the contrary people feel compassion for him, thinking,
"This poor wretch is now about to die; every step he takes brings him
nearer to the presence of death." So too a bhikkhu whose meditation
subject is compassion should arouse compassion for an \[evil-doing\]
person even if he is happy: "Though this poor wretch is now happy,
cheerful, enjoying his wealth, still for want of even one good deed done
now in any one of the three doors \[of body, speech and mind\] he can
come to experience untold suffering in the states of loss."

[]



[80.] Having aroused compassion for that person in that way, he
should next arouse compassion for a dear person, next for a neutral
person, and next for a hostile person, successively in the same way.



[81.] But if resentment towards the hostile person arises in
the way already described, he should make it subside in the way
described under loving-kindness (§§14--39).



And here too when someone has done profitable deeds and the meditator
sees or hears that he has been overtaken by one of the kinds of ruin
beginning with ruin of health, relatives, property, etc., he deserves
the meditator's compassion; and so he does too in any case, even with no
such ruin, thus "In reality he is unhappy," because he is not exempt
from the suffering of the round \[of becoming\]. And in the way already
described the meditator should break down the barriers between the four
kinds of people, that is to say, himself, the dear person, the neutral
person and the hostile person. Then cultivating that sign, developing it
and repeatedly practicing it, he should increase the absorption by the
triple and quadruple jhāna in the way already stated under
loving-kindness.



[82.]But the order given in the Aṅguttara Commentary is that a
hostile person should first be made the object of compassion, and when
the mind has been made malleable with respect to him, next the unlucky
person, next the dear person, and next oneself. That does not agree with
the text, "an unlucky, unfortunate person" (§78).Therefore he should
begin the development, break down the barriers, and increase absorption
only in the way stated here.



[83.] After that, the versatility consisting in the unspecified
pervasion in five ways, the specified pervasion in seven ways, and the
directional pervasion in ten ways, and the advantages described as "He
sleeps in comfort," etc., should be understood in the same way as given
under loving-kindness.



This is the detailed explanation of the development of compassion.
\[316\]



\[(3) GLADNESS\]



[84.]One who begins the development of gladness10 should not
start with the dear person and the rest; for a dear person is not the
proximate cause of gladness merely in virtue of dearness, how much less
the neutral and the hostile person. One of the opposite sex and one who
is dead are also not the field for it.



[85.]However, the very dear companion can be the proximate
cause for it---one who in the commentaries is called a "boon companion,"
for he is constantly glad: he laughs first and speaks afterwards. So he
should be the first to be pervaded with gladness. Or on seeing or
hearing about a dear person being happy, cheerful and glad, gladness can
be aroused thus: "This being is indeed glad. How good, how excellent!"
For this is what is referred to in the Vibhaṅga: "And how does a bhikkhu
dwell pervading one direction with his heart endued



10\. *Muditā---*"gladness" as one of the divine abidings is always in
the sense of gladness at others' success. Sometimes rendered as
"altruistic joy" and "sympathetic gladness."



[]



[]



with gladness? Just as he would be glad on seeing a dear and beloved
person, so he pervades all beings with gladness" (Vibh 274).



[86.]But if his boon companion or the dear person was happy in
the past but is now unlucky and unfortunate, then gladness can still be
aroused by remembering his past happiness and apprehending the glad
aspect in this way: "In the past he had great wealth, a great following
and he was always glad." Or gladness can be aroused by apprehending the
future glad aspect in him in this way: "In the future he will again
enjoy similar success and will go about in gold palanquins, on the backs
of elephants or on horseback, and so on."



Having thus aroused gladness with respect to a dear person, he can then



direct it successively towards a neutral one, and after that towards a
hostile one.



[87.]But if resentment towards the hostile one arises in him in
the way already described, he should make it subside in the same way as
described under loving- kindness (§§14--39).



He should break down the barriers by means of mental impartiality
towards the four, that is, towards these three and himself. And by
cultivating that sign, developing and repeatedly practicing it, he
should increase the absorption to triple and quadruple jhāna in the way
already stated under loving-kindness.



Next, the versatility consisting in unspecified pervasion in five ways,
specified pervasion in seven ways, and directional pervasion in ten
ways, and also the advantages described as "He sleeps in comfort," etc.,
should be understood in the same way as stated under loving-kindness.



This is the detailed explanation of the development of gladness.



\[317\]



\[(4) EQUANIMITY\]



[88.] One who wants to develop equanimity must have already
obtained the triple or quadruple jhāna in loving-kindness, and so on. He
should emerge from the third jhāna \[in the fourfold reckoning\], after
he has made it familiar, and he should see danger in the former \[three
divine abidings\] because they are linked with attention given to
beings' enjoyment in the way beginning "May they be happy," because
resentment and approval are near, and because their association with joy
is gross. And he should also see the advantage in equanimity because it
is peaceful. Then he should arouse equanimity (*upekkhā*) by looking on
with equanimity (*ajjhupekkhitvā*) at a person who is normally neutral;
after that at a dear person, and the rest. For this is said: "And how
does a bhikkhu dwell pervading one direction with his heart endued with
equanimity? Just as he would feel equanimity on seeing a person who was
neither beloved nor unloved, so he pervades all beings with equanimity"
(Vibh 275).



[89.]Therefore he should arouse equanimity towards the neutral
person in the way already stated. Then, through the neutral one, he
should break down the barriers in each case between the three people,
that is, the dear person, then the



[]



[]



boon companion, and then the hostile one, and lastly himself. And he
should cultivate that sign, develop and repeatedly practice it.



[90.]As he does so the fourth jhāna arises in him in the way
described under the earth kasiṇa.



But how then? Does this arise in one in whom the third jhāna has already
arisen on the basis of the earth kasiṇa, etc.? It does not. Why not?
Because of the dissimilarity of the object. It arises only in one in
whom the third jhāna has arisen on the basis of loving-kindness, etc.,
because the object is similar.



But after that the versatility and the obtaining of advantages should be



understood in the same way as described under loving-kindness.



This is the detailed explanation of the development of equanimity.



\[General\]



[91.] Now, having thus known these divine abidings Told by the
Divine One (*brahmā*) supremely \[wise\],\
There is this general explanation too\
Concerning them that he should recognize.



\[Meanings\]



[92.] Now, as to the meaning firstly of loving-kindness,
compassion, gladness and equanimity: it fattens (*mejjati*), thus it is
loving-kindness (*mettā*); it is solvent (*siniyhati*) is the meaning.
Also: it comes about with respect to a friend (*mitta*), \[318\] or it
is behaviour towards a friend, thus it is loving-kindness (*mettā*).



When there is suffering in others it causes (*karoti*) good people's
hearts to be moved (*kampana*), thus it is compassion (*karuṇā*). Or
alternatively, it combats (*kiṇāti*)11 others' suffering, attacks and
demolishes it, thus it is compassion. Or alternatively, it is scattered
(*kiriyati*) upon those who suffer, it is extended to them by pervasion,
thus it is compassion (*karuṇā*).



Those endowed with it are glad (*modanti*), or itself is glad
(*modati*), or it is the



mere act of being glad (*modana*), thus it is gladness (*muditā*).



It looks on at (*upekkhati*), abandoning such interestedness as thinking
"May they be free from enmity" and having recourse to neutrality, thus
it is equanimity (*upekkhā*).



\[Characteristic, Etc.\]



[93.] As to the characteristic, etc., *loving-kindness * is
characterized here as promoting the aspect of welfare. Its function is
to prefer welfare. It is manifested as the removal of annoyance. Its
proximate cause is seeing loveableness in beings. It succeeds when it
makes ill will subside, and it fails when it produces (selfish)
affection.



11\. *Kiṇāti---*"it combats": Skr. *kºnāti---*to injure or kill. PED
gives this ref. under ordinary meaning "to buy," which is wrong.



[]



[]



[94.]*Compassion * is characterized as promoting the aspect of
allaying suffering. Its function resides in not bearing others'
suffering. It is manifested as non- cruelty. Its proximate cause is to
see helplessness in those overwhelmed by suffering. It succeeds when it
makes cruelty subside and it fails when it produces sorrow.



[95.] *Gladness * is characterized as gladdening (produced by
others' success).12 Its function resides in being unenvious. It is
manifested as the elimination of aversion (boredom). Its proximate cause
is seeing beings, success. It succeeds when it makes aversion (boredom)
subside, and it fails when it produces merriment.



[96.]*Equanimity * is characterized as promoting the aspect of
neutrality towards beings. Its function is to see equality in beings. It
is manifested as the quieting of resentment and approval. Its proximate
cause is seeing ownership of deeds (kamma) thus: "Beings are owners of
their deeds. Whose13 \[if not theirs\] is the choice by which they will
become happy, or will get free from suffering, or will not fall away
from the success they have reached?" It succeeds when it makes
resentment and approval subside, and it fails when it produces the
equanimity of unknowing, which is that \[worldly-minded indifference of
ignorance\] based on the house life.



\[Purpose\]



[97.] The general purpose of these four divine abidings is the
bliss of insight and an excellent \[form of future\] existence. That
peculiar to each is respectively the warding off of ill will, and so on.
For here loving-kindness has the purpose of warding off ill will, while
the others have the respective purposes of warding off cruelty, aversion
(boredom), and greed or resentment. And this is said too: "For this is
the escape from ill will, friends, that is to say, the mind-deliverance
of loving-kindness ... For this is the escape from cruelty, friends,
that is to say, the mind-deliverance of compassion ... For this is the
escape from boredom, friends, that is to say, the mind-deliverance of
gladness ... For this is the escape from greed, friends, that is to say,
the mind-deliverance of equanimity" (D III 248).



\[The Near and Far Enemies\]



[98.]And here each one has two enemies, one near and one far.



The divine abiding of *loving-kindness * \[319\] has greed as its near
enemy,14 since both share in seeing virtues. Greed behaves like a foe
who keeps close by a man, and it easily finds an opportunity. So
loving-kindness should be well



12\. So Vism-mhṭ 309.\



13\. All texts read *kassa* (whose), which is confirmed in the quotation
translated in note 20. It is tempting, in view of the context, to read
*kammassa* (kamma's), but there is no authority for it. The statement
would then be an assertion instead of a question.



14\. "Greed is the near enemy of loving-kindness since it is able to
corrupt owing to its similarity, like an enemy masquerading as a friend"
(Vism-mhṭ 309).



[]



[]



protected from it. And ill will, which is dissimilar to the similar
greed, is its far enemy like a foe ensconced in a rock wilderness. So
loving-kindness must be practiced free from fear of that; for it is not
possible to practice loving-kindness and feel anger simultaneously (see
D III 247--48).



[99.]*Compassion * has grief based on the home life as its near
enemy, since both share in seeing failure. Such grief has been described
in the way beginning, "When a man either regards as a privation failure
to obtain visible objects cognizable by the eye that are sought after,
desired, agreeable, gratifying and associated with worldliness, or when
he recalls those formerly obtained that are past, ceased and changed,
then grief arises in him. Such grief as this is called grief based on
the home life" (M III 218). And cruelty, which is dissimilar to the
similar grief, is its far enemy. So compassion must be practiced free
from fear of that; for it is not possible to practice compassion and be
cruel to breathing things simultaneously.



[100.] *Gladness* has joy based on the home life as its near
enemy, since both share in seeing success. Such joy has been described
in the way beginning, "When a man either regards as gain the obtaining
of visible objects cognizable by the eye that are sought ... and
associated with worldliness, or recalls those formerly obtained that are
past, ceased, and changed, then joy arises in him. Such joy as this is
called joy based on the home life" (M III 217). And aversion (boredom),
which is dissimilar to the similar joy, is its far enemy. So gladness
should be practiced free from fear of that; for it is not possible to
practice gladness and be discontented with remote abodes and things
connected with the higher profitableness simultaneously.



[101.] *Equanimity * has the equanimity of unknowing based on
the home life as its near enemy, since both share in ignoring faults and
virtues. Such unknowing has been described in the way beginning, "On
seeing a visible object with the eye equanimity arises in the foolish
infatuated ordinary man, in the untaught ordinary man who has not
conquered his limitations, who has not conquered future \[kamma\]
result, who is unperceiving of danger. Such equanimity as this does not
surmount the visible object. Such equanimity as this is called
equanimity based on the home life" (M III 219). And greed and
resentment, which are dissimilar to the similar unknowing, are its far
enemies. Therefore equanimity must be practiced free from fear of that;
\[320\] for it is not possible to look on with equanimity and be
inflamed with greed or be resentful15 simultaneously.



\[The Beginning, Middle and End, Etc.\]



[102.] Now, zeal consisting in desire to act is the beginning
of all these things.



Suppression of the hindrances, etc., is the middle. Absorption is the
end. Their



15\. *Paṭihaññati---*"to be resentful": not in PED; the verb has been
needed to correspond to "resentment" (*paṭigha*), as the verb, "to be
inflamed with greed" (*rajjati*) corresponds with "greed" (*rāga*).



[]



[]



object is a single living being or many living beings, as a mental
object consisting in a concept.



\[The Order in Extension\]



[103.] The extension of the object takes place either in access
or in absorption. Here is the order of it. Just as a skilled ploughman
first delimits an area and then does his ploughing, so first a single
dwelling should be delimited and loving- kindness developed towards all
beings there in the way beginning, "In this dwelling may all beings be
free from enmity." When his mind has become malleable and wieldy with
respect to that, he can then delimit two dwellings. Next he can
successively delimit three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
one street, half the village, the whole village, the district, the
kingdom, one direction, and so on up to one world-sphere, or even beyond
that, and develop loving- kindness towards the beings in such areas.
Likewise with compassion and so on. This is the order in extending here.



\[The Outcome\]



[104.] Just as the immaterial states are the outcome of the
kasiṇas, and the base consisting of neither perception nor
non-perception is the outcome of concentration, and fruition attainment
is the outcome of insight, and the attainment of cessation is the
outcome of serenity coupled with insight, so the divine abiding of
equanimity is the outcome of the first three divine abidings. For just
as the gable rafters cannot be placed in the air without having first
set up the scaffolding and built the framework of beams, so it is not
possible to develop the fourth (jhāna in the fourth divine abiding)
without having already developed the third jhāna in the earlier (three
divine abidings).



\[Four Questions\]



[105.] And here it may be asked: But why are loving-kindness,
compassion, gladness, and equanimity, called divine abidings? And why
are they only four? And what is their order? And why are they called
measureless states in the Abhidhamma?



[106.]It may be replied: The divineness of the abiding
(*brahmavihāratā*) should be understood here in the sense of best and in
the sense of immaculate. For these abidings are the best in being the
right attitude towards beings. And just as Brahmā gods abide with
immaculate minds, so the meditators who associate themselves with these
abidings abide on an equal footing with Brahmā gods. So they are called
divine abidings in the sense of best and in the sense of immaculate.
\[321\]



[107.] Here are the answers to the questions beginning with
"Why are they only four?":



Their number four is due to paths to purity\
And other sets of four; their order to their aim\
As welfare and the rest. Their scope is found to be\
Immeasurable, so "measureless states" their name.



[]



[]



[108.] For among these, loving-kindness is the way to purity
for one who has much ill will, compassion is that for one who has much
cruelty, gladness is that for one who has much aversion (boredom), and
equanimity is that for one who has much greed. Also attention given to
beings is only fourfold, that is to say, as bringing welfare, as
removing suffering, as being glad at their success, and as unconcern,
\[that is to say, impartial neutrality\]. And one abiding in the
measureless states should practice loving-kindness and the rest like a
mother with four sons, namely, a child, an invalid, one in the flush of
youth, and one busy with his own affairs; for she wants the child to
grow up, wants the invalid to get well, wants the one in the flush of
youth to enjoy for long the benefits of youth, and is not at all
bothered about the one who is busy with his own affairs. That is why the
measureless states are only four as "due to paths to purity and other
sets of four."



[109.] One who wants to develop these four should practice them
towards beings first as the promotion of the aspect of welfare---and
loving-kindness has the promotion of the aspect of welfare as its
characteristic; and next, on seeing or hearing or judging16 that beings
whose welfare has been thus wished for are at the mercy of suffering,
they should be practiced as the promotion of the aspect of the removal
of suffering---and compassion has the promotion of the aspect of the
removal of suffering as its characteristic; and then, on seeing the
success of those whose welfare has been wished for and the removal of
whose suffering has been wished for, they should be practiced as being
glad---and gladness has the act of gladdening as its characteristic; but
after that there is nothing to be done and so they should be practiced
as the neutral aspect, in other words, the state of an onlooker---and
equanimity has the promotion of the aspect of neutrality as its
characteristic; therefore, since their respective aims are the aspect of
welfare, etc., their order should be understood to correspond, with
loving- kindness stated first, then compassion, gladness and equanimity.



[110.]All of them, however, occur with a measureless scope, for
their scope is measureless beings; and instead of assuming a measure
such as "Loving- kindness, etc., should be developed only towards a
single being, or in an area of such an extent," they occur with
universal pervasion.



That is why it was said: \[322\]



Their number four is due to paths to purity\
And other sets of four; their order to their aim\
As welfare and the rest. Their scope is found to be\
Immeasurable, so "measureless states" their name.



\[As Producing Three Jhānas and Four Jhānas\]



[111.]Though they have a single characteristic in having a
measureless scope, yet the first three are only of triple and quadruple
jhāna \[respectively in the fourfold and fivefold reckonings\]. Why?
Because they are not dissociated from



16\. *Sambhāvetvā---*"judging": not in this sense in PED. Vism-mhṭ (p.
313) explains by *parikappetvā* (conjecturing).



[]



[]



joy. But why are their aims not dissociated from joy? Because they are
the escape from ill will, etc., which are originated by grief. But the
last one belongs only to the remaining single jhāna. Why? Because it is
associated with equanimous feeling. For the divine abiding of equanimity
that occurs in the aspect of neutrality towards beings does not exist
apart from equanimous \[that is to say, neither- painful-nor-pleasant\]
feeling.



[112.] However, someone might say this: "It has been said by
the Blessed One in the Book of Eights, speaking of the measureless
states in general: 'Next, bhikkhu, you should develop the concentration
with applied thought and sustained thought, and you should develop it
without applied thought and with sustained thought only, and you should
develop it without applied thought and without sustained thought, and
you should develop it with happiness, and you should develop it without
happiness, and you should develop it accompanied by gratification, and
you should develop it accompanied by equanimity' (A IV 300).
Consequently all four measureless states have quadruple and quintuple
jhāna."



[113.] He should be told: "Do not put it like that. For if that
were so, then contemplation of the body, etc., would also have quadruple
and quintuple jhāna. But there is not even the first jhāna in the
contemplation of feeling or in the other two.17 So do not misrepresent
the Blessed One by adherence to the letter. The Enlightened One's word
is profound and should be taken as it is intended, giving due weight to
the teachers."



[114.] And the intention here is this: The Blessed One, it
seems, was asked to teach the Dhamma thus: "Venerable sir, it would be
good if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief, so that,
having heard the Blessed One's Dhamma, I may dwell alone, withdrawn,
diligent, ardent and self-exerted" (A IV 299). But the Blessed One had
no confidence yet in that bhikkhu, since although he had already heard
the Dhamma he had nevertheless gone on living there instead of going to
do the ascetic's duties, \[and the Blessed One expressed his lack of
confidence\] thus: "So too, some misguided men merely question me, and
when the Dhamma is expounded \[to them\], they still fancy that they
need not follow me" (A IV 299). However, the bhikkhu had the
potentiality for the attainment of Arahantship, and so he advised him
again, \[323\] saying: "Therefore, bhikkhu, you should train thus: 'My
mind shall be steadied, quite steadied internally, and arisen evil
unprofitable things shall not obsess my mind and



17\. For which kinds of body contemplation give which kinds of
concentration see 8.43 and M-a I 247.\



18\. *"'Mere unification of the mind'*: the kind of concentrating
(*samādhāna*) that is undeveloped and just obtained by one in pursuit of
development. That is called 'basic concentration,' however, since it is
the basic reason for the kinds of more distinguished concentration to be
mentioned later in this connection. This 'mere unification of the mind'
is intended as momentary concentration as in the passage beginning, 'I
internally settled, steadied, unified and concentrated my mind' (M I
116). For the first unification of the mind is recognized as momentary
concentration here as it is in the first of the two successive
descriptions: 'Tireless energy was aroused in me ... my mind was
concentrated and unified' followed by 'Quite secluded from sense desires
...'" (M I 21) (Vism-mhṭ 314).



[]



[]



remain.' You should train thus" (A IV 299). But what is stated in that
advice is basic concentration consisting in mere unification of mind18 
internally in the sense of in oneself (see Ch. XIV, n. 75).



[115.] After that he told him about its development by means of
loving-kindness in order to show that he should not rest content with
just that much but should intensify his basic concentration in this way:
"As soon as your mind has become steadied, quite steadied internally,
bhikkhu, and arisen evil unprofitable things do not obsess your mind and
remain, then you should train thus: 'The mind- deliverance of
loving-kindness will be developed by me, frequently practiced, made the
vehicle, made the foundation, established, consolidated, and properly
undertaken.' You should train thus, bhikkhu" (A IV 299--300), after
which he said further: "As soon as this concentration has been thus
developed by you, bhikkhu,19 and frequently practiced, then you should
develop this concentration with applied thought and sustained thought
... and you should develop it accompanied by equanimity" (A IV 300).



[116.] The meaning is this: "Bhikkhu, when this basic
concentration has been developed by you by means of loving-kindness,
then, instead of resting content with just that much, you should make
this basic concentration reach quadruple and quintuple jhāna in other
objects by \[further\] developing it in the way beginning 'With applied
thought.'"



[117.] And having spoken thus, he further said: "As soon as
this concentration has been thus developed by you, bhikkhu, and
frequently practiced, then you should train thus: 'The mind-deliverance
of compassion will be developed by me ...' (A IV 300), etc., pointing
out that "you should effect its \[further\] development by means of
quadruple and quintuple jhāna in other objects, this \[further\]
development being preceded by the remaining divine abidings of
compassion and the rest."



[118.] Having thus shown how its \[further\] development by
means of quadruple and quintuple jhāna is preceded by loving-kindness,
etc., and having told him, "As soon as this concentration has been
developed by you, bhikkhu, and frequently practiced, then you should
train thus: 'I shall dwell contemplating the body as a body,'" etc., he
concluded the discourse with Arahantship as its culmination thus: "As
soon as this concentration has been developed by you, bhikkhu,
completely developed, then wherever you go you will go in comfort,
wherever you stand you will stand in comfort, wherever \[324\] you sit
you will sit in comfort, wherever you make your couch you will do so in
comfort" (A IV 301). From that it must be understood that the \[three\]
beginning with loving-kindness have only triple-quadruple jhāna, and
that equanimity has only the single



19\. "'*Thus developed*': just as a fire started with wood and banked up
with cowdung, dust, etc., although it arrives at the state of a 'cowdung
fire,' etc., (cf. M I 259) is nevertheless called after the original
fire that was started with the wood, so too it is the basic
concentration that is spoken of here, taking it as banked up with
loving- kindness, and so on. 'In other objects' means in such objects as
the earth kasiṇa" (Vism-mhṭ 315).



[]



[]



remaining jhāna. And they are expounded in the same way in the
Abhidhamma as well.



\[The Highest Limit of Each\]



[119.] And while they are twofold by way of the
triple-quadruple jhāna and the single remaining jhāna, still they should
be understood to be distinguishable in each case by a different efficacy
consisting in having "beauty as the highest," etc. For they are so
described in the Haliddavasana Sutta, according as it is said:
"Bhikkhus, the mind-deliverance of loving-kindness has beauty as the
highest, I say ... The mind-deliverance of compassion has the base
consisting of boundless space as the highest, I say ... The
mind-deliverance of gladness has the base consisting of boundless
consciousness as the highest I say ... The mind- deliverance of
equanimity has the base consisting of nothingness as the highest, I say"
(S V 119--21).20



[120.] But why are they described in this way? Because each is
the respective basic support for each. For beings are unrepulsive to one
who abides in loving- kindness. Being familiar with the unrepulsive
aspect, when he applies his mind to unrepulsive pure colours such as
blue-black, his mind enters into them without difficulty. So
loving-kindness is the basic support for the liberation by the beautiful
(see M II 12; M-a III 256), but not for what is beyond that. That is why
it is called "having beauty as the highest."



[121.] One who abides in compassion has come to know thoroughly
the danger in materiality, since compassion is aroused in him when he
sees the suffering of beings that has as its material sign (cause)
beating with sticks, and so on. So, well knowing the danger in
materiality, when he removes whichever kasiṇa \[concept he was
contemplating\], whether that of the earth kasiṇa or another, and
applies his mind to the space \[that remains (see X.6)\], which is the
escape from materiality, then his mind enters into that \[space\]
without difficulty. So compassion is the basic support for the sphere of
boundless space, but not for what is beyond that. That is why it is
called "having the base consisting of boundless space as the highest."



[122.] When he abides in gladness, his mind becomes familiar
with apprehending consciousness, since gladness is aroused in him when
he sees beings' consciousness arisen in the form of rejoicing over some
reason for joy. Then when he surmounts the sphere of boundless space
that he had already attained in due course and applies his mind to the
consciousness that had as its object the sign of space, \[325\] his mind
enters into it without difficulty. So gladness is the basic support for
the base consisting of boundless consciousness, but not for what is
beyond that. That is why it is called "having the sphere of boundless
consciousness as the highest."



20\. "The beautiful" (*subha*) is the third of the eight liberations
(*vimokkha---*see M II 12; M-a III 255).\



21\. Reading in both cases "*avijjamāna-gahaṇa-dakkhaṃ cittaṃ*," not
"-*dukkhaṃ*." "'*Because it has no more concern*  (*ābhoga*)': because
it has no further act of being concerned



[]



[]



[123.] When he abides in equanimity, his mind becomes skilled21
in appre- hending what is (in the ultimate sense) non-existent, because
his mind has been diverted from apprehension of (what is existent in)
the ultimate sense, namely, pleasure, (release from) pain, etc., owing
to having no further concern such as "May beings be happy" or "May they
be released from pain" or "May they not lose the success they have
obtained." Now his mind has become used to being diverted from
apprehension of \[what is existent in\] the ultimate sense, and his mind
has become skilled in apprehending what is non-existent in the ultimate
sense, (that is to say, living beings, which are a concept), and so when
he surmounts the base consisting of boundless consciousness attained in
due course and applies his mind to the absence, which is non-existent as
to individual essence, of consciousness, which is a reality (is
become---see M I 260) in the ultimate sense, then his mind enters into
that (nothingness, that non-existence) without difficulty (see X.32). So
equanimity is the basic support for the base consisting of nothingness,
but not for what is beyond that. That is why it is called "having the
base consisting of nothingness as the highest."



[124.] When he has understood thus that the special efficacy of
each resides respectively in "having beauty as the highest," etc., he
should besides understand how they bring to perfection all the good
states beginning with giving. For the Great Beings' minds retain their
balance by giving preference to beings' welfare, by dislike of beings'
suffering, by desire for the various successes achieved by beings to
last, and by impartiality towards all beings. And to all beings they
give *gifts*, which are a source a pleasure, without discriminating
thus: "It must be given to this one; it must not be given to this one."
And in order to avoid doing harm to beings they undertake the precepts
of *virtue*. They practice *renunciation * for the purpose of perfecting
their virtue. They cleanse their *understanding* for the purpose of
non-confusion about what is good and bad for beings. They constantly
arouse *energy*, having beings' welfare and happiness at heart. When
they have acquired heroic fortitude through supreme energy, they become 
*patient * with beings' many kinds of faults. They *do not deceive* when



(*ābhujana*) by hoping (*āsiṃsanā*) for their pleasure, etc., thus 'May
they be happy.' The development of loving-kindness, etc., occurring as
it does in the form of hope for beings' pleasure, etc., makes them its
object by directing \[the mind\] to apprehension of \[what is existent
in\] the ultimate sense \[i.e. pleasure, etc.\]. But development of
equanimity, instead of occurring like that, makes beings its object by
simply looking on. But does not the divine abiding of equanimity itself
too make beings its object by directing the mind to apprehension of
\[what is existent in\] the ultimate sense, because of the words,
'Beings are owners of their deeds. Whose \[if not theirs\] is the choice
by which they will become happy ...?' (§96)---Certainly that is so. But
that is in the prior stage of development of equanimity. When it has
reached its culmination, it makes beings its object by simply looking
on. So its occurrence is specially occupied with what is non-existent in
the ultimate sense \[i.e. beings, which are a concept\]. And so skill in
apprehending the non-existent should be understood as avoidance of
bewilderment due to misrepresentation in apprehension of beings, which
avoidance of bewilderment has reached absorption" (Vism-mhṭ).



[]



[]



promising "We shall give you this; we shall do this for you." They are
unshakably *resolute* upon beings' welfare and happiness. Through
unshakable *loving-kindness* they place them first \[before
themselves\]. Through *equanimity * they expect no reward. Having thus
fulfilled the \[ten\] perfections, these \[divine abidings\] then
perfect all the good states classed as the ten powers, the four kinds of
fearlessness, the six kinds of knowledge not shared \[by disciples\],
and the eighteen states of the Enlightened One.22 This is how they bring
to perfection all the good states beginning with giving.

Concentration in the *Path of Purification* composed for the purpose of

## CHAPTER X 


THE IMMATERIAL STATES



(*Āruppa-niddesa*)



\[(1) THE BASE CONSISTING OF BOUNDLESS SPACE\]



[1.] \[326\] Now, as to the four immaterial states mentioned
next to the divine abidings (III.105), one who wants firstly to develop
the base consisting of boundless space sees in gross physical matter
danger through the wielding of sticks, etc., because of the words: "'It
is in virtue of matter that wielding of sticks, wielding of knives,
quarrels, brawls and disputes takes place; but that does not exist at
all in the immaterial state,' and in this expectation he enters upon the
way to dispassion for only material things, for the fading and cessation
of only those" (M I 410); and he sees danger in it too through the
thousand afflictions beginning with eye disease. So, in order to
surmount that, he enters upon the fourth jhāna in any one of the nine
kasiṇas beginning with the earth kasiṇa and omitting the limited-space
kasiṇa.



[2.]Now, although he has already surmounted gross physical
matter by means of the fourth jhāna of the fine-material sphere,
nevertheless he still wants also to surmount the kasiṇa materiality
since it is the counterpart of the former. How does he do this?



[3.]Suppose a timid man is pursued by a snake in a forest and
flees from it as fast as he can, then if he sees in the place he has
fled to a palm leaf with a streak painted on it or a creeper or a rope
or a crack in the ground, he is fearful, anxious and will not even look
at it. Suppose again a man is living in the same village as a hostile
man who ill-uses him and on being threatened by him with a flogging and
the burning down of his house, he goes away to live in another village,
then if he meets another man there of similar appearance, voice and
manner, he is fearful, anxious and will not even look at him.



[4.]Here is the application of the similes. The time when the
bhikkhu has the gross physical matter as his object is like the time
when the men were respectively threatened by the snake and by the enemy.
\[327\] The time when the bhikkhu surmounts the gross physical matter by
means of the fourth jhāna of the fine- material sphere is like the first
man's fleeing as fast as he can and the other man's going away to
another village. The bhikkhu's observing that even the matter of the
kasiṇa is the counterpart of that gross physical matter and his wanting
to surmount that also is like the first man's seeing in the place he had


[]



[]



šfled to the palm leaf with a streak painted on it, etc., and the other
man's seeing the man who resembled the enemy in the village he had left,
and their unwillingness to look owing to fear and anxiety.



And here the similes of the dog attacked by a boar and that of the
*pisāca* goblin



and the timid man1  should be understood too.



[5.] So when he has thus become disgusted with (dispassionate
towards) the kasiṇa materiality, the object of the fourth jhāna, and
wants to get away from it, he achieves mastery in the five ways. Then on
emerging from the now familiar fourth jhāna of the fine-material sphere,
he sees the danger in that jhāna in this way: "This makes its object the
materiality with which I have become disgusted," and "It has joy as its
near enemy," and "It is grosser than the peaceful liberations." There
is, however, no \[comparative\] grossness of factors here \[as in the
case of the four fine-material jhānas\]; for the immaterial states have
the same two factors as this fine-material \[jhāna\].



[6.] When he has seen the danger in that \[fine-material fourth
jhāna\] jhāna in this way and has ended his attachment to it, he gives
his attention to the base consisting of boundless space as peaceful.
Then, when he has spread out the kasiṇa to the limit of the
world-sphere, or as far as he likes, he removes the kasiṇa
\[materiality\] by giving his attention to the space touched by it,
\[regarding that\] as "space" or "boundless space."



[7.]When he is removing it, he neither folds it up like a mat
nor withdraws it like a cake from a tin. It is simply that he does not
advert to it or give attention to it or review it; it is when he neither
adverts to it nor gives attention to it nor reviews it, but gives his
attention exclusively to the space touched by it, \[regarding that\] as
"space, space," that he is said to "remove the kasiṇa."



[8.]And when the kasiṇa is being removed, it does not roll up
or roll away. It is simply that it is called "removed" on account of his
non-attention to it, his attention being given to "space, space." This
is conceptualized as the mere space left by the removal of the kasiṇa
\[materiality\]. Whether it is called "space left by the removal of the
kasiṇa" or "space touched by the kasiṇa" or "space secluded from the
kasiṇa," it is all the same.



[9.]He adverts again and again to the sign of the space left by
the removal of the kasiṇa \[328\] as "space, space," and strikes at it
with thought and applied thought. As he adverts to it again and again
and strikes at it with thought and applied thought, the hindrances are
suppressed, mindfulness is established and his mind becomes concentrated
in access. He cultivates that sign again and again, develops and
repeatedly practices it.



[10.] As he again and again adverts to it and gives attention
to it in this way,



consciousness belonging to the base consisting of boundless space arises
in



1\. "A dog, it seems, was attacked in the forest by a boar and fled.
When it was dusk he saw in the distance a cauldron for boiling rice, and
perceiving it as a boar, he fled in fear and terror. Again, a man who
was afraid of *pisāca* goblins saw a decapitated palm stump at night in
a place that was unfamiliar to him, and perceiving it as a *pisāca*
goblin, he fell down in his fear, horror and confusion" (Vism-mhṭ 320).



CHAPTER  X



The Immaterial States

[]



absorption with the space \[as its object\], as the consciousness
belonging to the fine-material sphere did in the case of the earth
kasiṇa, and so on. And here too in the prior stage there are either
three or four sensual-sphere impulsions associated with equanimous
feeling, while the fourth or the fifth is of the immaterial sphere. The
rest is the same as in the case of the earth kasiṇa (IV.74).



[11.]There is, however, this difference. When the
immaterial-sphere conscious- ness has arisen in this way, the bhikkhu,
who has been formerly looking at the kasiṇa disk with the jhāna eye
finds himself looking at only space after that sign has been abruptly
removed by the attention given in the preliminary work thus "space,
space." He is like a man who has plugged an opening in a \[covered\]
vehicle, a sack or a pot2 with a piece of blue rag or with a piece of
rag of some such colour as yellow, red or white and is looking at that,
and then when the rag is removed by the force of the wind or by some
other agency, he finds himself looking at space.



\[Text and Commentary\]



[12.]And at this point it is said: "With the complete
surmounting (*samatikkamā*) of perceptions of matter, with the
disappearance of perceptions of resistance, with non-attention to
perceptions of variety, \[aware of\] 'unbounded space,' he enters upon
and dwells in the base consisting of boundless space" (Vibh 245).



[13.] Herein, *complete* is in all aspects or of all
\[perceptions\]; without exception, is the meaning. *Of perceptions of
matter*: both (a) of the fine-material jhānas mentioned \[here\] under
the heading of "perception," and (b) of those things that are their
object. For (a) the jhāna of the fine-material sphere is called "matter"
in such passages as "Possessed of visible matter he sees instances of
matter" (D II 70; M II 12), and (b) it is its object too \[that is
called "matter"\] in such passages as "He sees instances of visible
matter externally ... fair and ugly" (D II 110; M II 13).3 Consequently,
here the words "perception of matter" (*rūpa*-*saññā---*lit.
"matter-perceptions"), in the sense of "perceptions about matter," are
used (a) for fine-material jhāna stated thus under the headings of
"perceptions." \[Also\] (b) it has the label (*saññā*) "matter"
(*rūpa*), thus it (the jhāna's object) is "labelled matter"
(*rūpa*-*saññā*); what is meant is that "matter" is its name. So it
should be understood that this is also a term for (b) what is classed as
the earth kasiṇa, etc., which is the object of that \[jhāna\].4 \[329\]



2\. PED, this ref. reads *yānapuṭosā* for *yānapatoḷi*, taking it as one
compound (see under *yāna* and *mutoḷī*, but this does not fit the
context happily. Vism-mhṭ (p. 321) has: "'*Yānappatoḷikumbhimukhādīnan*'
*ti oguṇṭhana-sivikādi-yānaṃ mukhaṃ = yāna-mukhaṃ;\
patoḷiyā kuddakadvārassa mukhaṃ = patoḷi-mukhaṃ; kumbhi-mukhan ti
paccekaṃ mukha-\
saddo sambandhitabbo*." This necessitates taking *yāna* separately.



3\. These two quotations refer respectively to the first of the eight
liberations and the first of the eight bases of mastery (See M-a III
255ff.).



4\. This explanation depends on a play on the word *saññā* as the
\[subjective\] perception and as the \[objective\] sign, signal or label
perceived.



[]



[]



[14.]*With the surmounting*: with the fading away and with the
cessation. What is meant? With the fading away and with the cessation,
both because of the fading away and because of the cessation, either in
all aspects or without exception, of these perceptions of matter,
reckoned as jhāna, which number fifteen with the \[five each of the\]
profitable, resultant and functional,5 and also of these things labelled
matter, reckoned as objects \[of those perceptions\], which number nine
with the earth kasiṇa, etc., (§1) he enters upon and dwells in the base
consisting of boundless space. For he cannot enter upon and dwell in
that without completely surmounting perceptions of matter.



[15.]Herein, there is no surmounting of these perceptions in
one whose greed for the object \[of those perceptions\] has not faded
away; and when the perceptions have been surmounted, their objects have
been surmounted as well. That is why in the Vibhaṅga only the
surmounting of the perceptions and not that of the objects is mentioned
as follows: "Herein, what are perceptions of matter? They are the
perception, perceiving, perceivedness, in one who has attained a fine-
material-sphere attainment or in one who has been reborn there or in one
who is abiding in bliss there in this present life. These are what are
called perceptions of matter. These perceptions of matter are passed,
surpassed, surmounted. Hence, 'With the complete surmounting of
perceptions of matter' is said" (Vibh 261). But this commentary should
be understood to deal also with the surmounting of the object because
these attainments have to be reached by surmounting the object; they are
not to be reached by retaining the same object as in the first and
subsequent jhānas.



[16.] *With the disappearance of perceptions of resistance*:
perceptions of resistance are perceptions arisen through the impact of
the physical base consisting of the eye, etc., and the respective
objects consisting of visible objects etc.; and this is a term for
perception of visible objects (*rūpa*) and so on, according as it is
said: "Here, what are perceptions of resistance? Perceptions of visible
objects, perceptions of sounds, perceptions of odours, perceptions of
flavours, perceptions of tangible objects---these are called
'perceptions of resistance'" (Vibh 261); with the complete
disappearance, the abandoning, the non-arising, of these ten kinds of
perceptions of resistance, that is to say, of the five
profitable-resultant and five unprofitable-resultant;6 causing their
non-occurrence, is what is meant.



[17.]Of course, these are not to be found in one who has
entered upon the first jhāna, etc., either; for consciousness at that
time does not occur by way of the five doors. Still \[330\] the mention
of them here should be understood as a recommendation of this jhāna for
the purpose of arousing interest in it, just as in the case of the
fourth jhāna there is mention of the pleasure and pain already abandoned
elsewhere, and in the case of the third path there is mention of the
\[false\] view of personality, etc., already abandoned earlier.



5\. See XIV.129, description of perception aggregate, which is
classified in the same way as the consciousness aggregate. Those
referred to here are the fifteen fine- material kinds, corresponding to
nos. (9--l3), (57--61) and (81--85) in Table III.



6\. See XIV.96f. nos. (34--38) and (50--54) in Table III.



CHAPTER  X



The Immaterial States



[]



[]



[18.] Or alternatively, though these are also not to be found
in one who has attained the fine-material sphere, still their not being
there is not due to their having been abandoned; for development of the
fine-material sphere does not lead to fading of greed for materiality,
and the occurrence of those \[fine-material jhānas\] is actually
dependent on materiality. But this development \[of the immaterial\]
does lead to the fading of greed for materiality. Therefore it is
allowable to say that they are actually abandoned here; and not only to
say it, but to maintain it absolutely.



[19.]In fact it is because they have not been abandoned already
before this that it was said by the Blessed One that sound is a thorn to
one who has the first jhāna (A V 135). And it is precisely because they
are abandoned here that the imperturbability (see Vibh 135) of the
immaterial attainments and their state of peaceful liberation are
mentioned (M I 33), and that Āḷāra Kālāma neither saw the five hundred
carts that passed close by him nor heard the sound of them while he was
in an immaterial attainment (D II 130).



[20.]*With non-attention to perceptions of variety*: either to
perceptions occurring with variety as their domain or to perceptions
themselves various. For "perceptions of variety" are so called \[for two
reasons\]: firstly, because the kinds of perception included along with
the mind element and mind-consciousness element in one who has not
attained---which kinds are intended here as described in the Vibhaṅga
thus: "Herein, what are perceptions of variety? The perception,
perceiving, perceivedness, in one who has not attained and possesses
either mind element or mind- consciousness element in one who has not
attained and possesses either mind element or mind-consciousness
element: these are called 'perceptions of variety'" (Vibh 261)---occur
with respect to a domain that is varied in individual essence with the
variety classed as visible-object, sound, etc.; and secondly, because
the forty-four kinds of perception---that is to say, eight kinds of
sense-sphere profitable perception, twelve kinds of unprofitable
perception, eleven kinds of sense-sphere profitable resultant
perception, two kinds of unprofitable-resultant perception, and eleven
kinds of sense-sphere functional perception---themselves have variety,
have various individual essences, and are dissimilar from each other.
With the complete non-attention to, non-adverting to, non-reaction to,
non-reviewing of, these perceptions of variety; what is meant is that
because he does not advert to them, give them attention or review them,
therefore ...



[21.]And \[two things\] should be understood: firstly, that
their absence is stated here in two ways as "surmounting" and
"disappearance" because the earlier perceptions of matter and
perceptions of resistance do not exist even in the kind of existence
produced by this jhāna on rebirth, let alone when this jhāna is entered
upon and dwelt in that existence; \[331\] and secondly, in the case of
perceptions of variety, "non-attention" to them is said because
twenty-seven kinds of perception---that is to say, eight kinds of
sense-sphere profitable perception, nine kinds of functional perception,
and ten kinds of unprofitable perception---still exist in the kind of
existence produced by this jhāna. For when he enters upon and dwells in
this jhāna there too, he does so by non-attention to them also, but he
has not attained when he does give attention to them.



[]



[]



[22.]And here briefly it should be understood that the
abandoning of all fine- material-sphere states is signified by the words
*with the surmounting of perceptions of matter*, and the abandoning of
and non-attention to all sense-sphere consciousness and its concomitants
is signified by the words *with the disappearance of perceptions of
resistance, with non-attention to perceptions of variety*.



[23.]*Unbounded space*: here it is called "unbounded"
(*ananta*, lit. endless) because neither its end as its arising nor its
end as its fall are made known.7 It is the space left by the removal of
the kasiṇa that is called "space." And here unboundedness (endlessness)
should be understood as \[referring to\] the attention also, which is
why it is said in the Vibhaṅga: "He places, settles his consciousness in
that space, he pervades unboundedly (*anantaṃ)*, hence 'unbounded
(*ananto*) space' is said" (Vibh 262).



[24.] *He enters upon and dwells in the base consisting of
boundless space*: it has no bound (*anta*), and thus it is unbounded
(*ananta*). What is spatially unbounded (*ākāsaṃ anantaṃ*) is unbounded
space (*ākāsānantaṃ*). Unbounded space is the same as boundless space
(*ākāsānañcaṃ---*lit. space-boundlessness). That "boundless space" is a
"base" (*āyatana*) in the sense of habitat for the jhāna whose nature it
is to be associated with it, as the "deities' base" is for deities, thus
it is the "base consisting of boundless space" (*ākāsānañcāyatana*). *He
enters and dwells in*: having reached that base consisting of boundless
space, having caused it to be produced, he dwells (*viharati*) with an
abiding (*vihāra*) consisting in postures that are in conformity with
it.



This is the detailed explanation of the base consisting of boundless
space as



a meditation subject.



\[(2) THE BASE CONSISTING OF BOUNDLESS CONSCIOUSNESS\]



[25.]When he wants to develop the base consisting of boundless
consciousness, he must first achieve mastery in the five ways in the
attainment of the base consisting of boundless space. Then he should see
the danger in the base consisting of boundless space in this way: "This
attainment has fine-material jhāna as its near enemy, and it is not as
peaceful as the base consisting of boundless consciousness." So having
ended his attachment to that, he should give his attention to the base
consisting of boundless consciousness as peaceful, adverting again and
again as "consciousness, consciousness" to the consciousness that
occurred pervading that space \[as its object\]. He should give it
attention, review it, and strike at it with applied and sustained
thought; \[332\] but he should not give attention \[simply\] in this way
"boundless, boundless."8



7\. "A \[formed\] dhamma with an individual essence is delimited by rise
and fall because it is produced after having not been, and because after
having been it vanishes. But space is called boundless since it has
neither rise nor fall because it is a dhamma without individual essence"
(Vism-mhṭ 323).\



8\. "He should not give attention to it only as 'Boundless, boundless;'
instead of developing it thus, he should give attention to it as
'Boundless consciousness, boundless consciousness' or as 'Consciousness,
consciousness'" (Vism-mhṭ 324).



CHAPTER  X



The Immaterial States



[]



[]



[26.] As he directs his mind again and again on to that sign in
this way, the hindrances are suppressed, mindfulness is established, and
his mind becomes concentrated in access. He cultivates that sign again
and again, develops and repeatedly practices it. As he does so,
consciousness belonging to the base consisting of boundless
consciousness arises in absorption with the \[past\] consciousness that
pervaded the space \[as its object\], just as that belonging to the base
consisting of boundless space did with the space \[as its object\]. But
the method of explaining the process of absorption should be understood
in the way already described.



\[Text and Commentary\]



[27.] And at this point it is said: "By completely surmounting
(*samatikkamma*) the base consisting of boundless space, \[aware of\]
'unbounded consciousness,' he enters upon and dwells in the base
consisting of boundless consciousness" (Vibh 245).



[28.] Herein,  *completely* is as already explained. By ...
*surmounting the base* *consisting of boundless space*: the jhāna is
called the "base consisting of boundless space" in the way already
stated (§24), and its object is so called too. For the object, too, is
"boundless space" (*ākāsānañcaṃ*) in the way already stated (§24), and
then, because it is the object of the first immaterial jhāna, it is its
"base" in the sense of habitat, as the "deities' base" is for deities,
thus it is the "base consisting of boundless space." Likewise: it is
"boundless space," and then, because it is the cause of the jhāna's
being of that species, it is its "base" in the sense of locality of the
species, as Kambojā is the "base" of horses, thus it is the "base
consisting of boundless space" in this way also. So it should be
understood that the words, "By ... surmounting the base consisting of
boundless space" include both \[the jhāna and its object\] together,
since this base consisting of boundless consciousness is to be entered
upon and dwelt in precisely by surmounting, by causing the
non-occurrence of, and by not giving attention to, both the jhāna and
its object.



[29.]*Unbounded consciousness*: What is meant is that he gives
his attention thus "unbounded consciousness" to that same consciousness
that occurred in pervading \[as its object the space\] as "unbounded
space." Or "unbounded" refers to the attention. For when he gives
attention without reserve to the consciousness that had the space as its
object, then the attention he gives to it is "unbounded."



[30.] For it is said in the Vibhaṅga: "'Unbounded
consciousness': he gives attention to that same space pervaded by
consciousness, he pervades boundlessly, hence 'unbounded consciousness'
is said" (Vibh 262). But in that passage (*taṃ yeva ākāsaṃ viññāṇena
phuṭaṃ*) the instrumental case "by consciousness" must be understood in
the sense of accusative; for the teachers of the commentary explain its
meaning in that way. What is meant by "He pervades boundlessly" is that
"he gives attention to that same consciousness which had pervaded that
space" (*taṃ yeva ākāsaṃ phuṭaṃ viññāṇaṃ*).



[]



[]



[31.] *He enters upon and dwells in the base consisting of
boundless consciousness*: \[333\] it has no bound (*anta*, lit. end),
thus it is unbounded (*ananta*). What is unbounded is boundless
(*ānañca* lit. unboundedness), and unbounded consciousness is called
"boundless consciousness," that is "*viññāṇañcaṃ*" \[in the contracted
form\] instead of "*viññāṇānañcaṃ*" \[which is the full number of
syllables\]. This is an idiomatic form. That boundless consciousness
(*viññāṇañca*) is the base (*āyatana*) in the sense of foundation for
the jhāna whose nature it is to be associated with it, as the "deities'
base" is for deities, thus it is the "base consisting of boundless
consciousness" (*viññāṇañcāyatana*). The rest is the same as before.



This is the detailed explanation of the base consisting of boundless



consciousness as a meditation subject.



\[(3) THE BASE CONSISTING OF NOTHINGNESS\]



[32.]When he wants to develop the base consisting of
nothingness, he must first achieve mastery in the five ways in the
attainment in the base consisting of boundless consciousness. Then he
should see the danger in the base consisting of boundless consciousness
in this way: "This attainment has the base consisting of boundless space
as its near enemy, and it is not as peaceful as the base consisting of
nothingness." So having ended his attachment to that, he should give his
attention to the base consisting of nothingness as peaceful. He should
give attention to the \[present\] non-existence, voidness, secluded
aspect, of that same \[past\] consciousness belonging to the base
consisting of boundless space, which became the object of \[the
consciousness belonging to\] the base consisting of boundless
consciousness. How does he do this?



[33.] Without giving \[further\] attention to that
consciousness, he should \[now\] advert again and again in this way,
"there is not, there is not," or "void, void," or "secluded, secluded,"
and give his attention to it, review it, and strike at it with thought
and applied thought.



[34.]As he directs his mind on to that sign thus, the
hindrances are suppressed, mindfulness is established, and his mind
becomes concentrated in access. He cultivates that sign again and again,
develops and repeatedly practices it. As he does so, consciousness
belonging to the base consisting of nothingness arises in absorption,
making its object the void, secluded, non-existent state of that same
\[past\] exalted consciousness that occurred in pervading the space,
just as the \[consciousness belonging to the\] base consisting of
boundless consciousness did the \[then past\] exalted consciousness that
had pervaded the space. And here too the method of explaining the
absorption should be understood in the way already described.



[35.]But there is this difference. Suppose a man sees a
community of bhikkhus gathered together in a meeting hall or some such
place and then goes elsewhere; then after the bhikkhus have risen at the
conclusion of the business for which they had met and have departed, the
man comes back, and as he stands in the doorway looking at that place
again, he sees it only as void, he sees it only as secluded, he does not
think, "So many bhikkhus have died, so many have left the

district," but rather \[334\] he sees only the non-existence thus, "This
is void, secluded"---so too, having formerly dwelt seeing with the jhāna
eye belonging to the base consisting of boundless consciousness the
\[earlier\] consciousness that had occurred making the space its object,
\[now\] when that consciousness has disappeared owing to his giving
attention to the preliminary work in the way beginning, "There is not,
there is not," he dwells seeing only its non- existence, in other words,
its departedness when this consciousness has arisen in absorption.



\[Text and Commentary\]



[36.]And at this point it is said: "By completely surmounting
the base consisting of boundless consciousness, \[aware that\] 'There is
nothing,' he enters upon and dwells in the base consisting of
nothingness" (Vibh 245).



[37.] Herein,  *completely* is as already explained. By ...
*surmounting the base* *consisting of boundless consciousness*: here too
the jhāna is called the "base consisting of boundless consciousness" in
the way already stated, and its object is so-called too. For the object
too is "boundless consciousness" (*viññāṇañcaṃ*) in the way already
stated, and then, because it is the object of the second immaterial
jhāna, it is its "base" in the sense of habitat, as the "deities' base"
is for deities, thus it is the "base consisting of boundless
consciousness." Likewise it is "boundless consciousness," and then
because it is the cause of the jhāna's being of that species, it is its
"base" in the sense of locality of the species, as Kambojā is the "base"
of horses, thus it is the "base consisting of boundless consciousness"
in this way also. So it should be understood that the words, "By ...
surmounting the base consisting of boundless consciousness" include both
\[the jhāna and its object\] together, since this base consisting of
nothingness is to be entered upon and dwelt in precisely by surmounting,
by causing the non- occurrence of, by not giving attention to, both
jhāna and its object.



[38.] *There is nothing* (*natthi kiñci*): what is meant is
that he gives his attention thus, "there is not, there is not," or
"void, void," or "secluded, secluded." It is said in the Vibhaṅga:
"'There is nothing': he makes that same consciousness non-existent,
makes it absent, makes it disappear, sees that 'there is nothing', hence
'there is nothing' is said" (Vibh 262), which is expressed in a way that
resembles comprehension \[by insight\] of liability to destruction,
nevertheless the meaning should be understood in the way described
above. For the words "He makes that same consciousness non-existent,
makes it absent, makes it disappear" are said of one who does not advert
to it or gives attention to it or review it, and only gives attention to
its non-existence, its voidness, its secludedness; they are not meant in
the other way (Cf. XXI.17).



[39.]*He enters upon and dwells in the base consisting of
nothingness*: it has no owning (*kiñcana*),9 this it is non-owning
(*akiñcana*); what is meant is that it has not even



9\. There is a play on the words *natthi kiñci* ("there is nothing") and
*akiñcana* ("non- owning"). At M I 298 there occurs the expression
"*Rāgo kho āvuso kiñcano* (greed, friend, is an owning)," which is used
in connection with this attainment. The



[]



[]



the mere act of its dissolution remaining. The state (essence) of
non-owning is nothingness (*ākiñcañña*). This is a term for the
disappearance of the consciousness belonging to the base consisting of
boundless space. \[335\] That nothingness is the "base" in the sense of
foundation for that jhāna, as the "deities' base" is for deities, thus
it is the "base consisting of nothingness." The rest is as before.



This is the detailed explanation of the base consisting of nothingness
as a



meditation subject.



\[(4) THE BASE CONSISTING OF NEITHER PERCEPTION NOR NON-PERCEPTION\]



[40.] When, however, he wants to develop the base consisting of
neither perception nor non-perception, he must first achieve mastery in
the five ways in the attainment of the base consisting of nothingness.
Then he should see the danger in the base consisting of nothingness and
the advantage in what is superior to it in this way: "This attainment
has the base consisting of boundless consciousness as its near enemy,
and it is not as peaceful as the base consisting of neither perception
nor non-perception," or in this way: "Perception is a boil, perception
is a dart ... this is peaceful, this is sublime, that is to say, neither
perception nor non-perception" (M II 231). So having ended his
attachment to the base consisting of nothingness, he should give
attention to the base consisting of neither perception non
non-perception as peaceful. He should advert again and again to that
attainment of the base consisting of nothingness that has occurred
making non-existence its object, adverting to it as "peaceful,
peaceful," and he should give his attention to it, review it and strike
at it with thought and applied thought.



[41.] As he directs his mind again and again on to that sign in
this way, the hindrances are suppressed, mindfulness is established, and
his mind becomes concentrated in access. He cultivates that sign again
and again, develops and repeatedly practices it. As he does so,
consciousness belonging to the base consisting of neither perception nor
non-perception arises in absorption making its object the four
\[mental\] aggregates that constitute the attainment of the base
consisting of nothingness, just as the \[consciousness belonging to
the\] base consisting of nothingness did the disappearance of the
\[previous\] consciousness. And here too the method of explaining the
absorption should be understood in the way already described.



\[Text and Commentary\]



[42.]And at this point it is said: "By completely surmounting
the base consisting of nothingness he enters upon and dwells in the base
consisting of neither perception nor non-perception" (Vibh 245).



commentary (M-a II 354) says "*Rāgo uppajjitvā puggalaṃ kiñcati,
maddati, palibujjhati, tasmā kiñcano ti vutto* (greed having arisen
owns, presses, impedes, a person, that is why it is called an owning)"
(Cf. M-a I 27; also XXI.53 and note 19). Vism-mhṭ (p. 327) here says
"*Kiñcanan ti kiñci pi*." The word *kiñcati* is not in PED.



CHAPTER  X



The Immaterial States



[]



[]



[43.] Herein, *completely* is already explained. *By* ...
*surmounting the base consisting* *of nothingness*: here too the jhāna
is called the "base consisting of nothingness" in the way already
stated, and its object is so called too. For the object too is
"nothingness" (*ākiñcaññaṃ*) in the way already stated, and then because
it is the object of the third immaterial jhāna, it is its "base" in the
sense of habitat, as the "deities' base" is for deities, thus it is the
"base consisting of nothingness." Likewise: it is "nothingness," and
then, because it is the cause of the jhāna's being of that species, it
is its "base" in the sense of locality of the species, as Kambojā is the
"base" of horses, thus it is the "base consisting of nothingness" in
this way also. \[336\] So it should be understood that the words, "By
... surmounting the base consisting of nothingness" include both \[the
jhāna and its object\] together, since the base consisting of neither
perception nor non- perception is to be entered upon and dwelt in
precisely by surmounting, by causing the non-occurrence of, by not
giving attention to, both the jhāna and its object.



[44.]*Base consisting of neither perception nor
non-perception*: then there is he who so practices that there is in him
the perception on account of the presence of which this \[attainment\]
is called the "the base consisting of neither perception nor
non-perception," and in the Vibhaṅga, in order to point out that
\[person\], firstly one specified as "neither percipient nor
non-percipient," it is said, "gives attention to that same base
consisting of nothingness as peaceful, he develops the attainment with
residual formations, hence 'neither percipient nor non- percipient' is
said" (Vibh 263).



[45.] Herein, *he gives attention* ... *as peaceful*, means
that he gives attention to it as "peaceful" because of the peacefulness
of the object thus: "How peaceful this attainment is; for it can make
even non-existence its object and still subsist!"



If he brings it to mind as "peaceful" then how does there come to be
surmounting? Because there is no actual desire to attain it. For
although he gives attention to it as "peaceful," yet there is no concern
in him or reaction or attention such as "I shall advert to this" or "I
shall attain this" or "I shall resolve upon \[the duration of\] this."
Why not? Because the base consisting of neither perception nor
non-perception is more peaceful and better than the base consisting of
nothingness.



[46.]Suppose a king is proceeding along a city street with the
great pomp of royalty,10 splendidly mounted on the back of an elephant,
and he sees craftsmen wearing one cloth tightly as a loin-cloth and
another tied round their heads, working at the various crafts such as
ivory carving, etc., their limbs covered with ivory dust, etc.; now
while he is pleased with their skill, thinking, "How skilled these
craft-masters are, and what crafts they practice!" he does not, however,
think, "Oh that I might abandon royalty and become a craftsman like
that!" Why not? Because of the great benefits in the majesty of kings;
he leaves the craftsmen behind and proceeds on his way. So too, though
this \[meditator\] gives



10\. *Mahacca* (see D I 49 and D-a I 148); the form is not given in PED;
probably a form of *mahatiya*.



[]



[]



attention to that attainment as "peaceful," yet there is no concern in
him or reaction or attention such as "I shall advert to this attainment"
or "I shall attain this" or "I shall resolve upon \[the duration of\]
it" or "I shall emerge from it" or "I shall review it."



[47.]As he gives attention to it as "peaceful" in the way
already described, \[337\] he reaches the ultra-subtle absorbed
perception in virtue of which he is called "neither percipient nor
non-percipient," and it is said of him that "He develops the attainment
with residual formations."



*The attainment with residual formations* is the fourth immaterial
attainment



whose formations have reached a state of extreme subtlety.



[48.]Now, in order to show the meaning of the kind of
perception that has been reached, on account of which \[this jhāna\] is
called the "base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception,"
it is said: "'Base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception':
states of consciousness or its concomitants in one who has attained the
base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception or in one who
has been reborn there or in one who is abiding in bliss there in this
present life" (Vibh 263). Of these, what is intended here is the states
of consciousness and its concomitants in one who has attained.



[49.]The word meaning here is this: that jhāna with its
associated states neither has perception nor has no perception because
of the absence of gross perception and the presence of subtle
perception, thus it is "neither perception nor non- perception" (*n'
eva*-*saññā-nāsaññaṃ*). It is "neither perception nor non-perception"
and it is a "base" (*āyatana*) because it is included in the mind-base
(*manāyatana*) and the mental-object base (*dhammāyatana*), thus it is
the "base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception"
(*nevasaññānāsaññāyatana*).



[50.] Or alternatively: the perception here is neither
perception, since it is incapable of performing the decisive function of
perception, nor yet non- perception, since it is present in a subtle
state as a residual formation, thus it is "neither perception nor
non-perception." It is "neither perception nor non- perception" and it
is a "base" in the sense of a foundation for the other states, thus it
is the "base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception."



And here it is not only perception that is like this, but feeling as
well is neither-feeling-nor-non-feeling, consciousness is
neither-consciousness-nor- non-consciousness, and contact is
neither-contact-nor-non-contact, and the same description applies to the
rest of the associated states; but it should be understood that this
presentation is given in terms of perception.



[51.]And the meaning should be illustrated by the similes
beginning with the smearing of oil on the bowl. A novice smeared a bowl
with oil, it seems, and laid it aside. When it was time to drink gruel,
an elder told him to bring the bowl. He said, "Venerable sir, there is
oil in the bowl." But then when he was told, "Bring the oil, novice, I
shall fill the oil tube," he replied, "There is no oil, venerable sir."
Herein, just as "There is oil" is in the sense of incompatibility with
the gruel because it has been poured into \[the bowl\] and just as
"There is no oil" is in the sense of filling the oil tube, etc., so too
this perception is "neither perception" since



CHAPTER  X



The Immaterial States



[]



[]



it is incapable of performing the decisive function of perception and it
is "nor non- perception" because it is present in a subtle form as a
residual formation. \[338\]



[52.]But in this context what is perception's function? It is
the perceiving of the object, and it is the production of dispassion if
\[that attainment and its object are\] made the objective field of
insight. But it is not able to make the function of perceiving decisive,
as the heat element in tepid11 water is not able to make the function of
burning decisive; and it is not able to produce dispassion by treatment
of its objective field with insight in the way that perception is in the
case of the other attainments.



[53.]There is in fact no bhikkhu capable of reaching dispassion
by comprehension of aggregates connected with the base consisting of
neither perception nor non- perception unless he has already done his
interpreting with other aggregates (see XX.2f. and XXI.23). And
furthermore, when the venerable Sāriputta, or someone very wise and
naturally gifted with insight as he was, is able to do so, even he has
to do it by means of comprehension of groups (XX.2) in this way, "So it
seems, these states, not having been, come to be; having come to be,
they vanish" (M III 28), and not by means of \[actual direct\] insight
into states one by one as they arise. Such is the subtlety that this
attainment reaches.



[54.]And this meaning should be illustrated by the simile of
the water on the road, as it was by the simile of the oil-smearing on
the bowl. A novice was walking in front of an elder, it seems, who had
set out on a journey. He saw a little water and said, "There is water,
venerable sir, remove your sandals." Then the elder said, "If there is
water, bring me the bathing cloth and let us bathe," but the novice
said, "There is none, venerable sir." Herein, just as "There is water"
is in the sense of mere wetting of the sandals, and "There is none" is
in the sense of bathing, so too, this perception is "neither perception"
since it is incapable of performing the decisive function of perception,
and it is "nor non-perception" because it is present in a subtle form as
a residual formation.



[55.] And this meaning should be illustrated not only by these
similes but by other appropriate ones as well.



*Enters upon and dwells in* is already explained.



This is the detailed explanation of the base consisting of neither
perception



nor non-perception as a meditation subject.



\[*GENERAL*\]



[56.] Thus has the Peerless Helper told The fourfold immaterial
state;\
To know these general matters too\
Will not be inappropriate.



[57.] For these immaterial states:\
While reckoned by the surmounting of



11\. *Sukhodaka---*"tepid water": see Monier Williams' *Sanskrit
Dictionary*; this meaning of *sukha* not given in PED.



[]



[]



The object they are four, the wise\
Do not admit surmounting of\
Factors that one can recognize.



[58.] Of these \[four\], the first is due to surmounting signs
of materiality, the second is due to surmounting space, the third is due
to surmounting the consciousness that occurred with that space as its
object, and the fourth is due to surmounting the disappearance of the
consciousness that occurred with that space as its object. So they
should be understood as four in number with the surmounting of the
object in each case. \[339\] But the wise do not admit any surmounting
of \[jhāna\] factors; for there is no surmounting of factors in them as
there is in the case of the fine-material-sphere attainments. Each one
has just the two factors, namely equanimity and unification of mind.



[59.] That being so:



They progress in refinement; each\
Is finer than the one before.\
Two figures help to make them known;\
The cloth lengths, and each palace floor.



[60.]Suppose there were a four-storied palace: on its first
floor the five objects of sense pleasure were provided in a very fine
form as divine dancing, singing and music, and perfumes, scents,
garlands, food, couches, clothing, etc., and on the second they were
finer than that, and on the third finer still, and on the fourth they
were finest of all; yet they are still only palace floors, and there is
no difference between them in the matter of their state (essence) as
palace floors; it is with the progressive refinement of the five objects
of sense pleasure that each one is finer than the one below;---again
suppose there were lengths of cloth of quadruple, triple, double and
single thickness, and \[made\] of thick, thin, thinner, and very thin
thread spun by one woman, all the same measure in width and breadth; now
although these lengths of cloth are four in number, yet they measure the
same in width and breadth, there is no difference in their measurement;
but in softness to the touch, fineness, and costliness each is finer
than the one before;--- so too, although there are only the two factors
in all four \[immaterial states\], that is to say, equanimity and
unification of mind, still each one should be understood as finer than
the one before with the progressive refinement of factors due to
successful development.



[61.]And for the fact that each one of them is finer than the
last \[there is this figure:\]



One hangs upon a tent that stands\
On filth; on him another leans.\
Outside a third not leaning stands,\
Against the last another leans.\
Between the four men and these states\
The correspondence then is shown,\
And so how each to each relates\
Can by a man of wit be known.



CHAPTER  X



The Immaterial States



[]



[]



[62.]This is how the meaning should be construed. There was a
tent in a dirty place, it seems. Then a man arrived, and being disgusted
with the dirt, he rested himself on the tent with his hands and remained
as if hung or hanging on to it. Then another man came and leant upon the
man hanging on to the tent. Then another man came and thought, "The one
who is hanging on to the tent and the one who is leaning upon him are
both badly off, and if the tent falls they will certainly fall. I think
I shall stand outside." \[340\] So instead of leaning upon the one
leaning upon the first, he remained outside. Then another arrived, and
taking account of the insecurity of the one hanging on to the tent and
the one leaning upon him, and fancying that the one standing outside was
well placed, he stood leaning upon him.



[63.]Herein, this is how it should be regarded. The space from
which the kasiṇa has been removed is like the tent in the dirty place.
The \[consciousness of the\] base consisting of boundless space, which
makes space its object owing to disgust with the sign of the
fine-material, is like the man who hangs on to the tent owing to disgust
with the dirt. The \[consciousness of the\] base consisting of boundless
consciousness, the occurrence of which is contingent upon \[the
consciousness of\] the base consisting of boundless space whose object
is space, is like the man who leans upon the man who hangs on to the
tent. The \[consciousness of the\] base consisting of nothingness, which
instead of making \[the consciousness of the\] base consisting of
boundless space its object has the non-existence of that as its object,
is like the man who, after considering the insecurity of those two, does
not lean upon the one hanging on to the tent, but stands outside. The
\[consciousness of the\] base consisting of neither perception nor
non-perception, the occurrence of which is contingent upon \[the
consciousness of\] the base consisting of nothingness, which stands in a
place outside, in other words, in the non-existence of \[the past\]
consciousness, is like the man who stands leaning upon the last-named,
having considered the insecurity of the one hanging on to the tent and
the one leaning upon him, and fancying that the one standing outside is
well placed.



[64.] And while occurring in this way: It takes this for its
object since\
There is no other one as good,\
As men depend upon a king,\
Whose fault they see, for livelihood.



[65.] For although this \[consciousness of the\] base
consisting of neither perception nor non-perception has seen the flaw in
the base consisting of nothingness in this way, "This attainment has the
base consisting of boundless consciousness as its near enemy,"
notwithstanding that fact it takes it as its object in the absence of
any other. Like what? As men for the sake of livelihood depend on kings
whose faults they see. For just as, for the sake of livelihood and
because they cannot get a livelihood elsewhere, people put up with some
king, ruler of all quarters, who is unrestrained, and harsh in bodily,
verbal, and mental behaviour, though they see his faults thus, "He is
harshly behaved," so too the \[consciousness of the\] base consisting of
neither perception nor non-perception



[]



[]



takes that base consisting of nothingness as its object in spite of
seeing its faults in this way, and it does so since it cannot find
another \[better\] object.



[66.] As one who mounts a lofty stair Leans on its railings for
a prop,\
As one who climbs an airy peak\
Leans on the mountain's very top,\
As one who stands on a crag's edge\
Leans for support on his own knees---\
Each jhāna rests on that below;\
For so it is with each of these.

## CHAPTER XI 


CONCENTRATION---CONCLUSION:



NUTRIMENT AND THE ELEMENTS



(*Samādhi-niddesa*)



\[PERCEPTION  OF  REPULSIVENESS  IN  NUTRIMENT\]



[1.] \[341\] Now comes the description of the development of
the perception of repulsiveness in nutriment, which was listed as the
"one perception"1 next to the immaterial states (III.105).



Herein, it nourishes (*āharati*, lit. "brings on"), thus it is nutriment
(*āhāra*, lit. "bringing on"). That is of four kinds as: physical
nutriment, nutriment consisting of contact, nutriment consisting of
mental volition, and nutriment consisting of consciousness.2



1\. "The word 'perception' (*saññā*) is used for the *dhamma* with the
characteristic of perceiving (*sañjānana*), as in the case of
'perception of visible objects,' 'perception of sound,' etc.; and it is
used for insight, as in the case of 'perception of impermanence,'
'perception of suffering,' etc.; and it is used for serenity, as in the
passage, 'Perception of the bloated and perception of visible objects,
have these one meaning or different meanings, Sopāka?' (*Source
untraced.* Cf. III.111), and so on. Here, however, it should be
understood as the preliminary work for serenity; for it is the
apprehending of the repulsive aspect in nutriment, or the access jhāna
produced by means of that, that is intended here by, 'perception of
repulsiveness in nutriment'"(Vism-mhṭ 334--35).



2\. A more detailed exposition of nutriment is given at M-a I 107ff.
"'It nourishes' (*āharati*)": the meaning is that it leads up, fetches,
produces, its own fruit through its state as a condition for the fruit's
arising or presence, which state is called "nutriment condition." It is
made into a mouthful (*kabalaṃ karīyati*), thus it is physical
(*kabaliṅkāra*). In this way it gets its designation from the concrete
object; but as to characteristic, it should be understood to have the
characteristic of nutritive essence (*ojā*). It is physical and it is
nutriment in the sense stated, thus it is physical nutriment; so with
the rest. It touches (*phusati*), thus it is contact (*phassa*); for
although this is an immaterial state, it occurs also as the aspect of
touching on an object (*ārammaṇa---*lit. "what is to be leaned on"),
which is why it is said to have the characteristic of touching. It wills
(*cetayati*), thus it is volition (*cetanā*); the meaning is that it
arranges (collects) itself together with associated states upon the
object. Mental volition is volition occupied with the mind. It cognizes
(*vijānāti*) by conjecturing about rebirth (see XVII.303), thus it is
consciousness (*viññāṇa* = cognition) (Vism-mhṭ 335).


[]



[]



[2.] But what is it here that nourishes (brings on) what?
Physical nutriment (*kabaliṅkārāhāra*) nourishes (brings on) the
materiality of the octad that has nutritive essence as eighth:3 contact
as nutriment nourishes (brings on) the three kinds of feeling; mental
volition as nutriment nourishes (brings on) rebirth- linking in the
three kinds of becoming; consciousness as nutriment nourishes (brings
on) mentality-materiality at the moment of rebirth-linking.



3\.



Now, when there is physical nutriment there is attachment, which brings
peril; when there is nutriment as contact there is approaching, which
brings peril; when there is nutriment as mental volition there is
rebirth-linking, which brings peril.4 And to show how they bring fear
thus, physical nutriment should be illustrated by the simile of the
child's flesh (S II 98), contact as nutriment by the simile of the
hideless cow (S II 99), mental volition as nutriment by the simile of
the pit of live coals (S II 99), and consciousness as nutriment by the
simile of the hundred spears (S II 100).



[4.]But of these four kinds of nutriment it is only physical
nutriment, classed as what is eaten, drunk, chewed, and tasted, that is
intended here as "nutriment" in this sense. The perception arisen as the
apprehension of the repulsive aspect in that nutriment is, "perception
of repulsiveness in nutriment."



3\. For the "octad with nutritive essence as eighth" (*ojaṭṭhamaka),*
see XVIII.5ff. and XX.27ff.\



4\. Vism-mhṭ (p. 355) explains *attachment* here as craving which is
"perilous because it brings harm" (see e.g. D II 58--59), or in other
words, "greed for the five aggregates (lust after five-aggregate
experience)." It cites the following: "Bhikkhus, when there is physical
nutriment, there is greed (lust), there is delighting, there is craving;
consciousness being planted therein grows. Wherever consciousness being
planted grows, there is the combination of mind-and-matter. Wherever
there is the combination of mind-and-matter, there is ramification of
formations. Wherever there is ramification of formations, there is
production of further becoming in the future. Wherever there is
production of further becoming in the future, there is future birth,
aging and death. Wherever there is future birth, aging and death,
bhikkhus, the end is sorrow, I say, with woe and despair" (S II 101; cf.
S II 66). *Approaching * is explained as "meeting, coinciding, with
unabandoned perversions \[of perception\] due to an object \[being
perceived as permanent, etc., when it is not\]." That is, "perilous
since it is not free from the three kinds of suffering." The quotation
given is: "Bhikkhus, due to contact of the kind to be felt as pleasant,
pleasant feeling arises. With that feeling as condition there is
craving, ... thus there is the arising of this whole mass of suffering"
(cf. S IV 215). *Reappearance* is "rebirth in some kind of becoming or
other. Being flung into a new becoming is perilous because there is no
immunity from the risks rooted in reappearance." The following is
quoted: "Not knowing, bhikkhus, a man forms the formation of merit, and
his \[rebirth\] consciousness accords with the merit \[tie performed\];
he forms the formation of demerit; ... he forms the formation of the
imperturbable ..." (S II 82). *Rebirth-linking* is the actual linking
with the next becoming, which "is perilous since it is not immune from
the suffering due to the signs of \[the impending\] rebirth-linking."
The quotation given is: "Bhikkhus, when there is consciousness as
nutriment there is greed (lust), there is delighting ..." (S II 102---
complete as above).

[]



[5.] One who wants to develop that perception of repulsiveness
in nutriment should learn the meditation subject and see that he has no
uncertainty about even a single word of what he has learnt. Then he
should go into solitary retreat and \[342\] review repulsiveness in ten
aspects in the physical nutriment classified as what is eaten, drunk,
chewed, and tasted, that is to say, as to going, seeking, using,
secretion, receptacle, what is uncooked (undigested), what is cooked
(digested), fruit, outflow, and smearing.



[6.] *1.* Herein, *as to going*: even when a man has gone forth
in so mighty a dispensation, still after he has perhaps spent all night
reciting the Enlightened One's word or doing the ascetic' s work, after
he has risen early to do the duties connected with the shrine terrace
and the Enlightenment-tree terrace, to set out the water for drinking
and washing, to sweep the grounds and to see to the needs of the body,
after he has sat down on his seat and given attention to his meditation
subject twenty or thirty times5 and got up again, then he must take his
bowl and \[outer\] robe, he must leave behind the ascetics' woods that
are not crowded with people, offer the bliss of seclusion, possess shade
and water, and are clean, cool, delightful places, he must disregard the
Noble Ones' delight in seclusion, and he must set out for the village in
order to get nutriment, as a jackal for the charnel ground.



[7.]And as he goes thus, from the time when he steps down from
his bed or chair he has to tread on a carpet6 covered with the dust of
his feet, geckos' droppings, and so on. Next he has to see the
doorstep,7 which is more repulsive than the inside of the room since it
is often fouled with the droppings of rats, bats,8 and so on. Next the
lower terrace, which is more repulsive than the terrace above since it
is all smeared with the droppings of owls, pigeons,9 and so on. Next the
grounds,10 which are more repulsive than the lower floor since they are
defiled by old grass and leaves blown about by the wind, by sick
novices' urine, excrement, spittle and snot, and in the rainy season by
water, mud, and so on. And he has to see the road to the monastery,
which is more repulsive than the grounds.



5\. "'*Twenty or thirty times'*: here some say that the definition of
the number of times is according to what is present-by-continuity (see
XIV.188). But others say that it is by way of "warming up the seat" (see
M-a I 255); for development that has not reached suppression of
hindrances does not remove the bodily discomfort in the act of sitting,
because of the lack of pervading happiness. So there is inconstancy of
posture too. Then 'twenty or thirty' is taken as the number already
observed by the time of setting out on the alms round. Or alternatively,
from 'going' up to 'smearing' is one turn; then it is after giving
attention to the meditation subject by twenty or thirty turns in this
way" (Vism-mhṭ 339).\



6\. *Paccattharaṇa---"*carpet": the word normally means a coverlet, but
here, according to Vism-mhṭ, (p. 339) it is, "a spread *(attharaṇa) *
consisting of a rug *(cilimika) * to be spread on the ground for
protecting the skin."\



7\. For *pamukha---"*doorstep*,"* perhaps an open upper floor gallery
here, see XIII.6.



8\. *Jatukā---"*bat*"* = *khuddaka-vaggulī* (Vism-mhṭ 339): not in PED;
see XIII.97.



9\. *Pārāvata---"*pigeon*"*: only spelling *pārāpata* given in PED.



10\. For this meaning of *pariveṇa* see Ch. IV, note 37.

[8.]In due course, after standing in the debating lodge11 when
he has finished paying homage at the Enlightenment Tree and the shrine,
he sets out thinking, "Instead of looking at the shrine that is like a
cluster of pearls, and the Enlightenment Tree that is as lovely as a
bouquet of peacock's tail feathers, and the abode that is as fair as a
god's palace, I must now turn my back on such a charming place and go
abroad for the sake of food;" and on the way to the village, the view of
a road of stumps and thorns and an uneven road broken up by the force of
water awaits him.



[9.]Next, after he has put on his waist cloth as one who hides
an abscess, and tied his waist band as one who ties a bandage on a
wound, and robed himself in his upper robes as one who hides a skeleton,
and taken out his bowl as one who takes out a pan for medicine, \[343\]
when he reaches the vicinity of the village gate, perhaps the sight of
an elephant's carcass, a horse's carcass, a buffalo's carcass, a human
carcass, a snake's carcass, or a dog's carcass awaits him, and not only
that, but he has to suffer his nose to be assailed by the smell of them.



Next, as he stands in the village gateway, he must scan the village
streets in



order to avoid danger from savage elephants, horses, and so on.



[10.] So this repulsive \[experience\] beginning with the
carpet that has to be trodden on and ending with the various kinds of
carcasses that have to be seen and smelled, \[has to be undergone\] for
the sake of nutriment: "Oh, nutriment is indeed a repulsive thing!"



This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to going.



[11.]*2. * How  *as to seeking*? When he has endured the
repulsiveness of going in this way, and has gone into the village, and
is clothed in his cloak of patches, he has to wander in the village
streets from house to house like a beggar with a dish in his hand. And
in the rainy season wherever he treads his feet sink into water and mire
up to the flesh of the calves.12 He has to hold the bowl in one hand and
his robe up with the other. In the hot season he has to go about with
his body covered with the dirt, grass, and dust blown about by the wind.
On reaching such and such a house door he has to see and even to tread
in gutters and cesspools covered with blue-bottles and seething with all
the species of worms, all mixed up with fish washings, meat washings,
rice washings, spittle, snot, dogs' and pigs' excrement, and what not,
from which flies come up and settle on his outer cloak of patches and on
his bowl and on his head.



[12.]And when he enters a house, some give and some do not. And
when they give, some give yesterday's cooked rice and stale cakes and
rancid jelly, sauce and so on.13 Some, not giving, say, "Please pass on,
venerable sir," others keep



11\. *Vitakka-māḷaka---"*debating* * lodge": Vism-mhṭ (p. 339) says:
"'*Kattha nu kho ajja* *bhikkhāya caritabban' ti ādinā vitakkamāḷake"*
("in a lodge for thinking in the way beginning 'Where must I go for alms
today?'").\



12\. *Piṇḍika-maṃsa---"*flesh of the calves" *=*
*jaṅghapiṇḍikaṃamsapadesa.* (Vism-mhṭ 340) Cf. VIII.97; also A-a 417.
Not in this sense in PED.\



13\. *Kummāsa---"*jelly*"*: usually rendered "junket," but the Vinaya
commentaries give it as made of corn *(yava).*

silent as if they did not see him. Some avert their faces. Others treat
him with harsh words such as: "Go away, you bald-head." When he has
wandered for alms in the village in this way like a beggar, he has to
depart from it.



[13.]So this \[experience\] beginning with the entry into the
village and ending with the departure from it, which is repulsive owing
to the water, mud, etc., that has to be trodden in and seen and endured,
\[has to be undergone\] for the sake of nutriment: "Oh, nutriment is
indeed a repulsive thing!"



This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to seeking. \[344\]



[14.] *3.* How *as to using*? After he has sought the nutriment
in this way and is sitting at ease in a comfortable place outside the
village, then so long as he has not dipped his hand into it he would be
able to invite a respected bhikkhu or a decent person, if he saw one,
\[to share it\]; but as soon as he has dipped his hand into it out of
desire to eat he would be ashamed to say, "Take some." And when he has
dipped his hand in and is squeezing it up, the sweat trickling down his
five fingers wets any dry crisp food there may be and makes it sodden.



[15.]And when its good appearance has been spoilt by his
squeezing it up, and it has been made into a ball and put into his
mouth, then the lower teeth function as a mortar, the upper teeth as a
pestle, and the tongue as a hand. It gets pounded there with the pestle
of the teeth like a dog's dinner in a dog's trough, while he turns it
over and over with his tongue; then the thin spittle at the tip of the
tongue smears it, and the thick spittle behind the middle of the tongue
smears it, and the filth from the teeth in the parts where a tooth-stick
cannot reach smears it.



[16.] When thus mashed up and besmeared, this peculiar compound
now destitute of the \[original\] colour and smell is reduced to a
condition as utterly nauseating as a dog's vomit in a dog's trough. Yet,
notwithstanding that it is like this, it can still be swallowed because
it is no longer in range of the eye's focus.



This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to using.



[17.] How *as to secretion*? Buddhas and
Paccekabuddhas and Wheel-turning Monarchs have only one of the four
secretions consisting of bile, phlegm, pus and blood, but those with
weak merit have all four. So when \[the food\] has arrived at the stage
of being eaten and it enters inside, then in one whose secretion of bile
is in excess it becomes as utterly nauseating as if smeared with thick
*madhuka* oil; in one whose secretion of phlegm in excess it is as if
smeared with the juice of *nāgabalā* leaves;14 in one whose secretion of
pus is in excess it is as if smeared with rancid buttermilk; and in one
whose secretion of blood is in excess it is as utterly nauseating as if
smeared with dye. This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to
secretion.



18\.



*5.* How *as to receptacle*? When it has gone inside the belly and is
smeared with one of these secretions, then the receptacle it goes into
is no gold dish or crystal or silver dish and so on. On the contrary, if
it is swallowed by one ten years old, it finds itself in a place like a
cesspit unwashed for ten years. \[345\] If it is swallowed by one twenty
years old, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety



14\. *Nāgabalā---*a kind of plant; not in PED.



[]



[]



years old, if it is swallowed by one a hundred years old, it finds
itself in a place like a cesspit unwashed for a hundred years. This is
how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to receptacle.



[19.] *6.* How *as to what is uncooked* (*undigested*)? After
this nutriment has arrived at such a place for its receptacle, then for
as long as it remains uncooked it stays in that same place just
described, which is shrouded in absolute darkness, pervaded by
draughts,15 tainted by various smells of ordure and utterly fetid and
loathsome. And just as when a cloud out of season has rained during a
drought and bits of grass and leaves and rushes and the carcasses of
snakes, dogs and human beings that have collected in a pit at the gate
of an outcaste village remain there warmed by the sun's heat until the
pit becomes covered with froth and bubbles, so too, what has been
swallowed that day and yesterday and the day before remains there
together, and being smothered by the layer of phlegm and covered with
froth and bubbles produced by digestion through being fermented by the
heat of the bodily fires, it becomes quite loathsome. This is how
repulsiveness should be reviewed as to what is uncooked.



[20.] *7.* How *as to what is cooked*? When it has been
completely cooked there by the bodily fires, it does not turn into gold,
silver, etc., as the ores16 of gold, silver, etc., do \[through
smelting\]. Instead, giving off froth and bubbles, it turns into
excrement and fills the receptacle for digested food, like brown clay
squeezed with a smoothing trowel and packed into a tube, and it turns
into urine and fills the bladder. This is how repulsiveness should be
reviewed as to what is cooked.



[21.] *8.* How *as to fruit*? When it has been rightly cooked,
it produces the various kinds of ordure consisting of head hairs, body
hairs, nails, teeth, and the rest. When wrongly cooked it produces the
hundred diseases beginning with itch, ring-worm, smallpox, leprosy,
plague, consumption, coughs, flux, and so on. Such is its fruit. This is
how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to fruit.



[22.]9. How *as to outflow*? On being swallowed, it enters by
one door, after which it flows out by several doors in the way
beginning, "Eye-dirt from the eye, ear- dirt from the ear" (Sn 197). And
on being swallowed it is swallowed even in the company of large
gatherings. But on flowing out, now converted into excrement, urine,
etc., it is excreted only in solitude. \[346\] On the first day one is
delighted to eat it, elated and full of happiness and joy. On the second
day one stops one's nose to void it, with a wry face, disgusted and
dismayed. And on the first day one swallows it lustfully, greedily,
gluttonously, infatuatedly. But on the second day, after a single night
has passed, one excretes it with distaste, ashamed, humiliated and
disgusted. Hence the Ancients said:



[23.] The food and drink so greatly prized--- The crisp to
chew, the soft to suck---\
Go in all by a single door,\
But by nine doors come oozing out.



15\. *Pavana---*"draught": not in this sense in PED; see XVI.37.



16\. *Dhātu---"*ore*"*: not in this sense in PED. See also XV.20.



[]



[]



The food and drink so greatly prized---\
The crisp to chew, the soft to suck---\
Men like to eat in company,\
But to excrete in secrecy.



The food and drink so greatly prized---\
The crisp to chew, the soft to suck---\
These a man eats with high delight,\
And then excretes with dumb disgust.



The food and drink so greatly prized---\
The crisp to chew, the soft to suck---\
A single night will be enough\
To bring them to putridity.



This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to outflow.



[24.] How *as to smearing*? At the time of using
it he smears his hands, lips, tongue and palate, and they become
repulsive by being smeared with it. And even when washed, they have to
be washed again and again in order to remove the smell. And, just as,
when rice is being boiled, the husks, the red powder covering the grain,
etc., rise up and smear the mouth, rim and lid of the cauldron, so too,
when eaten it rises up during its cooking and simmering by the bodily
fire that pervades the whole body, it turns into tartar, which smears
the teeth, and it turns into spittle, phlegm, etc., which respectively
smear the tongue, palate, etc.; and it turns into eye-dirt, ear-dirt,
snot, urine, excrement, etc., which respectively smear the eyes, ears,
nose and nether passages. And when these doors are smeared by it, they
never become either clean or pleasing even though washed every day. And
after one has washed a certain one of these, the hand has to be washed
again.17 And after one has washed a certain one of these, the
repulsiveness does not depart from it even after two or three washings
with cow dung and clay and scented powder. This is how repulsiveness
should be reviewed as to smearing.



[25.]As he reviews repulsiveness in this way in ten aspects and
strikes at it with thought and applied thought, physical nutriment
\[347\] becomes evident to him in its repulsive aspect. He cultivates
that sign18 again and again, develops and



17\. "'*A certain one'* is said with reference to the anal orifice. But
those who are scrupulously clean by nature wash their hands again after
washing the mouth, and so on" (Vism-mhṭ 342).\



18\. "'*That sign*': that object as the sign for development, which sign
is called *physical nutriment* and has appeared in the repulsive aspect
to one who gives his attention to it repeatedly in the ways already
described. And there, while development occurs through the repulsive
aspect, it is only the dhammas on account of which there comes to be the
concept of physical nutriment that are repulsive, not the concept. But
it is because the occurrence of development is contingent only upon
dhammas with an individual essence, and because the profundity is due to
that actual individual essence of dhammas that have individual essences,
that the jhāna cannot reach absorption in it through apprehension of the
repulsive aspect. For it is owing to profundity that the first pair of
truths is hard to see" (Vism-mhṭ 342--43).



[]



[]



repeatedly practices it. As he does so, the hindrances are suppressed,
and his mind is concentrated in access concentration, but without
reaching absorption because of the profundity of physical nutriment as a
state with an individual essence. But perception is evident here in the
apprehension of the repulsive aspect, which is why this meditation
subject goes by the name of "perception of repulsiveness in nutriment."



[26.] When a bhikkhu devotes himself to this perception of
repulsiveness in nutriment, his mind retreats, retracts and recoils from
craving for flavours. He nourishes himself with nutriment without vanity
and only for the purpose of crossing over suffering, as one who seeks to
cross over the desert eats his own dead child's flesh (S II 98). Then
his greed for the five cords of sense desire comes to be fully
understood without difficulty by means of the full understanding of the
physical nutriment. He fully understands the materiality aggregate by
means of the full-understanding of the five cords of sense desire.
Development of mindfulness occupied with the body comes to perfection in
him through the repulsiveness of "what is uncooked" and the rest. He has
entered upon a way that is in conformity with the perception of
foulness. And by keeping to this way, even if he does not experience the
deathless goal in this life, he is at least bound for a happy destiny.



This is the detailed explanation of the development of the perception of



repulsiveness in nutriment.



\[DEFINING OF THE ELEMENTS: WORD DEFINITIONS\]



[27.]Now comes the description of the development of the
definition of the four elements, which was listed as the "one defining"
next to the perception of repulsiveness in nutriment (III.105).



Herein, "defining" (*vavatthāna*) is determining by characterizing
individual essences.19 \[The compound\] *catudhātuvavatthāna*
("four-element defining") is \[resolvable into\] *catunnaṃ dhātūnaṃ
vavatthānaṃ* ("defining of the four elements"). "Attention given to
elements," "the meditation subject consisting of elements" and "defining
of the four elements" all mean the same thing.



This is given in two ways: in brief and in detail. It is given in brief
in the Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna Sutta (D II 294), and in detail in the
Mahāhatthipadopama Sutta (M I 185), the Rāhulovāda Sutta (M I 421), and
the Dhātuvibhaṅga Sutta (M III 240).



19\. "'*By characterizing individual essences*': by making certain
*(upadhāraṇa)* of the specific characteristics of hardness, and so on.
For this meditation subject does not consist in the observing of a mere
concept, as in the case of the earth kasiṇa as a meditation subject,
neither does it consist in the observing of the colour blue, etc., as in
the case of the blue kasiṇa as a meditation subject, nor in the
observing of the general characteristics of impermanence, etc., in
formations, as in the case of insight as a meditation subject; but
rather it consists in the observing of the individual essences of earth,
and so on. That is why 'by characterizing individual essences' is said,
which means, 'by making certain of the specific characteristics of
hardness, and so on"(Vism- mhṭ 344).



[]



[]



\[TEXTS AND COMMENTARY IN BRIEF\]



[28.] It is given in brief in the Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna Sutta, for
one of quick understanding whose meditation subject is elements, as
follows: "Bhikkhus, just as though a skilled butcher or butcher's
apprentice had killed a cow and were seated at the crossroads \[348\]
with it cut up into pieces, so too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu reviews this
body however placed, however disposed, as consisting of elements: In
this body there are the earth element, the water element, the fire
element, and the air element" 20 (D II 294).



[29.] The meaning is this: *just as though a clever butcher*,
or his *apprentice * who worked for his keep, *had killed a cow* and
divided it up *and were seated at the crossroads*, reckoned as the
intersection of the main roads going in the four directions, having laid
it out part by part, *so too a bhikkhu reviews the body, however placed*
because it is in some one of the four postures and *however disposed*
because it is so placed, thus: *In this body there are the earth
element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element*.



[30.]What is meant? Just as the butcher, while feeding the cow,
bringing it to the shambles, keeping it tied up after bringing it there,
slaughtering it, and seeing it slaughtered and dead, does not lose the
perception "cow" so long as he has not carved it up and divided it into
parts; but when he has divided it up and is sitting there, he loses the
perception "cow" and the perception "meat" occurs; he does not think "I
am selling cow" or "They are carrying cow away," but rather he thinks "I
am selling meat" or "They are carrying meat away"; so too this bhikkhu,
while still a foolish ordinary person---both formerly as a layman and as
one gone forth into homelessness---does not lose the perception "living
being" or "man" or "person" so long as he does not, by resolution of the
compact into elements, review this body, however placed, however
disposed, as consisting of elements. But when he does review it as
consisting of elements, he loses the perception "living being" and his
mind establishes itself upon elements. That is why the Blessed One said:
"Bhikkhus, just as though a skilled butcher *...* were seated at the
crossroads *...* so too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu *...* air element."



20\. "Herein, as regards *'earth element,'* etc., the meaning of element
is the meaning of individual essence, the meaning of individual essence
is the meaning of voidness, the meaning of voidness is the meaning of
not-a-living-being. So it is just earth in the sense of individual
essence, voidness and not-a-living-being that is the element; hence it
is earth element; so too in the case of the water element, and the rest.
The earth element is the element that is the foothold for the conascent
material states. Likewise the water element is the element of their
cohesion; the fire element is the element of their ripening; and the air
element is the element of their conveyance and distension" (Vism-mhṭ
345).\
To avoid confusion, it might be mentioned here that in "physical" earth,
fire, water, and air, it would be held that all four elements are
present in each equally, but that in "physical" earth the earth element
is dominant in efficacy as the mode of hardness; and correspondingly
with water and the rest. See e.g. XIV.45.

\[IN DETAIL\]



31\.



In the Mahāhatthipadopama Sutta it is given in detail for one of not
over- quick understanding whose meditation subject is elements---and as
here so also in the Rāhulovāda and Dhātuvibhaṅga Suttas---as follows:



"And what is the internal earth element, friends? Whatever there is
internally in oneself that is hard, harsh,21 and clung to (acquired
through kamma), that is to say, head hairs, body hairs, teeth, nails,
skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidney, heart, liver, midriff,
spleen, lungs, bowels, entrails, gorge, dung, or whatever else there is
internally in oneself that is hard, harsh, and clung to--- this is
called the internal earth element" (M I 185). \[349\]



And: "What is the internal water element, friends? Whatever there is
internally in oneself that is water, watery, and clung to, that is to
say, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, spittle, snot,
oil of the joints, and urine, or whatever else there is internally in
oneself that is water, watery, and clung to---this is called the
internal water element" (M I 187).



And: "What is the internal fire element, friends? Whatever there is
internally in oneself that is fire, fiery, and clung to, that is to say,
that whereby one is warmed, ages, and burns up, and whereby what is
eaten, drunk, chewed and tasted gets completely digested, or whatever
else there is internally in oneself that is fire, fiery, and clung
to---this is called the internal fire element" (M I 188).



And: "What is the internal air element, friends? Whatever there is
internally in oneself that is air, airy, and clung to, that is to say,
up-going winds, down- going winds, winds in the belly, winds in the
bowels, winds that course through all the limbs, in-breath and
out-breath, or whatever else there is internally in oneself that is air,
airy, and clung to---this is called the internal air element" (M I 188).



[32.]Here is the commentary on the words that are not clear.
*Internally in oneself* (*ajjhattaṃ paccattaṃ*): both these words are
terms for what is one's own (*niyaka*), since what is one's own is what
is produced in one's own self (*attani jātaṃ*); the meaning is, included
in one's continuity (*sasantati-pariyāpanna*). This is called "internal"
(*ajjhanaṃ * =  *adhi * +  *attā*, lit. "belonging-to-self") because it
occurs in self (*attani---\
*locative case) just as in the world, speech among women
(*itthīsu---*loc. case) is called "\[speech\] belonging-to-women"
(*adhitthi*). And it is called, "in oneself" (*paccattaṃ*) because it
occurs owing to self (*attānaṃ paṭicca*).22



[33.]*Hard*: rigid. *Harsh*: rough. Herein, the first is a word
for the characteristic, while the second is a word for the mode; for the
earth element is characterized as hard, but its mode is rough, which is
why it is called "harsh." *Clung to*: taken firmly \[by kamma\]; the
meaning is, firmly taken, seized, adhered to, as "I," "mine" (see
§89f.).



[34.]*That is to say*: the word *seyyathidaṃ* ("that is to
say") is a particle; its meaning is, "What is that?" Next, showing what
that is, "head hairs, body hairs," etc., is



21\. *Kharigata---*"harsh": not in PED, but see *khara.* 22. "What
occurs in attendance *(adhikicca) * upon self *(attā) * by its
pertaining to the state that may be taken as self because it is included
in one's own continuity as internal *(ajjhatta)"* (Vism-mhṭ 347).

said. And here the *brain * must be added since it has to be understood
that the earth element needs to be described in twenty modes. Or
*whatever else*: the earth element included in the remaining three
portions.



[35.]\[350\] It flows (*appoti*), flows on (*pappoti*), to such
and such a place as a state of streaming, thus it is water (*āpo*). The
*watery * (*āpo-gata*) is what is gone (*gata*) among such various kinds
of water (*āpo*) as the kamma-originated, and so on. What is that? It is
what has the water element's characteristic of cohesion.



[36.] *Fire * (*tejo*) \[is definable\] as heating (*tejana*).
The *fiery * (*tejo-gata*) is what is gone (*gata*), in the way already
described, among the kinds of fire (*tejo*). What is that? It is what
has the characteristic of heat. *Whereby*: by means of which the fire
element, when excited, this body is *warmed*, becomes heated by the
state of one- day fever,23 and so on. *Ages*: whereby this body grows
old, reaches the decline of the faculties, loss of strength, wrinkles,
grayness, and so on. *Burns up*: whereby, when excited, it causes this
body to burn, and the person cries out, "I am burning, I am burning!"
and longs for ghee a hundred times washed and for *gosīsa* sandalwood
ointment, etc., and for the breeze of a fan. *And whereby what is
eaten*, *drunk, chewed and tasted gets completely digested*: whereby the
boiled rice, etc., that is eaten, or the beverage, etc., that is drunk,
or the hard food consisting of flour biscuits, etc., that is chewed, the
mango fruit, honey, molasses, etc., that is tasted, gets completely
cooked; gets its juice, etc., extracted, is the meaning. And here the
first three kinds of fire element \[that is to say, "is warmed," "ages,"
and "burns up"\] are of fourfold origination (XX.27ff.), while the last
is only kamma-originated.



[37.]*Air * (*vāyo*) \[is definable\] as blowing (*vāyana*).
The *airy * (*vāyo-gata*) is what is gone (*gata*), in the way already
described, among the kinds of air. What is that? It is what has the
characteristic of distension.24  *Upgoing winds*: winds (forces)
mounting upwards that cause the occurrence of vomiting, belching, and so
on. *Down-going winds*: winds (forces) descending downwards that expel
excrement and urine. *Winds in the belly*: winds (forces) outside the
bowels. *Winds in the bowels*: winds (forces) inside the bowels. *Winds
that course through all the limbs*: winds (forces) that produce flexing,
extending, etc., and are distributed over the limbs and the whole body
by means of the network of veins (nerves). *In-breath*: wind in the
nostrils entering in. *Out-breath*: wind in the nostrils issuing out.
And here the first five are of fourfold origination. In-breath and
out-breath are consciousness-originated. \[351\]



23\. *Jara---"fever"*: not in PED; see A V 100; Nidd I 17.



24\. *Vitthambhana---*"distension": the word most usually employed to
describe the air element. It is often rendered by "supporting," a word
earmarked here for *nissaya.* The twofold function of the air element is
(a) to uphold *(sandhārana) * by distending *(vitthambhana)* and
preventing collapse (§92), and (b) to move *(samudīraṇa),* or more
strictly, cause the appearance of motion *(calana,* see n. 37). In
XIV.61 it is said to cause *thambhana,* rendered by "stiffening"; but
there is the description of the earth element as *thaddha* (e.g. §39;
pp. of *thambhati,* from which the noun *thambhana* comes), rendered by
"stiffenedness." It may also be noted that the word *sandhāraṇa*
(upholding) is used to describe both the earth element (XIV.47) and the
air element (XIV.61).

element, the fire element, or the air element included in the other
three portions.



[38.]So the four elements have been detailed in forty-two
aspects, that is to say, the earth element in twenty aspects, the water
element in twelve, the fire element in four, and the air element in six.



This, firstly, is the commentary on the texts here.



\[METHOD OF DEVELOPMENT  IN BRIEF\]



[39.]As regards the method of development here, however, to
discern the elements in detail in this way, "The head hairs are the
earth element, the body hairs are the earth element," appears redundant
to a bhikkhu of quick understanding, though the meditation subject
becomes clear to him if he gives his attention to it in this way: "What
has the characteristic of stiffenedness is the earth element, what has
the characteristic of cohesion is the water element, what has the
characteristic of ripening (maturing) is the fire element, what has the
characteristic of distending (supporting) is the air element." But when
one of not over-quick understanding gives his attention to it in this
way, it appears obscure and unevident, and it only becomes plain to him
if he gives his attention to it in the first-mentioned way. Why?



[40.]Suppose two bhikkhus are reciting a text with many elided
repetitions, then the bhikkhu with the quicker understanding fills out
the elided repetitions once or twice, after which he goes on doing the
recital with only the two end parts of the elisions. Here the one of
less quick understanding says, "What is he reciting? Why, he does not
even give one time to move one's lips! If the recitation is done like
this, when shall we ever get familiar with the text?" and so he does his
recitation filling out each elision as it comes. Then the other says,
"What is he reciting? Why, he never lets one get to the end of it! If
the recitation is done like this; when shall we ever get to the end of
it?" So too, the detailed discerning of the elements by head hairs,
etc., appears redundant to one of quick understanding, though the
meditation subject becomes clear to him if he gives his attention to it
in brief in this way, "What has the characteristic of stiffenedness is
the earth element," and so on. But when the other gives his attention to
it in this way, it appears obscure and unevident, and it only becomes
plain to him if he gives his attention in detail by head hairs and so
on.



[41.]So firstly, one of quick understanding who wants to
develop this meditation subject should go into solitary retreat. Then he
should advert to his own entire material body and discern the elements
in brief in this way: "In this body what is stiffenedness or harshness
is the earth element, what is cohesion or fluidity25 \[352\] is the
water element, what is maturing (ripening) or heat is the fire element,
what is distension or movement is the air element." And he should advert
and give attention to it and review it again and again as "earth
element, water element," that is to say, as mere elements, not a living
being, and soulless.



[42.]As he makes effort in this way it is not long before
concentration arises in him, which is reinforced by understanding that
illuminates the classification of



25\. *Drava-bhāva---*"fluidity": not in PED.

[]



the elements, and which is only access and does not reach absorption
because it has states with individual essences as its object.



[43.]Or alternatively, there are these four \[bodily\] parts
mentioned by the General of the Dhamma \[the Elder Sāriputta\] for the
purpose of showing the absence of any living being in the four great
primary elements thus: "When a space is enclosed with bones and sinews
and flesh and skin, there comes to be the term 'material form' (*rūpa*)"
(M I 190). And he should resolve each of these \[as a separate entity\],
separating them out by the hand of knowledge, and then discern them in
the way already stated thus: "In these what is stiffenedness or
harshness is the earth element." And he should again and again advert to
them, give attention to them and review them as mere elements, not a
living being, not a soul.



[44.]As he makes effort in this way, it is not long before
concentration arises in him, which is reinforced by understanding that
illuminates the classification of the elements, and which is only access
and does not reach absorption because it has states with individual
essences as its object.



This is the method of development when the definition of the elements is



given in brief.



\[METHOD  OF  DEVELOPMENT  IN  DETAIL\]



[45.]The method given in detail should be understood in this
way. A meditator of not over-quick understanding who wants to develop
this meditation subject should learn the elements in detail in the
forty-two aspects from a teacher, and he should live in an abode of the
kind already described. Then, when he has done all the duties, he should
go into solitary retreat and develop the meditation subject in four ways
thus: (1) with constituents in brief, (2) with constituents by analysis,
(3) with characteristics in brief, and (4) with characteristics by
analysis.



\[(1) WITH CONSTITUENTS IN BRIEF\]



[46.]Herein, how does he develop it *with constituents in
brief*? Here a bhikkhu does his defining in this way, "In twenty of the
parts what has the stiffened mode is the earth element," and he does his
defining thus, "In twelve parts the liquid called water with the mode of
cohesion is the water element," \[353\] and he does his defining thus,
"In four parts what matures (what has the mode of ripening) is the fire
element," and he does his defining thus, "In six parts what has the mode
of distending is the air element." As he defines them in this way they
become evident to him. As he again and again adverts to them and gives
his attention to them, concentration arises as access only.



\[(2) WITH  CONSTITUENTS BY  ANALYSIS\]



[47.]However, if his meditation subject is not successful while
he develops it in this way, then he should develop it *with constituents
by analysis*. How? Firstly, the bhikkhu should carry out all the
directions given for the thirty-two-fold aspect in the description of
mindfulness occupied with the body as a meditation subject
(VIII.48--78), namely, the sevenfold skill in learning and the tenfold
skill in giving

attention, and he should start with the verbal recitation, in direct and
reverse order, of the skin pentad and so on, without omitting any of it.
The only difference is this: there, after giving attention to the head
hairs, etc., as to colour, shape, direction, location, and delimitation,
the mind had to be fixed by means of repulsiveness (VIII.83), but here
it is done by means of elements. Therefore at the end of each part after
giving attention to head hairs, etc., each in the five ways beginning
with colour (VIII.83), attention should be given as follows.



[48.] These things called *head hairs* grow on the inner skin
that envelops the skull. Herein, just as when *kuṇṭha* grasses grow on
the top of an anthill, the top of the termite-mound does not know,
"*Kuṇṭha* grasses are growing on me," nor do the *kuṇṭha* grasses know,
"We are growing on the top of a termite-mound," so too, the inner skin
that covers the skull does not know, "Head hairs grow on me," nor do the
head hairs know, "We grow on inner skin that envelops a skull." These
things are devoid of mutual concern and reviewing. So what are called
*head hairs* are a particular component of this body, without thought,
\[morally\] indeterminate, void, not a living being, rigid (stiffened)
earth element.



[49.]*Body hairs* grow on the inner skin that envelops the
body. Herein, just as, when  *dabba * grasses grow on the square in an
empty village, the square in the empty village does not know*, "Dabba*
grasses grow on me," nor do the *dabba* grasses know, "We grow on the
square in an empty village," so too, the inner skin that envelops the
body does not know, "Body hairs grow on me," nor do the body hairs know,
"We grow on inner skin that envelops a body." These things are devoid of
mutual concern and reviewing. So what are called *body hairs* are a
particular component of this body, without thought, indeterminate, void,
not a living being, rigid earth element.



[50.]*Nails* grow on the tips of the fingers and toes. Herein,
just as, when children play a game by piercing *madhuka*-fruit kernels
with sticks, the sticks \[354\] do not know, *"Madhuka*-fruit kernels
are put on us," nor do the *madhuka*-fruit kernels know, "We are put on
sticks," so too, the fingers and toes do not know, "Nails grow on our
tips," nor do the nails know, "We grow on the tips of fingers and toes."
These things are devoid of mutual concern and reviewing. So what are
called  *nails* are a particular component of this body, without
thought, indeterminate, void, not a living being, rigid earth element.



[51.] *Teeth * grow in the jaw bones. Herein, just as, when
posts are placed by builders in stone sockets and fastened with some
kind of cement,26 the sockets do not know, "Posts are placed in us," nor
do the posts know, "We are placed in sockets," so too, the jaw bones do
not know, "Teeth grow in us," nor do the teeth know, "We grow in jaw
bones'." These things are devoid of mutual concern and reviewing. So
what are called *teeth* are a particular component of this body, without
thought, indeterminate, void, not a living being, rigid earth element.



[52.]*Skin* is to be found covering the whole body. Herein,
just as, when a big lute is covered with damp ox-hide, the lute does not
know, "I am covered with damp ox-hide," nor does the damp ox-hide know,
"A lute is covered by me," so too, the



26\. *Silesa---*"cement": not in this meaning in PED; M-a I 37
*saṃsilesa.*



[]



[]



body does not know, "I am covered by skin," nor does the skin know, "A
body is covered by me." These things are devoid of mutual concern and
reviewing. So what is called *skin* is a particular component of this
body, without thought, indeterminate, void, not a living being, rigid
earth element.



[53.]*Flesh* is to be found plastered over the framework of
bones. Herein, just as, when a wall is plastered with thick clay, the
wall does not know, "I am plastered with thick clay," nor does the thick
clay know, "A wall is plastered with me," so too, the framework of bones
does not know, "I am plastered with flesh consisting of nine hundred
pieces of flesh," nor does the flesh know, "A framework of bones is
plastered with me." These things are devoid of mutual concern and
reviewing. So what is called *flesh* is a particular component of this
body, without thought, indeterminate, void, not a living being, rigid
earth element.



[54.]*Sinews* are to be found in the interior of the body
binding the bones together. Herein, just as, when withies and sticks are
bound together with creepers, the withies and sticks do not know \[355\]
"We are bound together with creepers," nor do the creepers know,
"Withies and sticks are bound together by us," so too, the bones do not
know, "We are bound by sinews," nor do the sinews know, "Bones are bound
together by us." These things are devoid of mutual concern and
reviewing. So what are called *sinews* are a particular component of
this body, without thought, indeterminate, void, not a living being,
rigid earth element.



[55.]As to the *bones*, the heel bone is to be found holding up
the ankle bone, the ankle bone holding up the shin bone, the shin bone
the thigh bone, the thigh bone the hip bone, the hip bone the backbone,
the backbone the neck bone, and the neck bone is to be found holding up
the cranium bone. The cranium bone rests on the neck bone, the neck bone
on the backbone, the backbone on the hip bone, the hip bone on the thigh
bone, the thigh bone on the shin bone, the shin bone on the ankle bone,
the ankle bone on the heel bone.



[56.]Herein, just as, when bricks, timber or \[blocks of
dried\] cow dung are built up, those below do not know, "We each stand
holding up those above us," nor do those above know, "We each rest on
those below us," so too, the heel bone does not know, "I stand holding
up the ankle bone," nor does the ankle bone know, "I stand holding up
the shin bone," nor does the shin bone know, "I stand holding up the
thigh bone," nor does the thigh bone know, "I stand holding up the hip
bone," nor does the hip bone know, "I stand holding up the backbone,"
nor does the backbone know, "I stand holding up the neck bone," nor does
the neck bone know, "I stand holding up the cranium bone," nor does the
cranium bone know, "I rest on the neck bone," nor does the neck bone
know, "I rest on the backbone," nor does the backbone know, "I rest on
the hip bone," nor does the hip bone know, "I rest on the thigh bone,"
nor does the thigh bone know, "I rest on the shin bone," nor does the
shin bone know, "I rest on the ankle bone," nor does the ankle bone
know, "I rest on the heel bone." These things are devoid of mutual
concern and reviewing. So what are called *bones* \[356\] are a
particular component of this body, without thought, indeterminate, void,
not a living being, rigid earth element.



[]

[57.]*Bone marrow* is to be found inside the various bones.
Herein, just as, when boiled bamboo sprouts, etc., are put inside bamboo
joints, etc., the bamboo joints, etc., do not know, "Bamboo sprouts,
etc., are put in us," nor do the bamboo sprouts, etc., know, "We are
inside bamboo joints, etc.," so too, the bones do not know, "Marrow is
inside us," nor does the bone marrow know, "I am inside bones." These
things are devoid of mutual concern and reviewing. So what is called 
*bone marrow* is a particular component of this body, without thought,
indeterminate, void, not a living being, rigid earth element.



[58.]*Kidney* is to be found on each side of the heart flesh,
being fastened by the stout sinew that starts out with a single root
from the base of the neck and divides into two after going a short way.
Herein, just as, when a pair of mango fruits are bound together by their
stalk, the stalk does not know, "A pair of mango fruits is bound
together by me," nor do the pair of mango fruits know, "We are bound
together by a stalk," so too, the stout sinew does not know, "Kidneys
are bound together by me," nor does the kidney know, "I am bound
together by a stout sinew." These things are devoid of mutual concern
and reviewing. So what is called *kidney* is a particular component of
this body, without thought, indeterminate, void, not a living being,
rigid earth element.



[59.]*Heart* is to be found in the inside of the body near the
middle of the frame of the ribs. Herein, just as, when a piece of meat
is placed near the framework of an old cart, the inside of the framework
of the old cart does not know, "A piece of meat is placed near the
middle of me," nor does the piece of meat know, "I am near the middle of
the inside of the framework of an old cart," so too, the inside of the
framework of the ribs does not know, "A heart is near the middle of me,"
nor does the heart know, "I am near the middle of the inside of a
framework of ribs." These things are devoid of mutual concern and
reviewing. So what is called  *heart* is a particular component of this
body, without thought, indeterminate, void, not a living being, rigid
earth element.



[60.] *Liver * is to be found inside the body, near the right
side between the two breasts. Herein, just as, when a twin lump of meat
is stuck on the side of a cooking pot, the side of the cooking pot does
not know, "A twin lump of meat is stuck on me," nor does the twin lump
of meat know, \[357\] "I am stuck on the side of a cooking pot," so too,
the right side between the breasts does not know, "Liver is near me,"
nor does the liver know, "I am near a right side between two breasts."
These things are devoid of mutual concern and reviewing. So what is
called *liver* is a particular component of this body, without thought,
indeterminate, void, not a living being, rigid earth element.



[61.]As to the *midriff*, the concealed midriff is to be found
surrounding the heart and kidney, while the unconcealed midriff is to be
found covering the flesh under the skin in the whole body. Herein, just
as, when meat is wrapped in a rag, the meat does not know, "I am wrapped
in a rag," nor does the rag know, "Meat is wrapped in me," so too, the
heart and kidney, and the flesh in the whole body, do not know, "I am
concealed by midriff," nor does the midriff know, "Heart and kidney, and
flesh in a whole body, are concealed by me." These things are devoid of
mutual concern and reviewing. So what is called *midriff * is a
particular

component of this body, without thought, indeterminate, void, not a
living being, rigid earth element.



[62.]*Spleen* is to be found near the upper side of the belly
lining on the left side of the heart. Herein, just as, when a lump of
cow dung is near the upper side of a barn, the upper side of the barn

dung know, "I am near the upper side of a barn," so too, the upper side
of the belly lining does not know, "Spleen is near me," nor does the

is a particular component of this body, without thought, indeterminate,
void, not a living being, rigid earth element.



[63.]*Lungs* are to be found inside the body between the two
breasts, hanging over the heart and liver and concealing them. Herein,
just as when a bird's nest is hanging inside an old barn, the inside of
the old barn does not know, "A bird's nest is hanging in me," nor does
the bird's nest know, "I am hanging inside an old barn," so too, \[358\]
the inside of the body does not know, "Lungs are hanging in me," nor do
the lungs know, "We are hanging inside such a body." These things are
devoid of mutual concern and reviewing. So what is called *lungs* is a
particular component of this body, without thought, indeterminate, void,
not a living being, rigid earth element.



[64.]*Bowel* is to be found inside the body extending from the
base of the neck to the excrement passage. Herein, just as, when the
carcass of a large beheaded rat snake27 is coiled up and put into a
trough of blood, the red trough does not know, "A rat snake's carcass
has been put in me," nor does the rat snake's carcass know, "I am in a
red trough," so too, the inside of the body does not know, "A bowel is
in me," nor does the bowel know, "I am in a body." These things are
devoid of mutual concern and reviewing. So what is called the *bowel* is
a particular component of this body, without thought, indeterminate,

[65.]*Entrails* are to be found in the interspaces between the
twenty-one coils of the bowel, binding them together. Herein, just as,
when ropes are found sewing together a rope ring for wiping the feet,
the rope ring for wiping the feet does not know, "Ropes are to be found
sewing me together," nor do the ropes know, "We are to be found sewing
together a rope ring," so too, the bowel does not know, "Entrails are to
be found binding me together," nor do the entrails know, "We are to be

void, not a living being, rigid earth element.



[67.]*Dung* is to be found at the end of the bowel, which
resembles a bamboo joint eight fingerbreadths long and is called the
"receptacle for digested food." \[359\] Herein, just as, when soft brown
clay is impacted in a bamboo joint, the bamboo joint does not know,
"Brown clay is in me," nor does brown clay know, "I am in a bamboo
joint," so too, the receptacle for digested food does not know, "Dung is
in me," nor does the dung know, "I am in a receptacle for digested
food." These things are devoid of mutual concern and reviewing. So what
is called *dung* is a particular component of this body, without

reviewing. So what is called *brain* is a particular component of this
body, without thought, indeterminate, void, not a living being, rigid
earth element.



[69.]As to *bile*, the free bile, which is bound up with the
life faculty, is to be found soaking the whole body, while the local
bile is to be found in the bile container (gall-bladder). Herein, just
as, when oil has soaked a cake, the cake does not know, "Oil soaks me,"
nor does the oil know, "I soak a cake," so too, the body does not know,
"Free bile soaks me," nor does the free bile know, "I soak a body." And
just as, when a *kosāṭakī* (loofah) creeper bladder is filled with rain
water, the *kosāṭakī* creeper bladder does not know, "Rain water is in
me," nor does the rain water know, "I am in a *kosāṭakī* creeper
bladder," so too, the bile bladder does not know, "Local bile is in me,"

particular component of this body, without thought, indeterminate, void,
not a living being, liquid water element in the mode of cohesion.



[70.]*Phlegm* is to be found on the surface of the stomach and
measures a bowlful. Herein, just as, when a cesspool has a surface of
froth, the cesspool does not know, "A surface of froth is on me," nor

of mutual concern and reviewing. So what is called *phlegm* is a
particular component of this body, without thought, indeterminate, void,
not a living being, liquid water element in the mode of cohesion.



[71.] *Pus * has no fixed location. It is to be found wherever
the blood stagnates and goes bad in a part of the body damaged by wounds
caused by splinters and thorns, and by burns due to fire, or where
boils, carbuncles, etc., appear. Herein, just as, when a tree oozes gum
through being hit by, say, an axe, the parts of the



[]



[]



tree that have been hit do not know, "Gum is in us," nor does the gum
know, "I am in a part of a tree that has been hit," so too, the parts of
the body wounded by splinters, thorns, etc., do not know, "Pus is in

particular component of this body, without thought, indeterminate, void,
not a living being, liquid water element in the mode of cohesion.



[72.]As to *blood*, the mobile blood is to be found, like the
bile, soaking the whole body. The stored blood, is to be found filling
the lower part of the liver's site to the extent of a bowlful, wetting
the kidney, heart, liver and lungs. Herein, the definition of the mobile
blood is similar to that of the free bile. But as to the other, just as,
when rain water seeps through an old pot and wets clods and stumps
below, the clods and stumps do not know, "We are being wetted with
water," nor does the water know, "I am wetting clods and stumps," so
too, the lower part of the liver's site, or the kidneys, etc.,
respectively do not know, "Blood is in me," or "We are being wetted,"
nor does the blood know, "I fill the lower part of a liver's site, am
wetting a kidney, and so on." These things are devoid of mutual concern
and reviewing. So what is called *blood* is a particular component of
this body, without thought, indeterminate, void, not a living being,
liquid water element in the mode of cohesion.



[73.]*Sweat* is to be found filling the openings of the pores
of the head hairs and body hairs when there is heat due to fires, etc.,
and it trickles out of them. Herein, just as, when \[361\] bunches of
lily bud stems and lotus stalks are pulled up out of water, the openings
in the bunches of lilies, etc., do not know, "Water trickles from us,"
nor does the water trickling from the openings in the bunches of lilies,
etc., know, "I am trickling from openings in bunches of lilies, etc.,"
so too, the openings of the pores of the head hairs and body hairs do
not know, "Sweat trickles from us," nor does the sweat know, "I trickle
from openings of pores of head hairs and body hairs." These things are
devoid of mutual concern and reviewing. So what is called *sweat* is a
particular component of this body, without thought, indeterminate, void,
not a living being, liquid water element in the mode of cohesion.



[74.]*Fat* is the thick unguent to be found pervading the whole
body of one who is stout, and on the shank flesh, etc., of one who is
lean. Herein, just as, when a heap of meat is covered by a yellow rag,
the heap of meat does not know, "A yellow rag is next to me," nor does
the yellow rag know, "I am next to a heap of meat," so too, the flesh to
be found on the whole body, or on the shanks, etc., does not know, "Fat
is next to me," nor does the fat know,"I am next to flesh on a whole
body, or on the shanks, and so on." These things are devoid of mutual
concern and reviewing. So what is called *fat* is a particular component
of this body, without thought, indeterminate, void, not a living being,
thick-liquid water element in the mode of cohesion.



[75.]*Tears*, when produced, are to be found filling the eye
sockets or trickling out of them. Herein, just as, when the sockets of
young palm kernels are filled with water, the sockets of the young palm
kernels do not know, "Water is in us," nor

[]



does the water in the sockets of the young palm kernels know, "I am in
sockets of young palm kernels," so too, the eye sockets do not know,
"Tears are in us," nor do the tears know, "We are in eye sockets." These
things are devoid of mutual concern and reviewing. So what is called
*tears* is a particular component of this body, without thought,
indeterminate, void, not a living being, liquid water element in the
mode of cohesion.



[76.]*Grease* is the melted unguent to be found on the palms
and backs of the hands, on the soles and backs of the feet, on the nose
and forehead and on the points of the shoulders, when heated by fire,
and so on. Herein, just as, when rice gruel has oil put on it, the rice
gruel does not know, "Oil is spread over me," nor does the oil know, "I
am spread over rice gruel," so too, the place consisting of the palm of
the hand, etc., \[362\] does not know, "Grease is spread over me," nor
does the grease know, "I am spread over places consisting of the palm of
the hand, and so on." These things are devoid of mutual concern and
reviewing. So what is called *grease* is a particular component of this
body, without thought, indeterminate, void, not a living being, liquid
water element in the mode of cohesion.



[77.]*Spittle * is to be found on the surface of the tongue
after it has descended from the cheeks on both sides, when there is a
condition for the arising of spittle. Herein, just as, when a hollow in
a river bank is constantly oozing with water, the surface of the hollow
does not know, "Water lies on me," nor does the water know, "I lie on
the surface of a hollow," so too, the surface of the tongue does not
know, "Spittle that has descended from cheeks on both sides is on me,"
nor does the spittle know, "I have descended from cheeks on both sides
and am on the surface of a tongue." These things are devoid of mutual
concern and reviewing. So what is called *spittle* is a particular
component of this body, without thought, indeterminate, void, not a
living being, liquid water element in the mode of cohesion.



[78.]*Snot*, when produced, is to be found filling the nostrils
or trickling out of them. Herein, just as, when a bag28 is loaded with
rotting curd, the bag does not know, "Rotting curd is in me," nor does
the rotting curd know, "I am in a bag," so too, the nostrils do not
know, "Snot is in us," nor does the snot know, "I am in nostrils." These
things are devoid of mutual concern and reviewing. So what is called
*snot* is a particular component of this body, without thought,
indeterminate, void, not a living being, liquid water element in the
mode of cohesion.



[79.]*Oil of the joints* is to be found in the hundred and
eighty joints serving the function of lubricating the joints of the
bones. Herein, just as, when an axle is lubricated with oil, the axle
does not know, "Oil lubricates me," nor does the oil know, "I lubricate
an axle," so too, the hundred and eighty joints do not know, "Oil of the
joints lubricates us," nor does the oil of the joints know, "I lubricate
a hundred and eighty joints." These things are devoid of mutual concern
and reviewing. So what is called *oil of the joints* is a particular
component of this body, without thought, indeterminate, void, not a
living being, liquid water element in the mode of cohesion.



28\. *Sippikā---*"bag" (?): not in this sense in PED.

[80.]*Urine* is to be found inside the bladder. Herein, just
as, when a porous pot is put upside down in a cesspool, the porous pot
does not know, "Cesspool filtrate is in me," nor does the cesspool
filtrate know, "I am in a porous pot," so too, the bladder does not
know, \[363\] "Urine is in me," nor does the urine know, "I am in a
bladder." These things are devoid of mutual concern and reviewing. So
what is called *urine* is a particular component of this body, without
thought, indeterminate, void, not a living being, liquid water element
in the mode of cohesion.



[81.]When he has given his attention in this way to the body
hairs, etc., he should then give his attention to the \[four\] fire
components thus: *That whereby one is warmed---* this is a particular
component of this body, without thought, indeterminate, void, not a
living being; it is fire element in the mode of maturing (ripening).



That whereby one ages ...



That whereby one burns up ...



That whereby what is eaten, drunk, chewed and tasted becomes completely
digested---



this is a particular component of this body, without thought,
indeterminate, void, not a living being; it is fire element in the mode
of maturing (ripening).



[82.] After that, having discovered the *up-going winds*
(*forces*) as upgoing, the *down-going winds* (*forces*) as down-going,
the *winds * (*forces*)  *in the belly* as in the belly, the *winds*
(*forces*) *in the bowels* as in the bowels, the *winds* (*forces*)
*that course through all the limbs* as coursing through all the limbs,
and *in-breath and out- breath* as in-breath and out-breath, he should
give his attention to these \[six\] air components in this way: What is
called *up-going winds* (*forces*) is a particular component of this
body, without thought, indeterminate, void, not a living being; it is
air element in the mode of distending.



What is called *down-going winds (forces)* ...



What is called *winds (forces) in the belly* ...



What is called *winds (forces) in the bowels* ...



What is called *winds (forces) that course through all the limbs* ...



What is called *in-breath and out-breath* is a particular component of
this body, without thought, indeterminate, void, not a living being; it
is air element in the mode of distending.



[83.]As he gives his attention in this way the elements become
evident to him. As he adverts and gives attention to them again and
again access concentration arises in him in the way already described.



\[(3) WITH CHARACTERISTICS IN BRIEF\]



[84.]But if his meditation subject is still not successful when
he gives his attention to it in this way, then he should develop it
*with characteristics in brief*. How? In the *twenty components* the
characteristic of stiffenedness should be defined as the earth element,
and the characteristic of cohesion, which is there too, as the water
element, and the characteristic of maturing (ripening), which is there
too, as the fire element, and the characteristic of distension, which is
there too, as the air element. In the *twelve components* the
characteristic of cohesion should be defined as the water

element, the characteristic of maturing (ripening), which is there too,
as the fire element, the characteristic of distension, which is there
too, as the air element, and the characteristic of stiffenedness, which
is there too, as the earth element. In the *four components * the
characteristic of maturing (ripening) should be defined as the fire
element, the characteristic of distension unresolvable (inseparable)
from it as the air element, \[364\] the characteristic of stiffenedness
as the earth element, and the characteristic of cohesion as the water
element. In the *six components* the characteristic of distension should
be defined as the air element, the characteristic of stiffenedness there
too as the earth element, the characteristic of cohesion as the water
element, and the characteristic of maturing (ripening) as the fire
element.



As he defines them in this way the elements become evident to him. As he
adverts to them and gives attention to them again and again access
concentration arises in him in the way already stated.



\[(4) WITH CHARACTERISTICS BY ANALYSIS\]



[85.]However, if he still does not succeed with his meditation
subject when he gives his attention to it in this way, then he should
develop it *with characteristics by analysis*. How? After discerning
head hairs, etc., in the way already described, the characteristic of
stiffenedness in head hairs should be defined as the earth element, the
characteristic of cohesion there too as the water element, the
characteristic of maturing (ripening) as the fire element, and the
characteristic of distension as the air element. The four elements
should be defined in this way in the case of each component.



As he defines them in this way the elements become evident to him. As he
adverts and gives attention to them again and again access concentration
arises in him in the way already described.



\[ADDITIONAL WAYS OF GIVING ATTENTION\]



[86.]In addition, attention should be given to the elements in
the following ways: (1) as to word meaning, (2) by groups, (3) by
particles, (4) by characteristic, etc., (5) as to how originated, (6) as
to variety and unity, (7) as to resolution (separability) and
non-resolution (inseparability), (8) as to the similar and the
dissimilar, (9) as to distinction between internal and external, (10) as
to inclusion, (11) as to condition, (12) as to lack of conscious
reaction, (13) as to analysis of conditions.



[87.] *1.* Herein, one who gives his attention to them *as to
word meaning* should do so separately and generally thus: \[separately\]
it is earth (*pathavī*) because it is spread out (*patthaṭa*); it flows
(*appoti*) or it glides (*āpiyati*) or it satisfies (*appāyati*), thus
it is water (*āpo*); it heats (*tejati*), thus it is fire (*tejo*); it
blows (*vāyati*), thus it is air (*vāyo*). But without differentiation
they are elements (*dhātu*) because of bearing (*dhāraṇa*) their own
characteristics, because of grasping (*ādāna*) suffering, and because of
sorting out (*ādhāna*) suffering (see XV.19).29 This is how they should
be given attention as to word meaning.



29\. *"'Because of bearing their own characteristics'*: these are not
like the Primordial Essence  *(pakati---Skr. prakºti)* and the self
*(attā) * imagined by the theorists which are



[]



[]



[88.] *2.* *By groups*: there is the earth element described
under the twenty aspects (modes) beginning with head hairs, body hairs,
and also the water element described under the twelve (modes) aspects
beginning with bile, phlegm, etc. Now, as to these:



Colour, odour, taste, and nutritive\
Essence, and the four elements---\
From combination of these eight\
There comes the common usage head hairs;\
And separately from these eight30\
There is no common usage head hairs.



Consequently, head hairs are only a mere group of eight states.
Likewise, body hairs, \[365\] and the rest. A component here that is
kamma-originated is a group of ten states, \[that is to say, the former
eight\] together with the life faculty and sex. But it is on account of
respective prominence \[of stiffenedness or cohesion\] that it comes to
be styled "earth element" or "water element." This is how they should be
given attention to "by groups."



[89.] *3.* *By particles*: in this body the earth element taken
as reduced to fine dust and powdered to the size of the smallest atom31
might amount to an average *doṇa* measure full; and that is held
together32 by the water element measuring half as much. Being
maintained33 by the fire element, and distended by the air element, it
does not get scattered or dissipated. Instead of getting scattered or
dissipated, it arrives at the alternative states of the female and male
sex, etc., and manifests smallness, bigness, length, shortness,
toughness, rigidity, and so on.



non-existent as to individual essence. On the contrary, these do bear
their own characteristics, which is why they are elements" (Vism-mhṭ
359). Capitals have been used here and elsewhere though Indian alphabets
do not justify it. *Appāyati---"*to satisfy" is not in PED; see Vibh-a
9.\



30\. *"'From resolution of these eight'*: the eight dhammas beginning
with colour when resolved by means of understanding, are apprehendable
*(upalabbhanti)* in the ultimate sense through mutual negation
*(aññam-añña-vyatirekena); * but head hairs are not apprehendable in the
ultimate sense through negation of colour and so on. Consequently, the
term of common usage 'head hairs' is applied to these dhammas in their
co-arisen state; but if they are each taken separately, *'There is no
common-usage head hairs.'* The meaning is that it is a mere conventional
term. *'Only a mere group of eight states'* is said, taking the colour,
etc., which are real *(bhūta---lit.* 'become'), as a unity by means of
the concept *(paññatti) * 'a head hair,' not only because they are
merely the eight states" (Vism-mhṭ 360).\



31\. *Paramaṇu---*"the smallest atom"; see Vibh-a 343. According to
Vibh-a, the size of a  *paramaṇu* works out at 1/581,147,136th part of
an *aṅgula* (fingerbreadth or inch). Vism-mhṭ remarks (p. 361):
"Therefore ... a *paramaṇu* as a particle of space is not the province
of the physical eye, it is the province of the divine eye."



32\. *Saṅgahita---*"held* * together": not quite in this sense in PED.
"Held *(gahita) * by conjoining through cohesion and prevented from
being scattered" (Vism-mhṭ 361).



33\. "Kept guarded *(anurakkhita)* so that it may not lapse into a wet
and slippery state through the water element, which has trickling as its
essence" (Vism-mhṭ 361).



[]



[]



[90.] The liquid water element that is the mode of cohesion,
being founded on earth, maintained by fire, and distended by air, does
not trickle or run away.34 Instead of trickling or running away it
provides continued refreshments.35



[91.]And here the fire element that cooks what is eaten, drunk,
etc., and is the mode of warming and has the characteristic of heat,
being established on earth, held together by water, and distended by
air, maintains this body and ensures its proper appearance. And this
body, being maintained by it, shows no putrefaction.



[92.]The air element that courses through all the limbs and has
the characteristic of moving and distending, being founded upon earth,
held together by water, and maintained by fire, distends this body. And
this body, being distended by the latter kind of air, does not collapse,
but stands erect, and being propelled36 by the other \[motile\] air, it
shows intimation and it flexes and extends and it wriggles the hands and
feet, doing so in the postures comprising of walking, standing, sitting
and lying down. So this mechanism of elements carries on like a magic
trick, deceiving foolish people with the male and female sex and so on.



This is how they should be given attention by particles.



[93.] *4.* *As to characteristic, etc*.: he should advert to
the four elements in this way: "The earth element---what are its
characteristic, function, manifestation?" \[defining them in this way\]:
The earth element has the characteristic of hardness. Its function is to
act as a foundation. It is manifested as receiving. The water element
has the characteristic of trickling. Its function is to intensify. It is
manifested as holding together. The fire element has the characteristic
of heat. Its function is to mature (maintain). It is manifested as a
continued supply of softness. The air element has the characteristic of
distending. Its function is to cause motion. It is manifested as
conveying.37 This is how they should be given attention to by
characteristic, and so on. \[366\]



[94.] *5.*  *As to how originated*: among the forty-two
components beginning with head hairs shown in the detailed treatment of
the earth element, etc., the four consisting of gorge, dung, pus, and
urine are temperature-originated only; the four consisting of tears,
sweat, spittle, and snot are temperature-originated and
consciousness-originated only. The fire that cooks what is eaten, etc.,
is kamma- originated only; in-breath and out-breath are
consciousness-originated only; all



34\. *Parissavati---*"to run away": not in PED;---*vissarati* (Vism-mhṭ
361).



35\. "This is said with reference to the water element as a juice that
helps growth" (Vism-mhṭ 361).\



36\. *Samabbhāhata---*"propelled": see Ch. IV, note 38.\



37\. *Abhinīhāra---*"conveying": not in this sense in PED.
"*'Conveying'* is acting as cause for the successive arising at adjacent
locations *(desantaruppatti)* of the conglomeration of elements
*(bhūta-saṅghāta)" * (Vism-mhṭ 363). Elsewhere Vism-mhṭ (p. 359) says of
the air element: "'*It blows'* (§87): it is stirred; the meaning is that
the conglomeration of elements is made to move (go) by its action as
cause for successive arising at adjacent locations (points)," and
"Propelling *(samabbhāhana)* is the act of causing the successive
arising at adjacent locations of material groups *(rūpa-kalāpa)*" (p.
362).



[]

the rest are of fourfold origination. This is how they should be given
attention as to how originated.



[95.] *6.* *As to variety and unity*: there is variety in the
specific characteristics, etc., of all the elements; for the
characteristic, function, and manifestation of the earth element is one,
and those of the water element, etc., are different. But there is unity
in them as materiality, great primary, element, state (*dhamma*),
imperma- nence, etc., notwithstanding the fact that they are various
according to \[specific\] characteristic, etc., and according to
origination by kamma and so on.



[96.]All these elements are "instances of materiality"
(*rūpāni*) because they do not exceed the characteristic of "being
molested" (*ruppana*). They are "great primaries" (*mahābhūta*) by
reason of "great manifestation," and so on. "By reason of 'great
manifestation,' and so on" means that these elements are called "great
primaries" for the following reasons, namely: (a) manifestation of
greatness; (b) likeness to great creatures; (c) great maintenance; (d)
great alteration; and (e) because they are great and because they are
entities.



[97.]Herein, (a) *manifestation of greatness*: they are
manifested as great both in a continuity that is not clung to (acquired
through kamma) and in a continuity that is clung to. For their
manifestation of greatness in a continuity that is not clung to is given
in the description of the recollection of the Buddha in the way
beginning:



Two times a hundred thousand \[leagues\]\
And then four *nahutas* as well:\
This earth, this "bearer of all wealth,"\
Has that much thickness, as they tell (VII.41).



And they are manifested on a great scale also in a continuity that is
clung to, for instance, in the bodies of fishes, turtles, deities,
Dānava demons, and so on. For this is said: "Bhikkhus, there are
individual creatures of a hundred leagues in the great ocean" (A IV
207), and so on.



[98.](b) *Likeness to great creatures*: just as a magician
turns water that is not crystal into crystal, and turns a clod that is
not gold into gold, and shows them, and being himself neither a spirit
nor a bird, shows himself as a spirit or a bird, so too, being
themselves not blue-black, they turn themselves into blue-black derived
materiality, being themselves not yellow ... not red ... not white,
\[367\] they turn themselves into white derived materiality and show
that. In this way they are "great primaries" (*mahābhūta*) in being like
the great creatures (*mahābhūta*) of a magician.38



38\. "A great primary *(mahābhūta) * is a great wonder *(mahanto
abbhuto)* because it shows various unreal things *(abhūta),* various
wonders *(abbhuta),* and various marvels *(acchariya). * Or
alternatively: there are great wonders *(abbhuta) * here, thus there are
magicians. And spirits, etc., are huge *(mahant)* creatures *(bhūta)*
owing to being born from them, thus they are great primaries. Or
alternatively: this term 'great primary' can be regarded as a generic
term for all of them. But earth, etc., are great primaries because they
deceive, and because, like the huge creatures, their standing place
cannot be pointed to. The deception lies in causing the apparent
individual essences of



[]



[]



[99.] And just as, whomsoever the great creatures such as the
spirits (*yakkha*) grasp hold of (possess), they have no standing place
either inside him or outside him and yet they have no standing
independently of him, so too, these elements are not found to stand
either inside or outside each other yet they have no standing
independently of one another. Thus they are also great primaries
(*mahābhūta*) in being equal to the great creatures (*mahābhūta*) such
as the spirits because they have no thinkable standing place \[relative
to each other\].



[100.] And just as the great creatures known as female spirits
(*yakkhinī*) conceal their own fearfulness with a pleasing colour, shape
and gesture to deceive beings, so too, these elements conceal each their
own characteristic and function classed as hardness, etc., by means of a
pleasing skin colour of women's and men's bodies, etc., and pleasing
shapes of limbs and pleasing gestures of fingers, toes and eyebrows, and
they deceive simple people by concealing their own functions and
characteristics beginning with hardness and do not allow their
individual essences to be seen. Thus they are great primaries
(*mahābhūta*) in being equal to the great creatures (*mahābhūta*), the
female spirits, since they are deceivers.



[101.](c) *Great maintenance*: this is because they have to be
sustained by the great requisites. For these elements are great
primaries (*mahābhūta*) since they have become (*bhūta*), have occurred,
by means of the food, clothing, etc., which are great (*mahant*) \[in
importance\] because they have to be found every day. Or alternatively,
they are great primaries (*mahābhūta*) since they are primaries whose
maintenance is great.



[102.](d) *Great alteration*: the unclung-to and the clung-to
are the \[basis of\] great alterations. Herein, the great alteration of
the unclung-to evidences itself in the emergence of an aeon (see
XIII.34), and that of the clung-to in the disturbance of the elements
\[in the body\]. For accordingly:



The conflagration's flame bursts up\
Out of the ground and races higher\
And higher, right to the Brahmā heaven,\
When the world is burnt up by fire.



A whole world system measuring\
One hundred thousand millions wide\
Subsides, as with its furious waters\
The flood dissolves the world beside.



blue-black, etc., and it lies in causing the appearance of what has the
aspect of woman and man, and so on. Likewise their undemonstrability,
since they are not found inside or outside each other though they rely
upon each other for support. For if these elements were found inside
each other, they would not each perform their particular functions,
owing to mutual frustration. And if they were found outside each other,
they would be already resolved (separate), and that being so, any
description of them as unresolved (inseparable) would be meaningless. So
although their standing place is undemonstrable, still each one assists
the other by its particular function---the functions of establishing,
etc., whereby each becomes a condition for the others as conascence
condition and so on" (Vism-mhṭ 363).



[]



[]



One hundred thousand million leagues,\
A whole world system's broad extent\
Is rent and scattered, when the world\
Succumbs to the air element.



The bite of wooden-mouths can make\
The body stiff; to all intent,\
When roused is its earth element,\
It might be gripped by such a snake.



The bite of rotten-mouths can make\
The body rot; to all intent,\
When roused its water element,\
It might be gripped by such a snake. \[368\]



The bite of fiery-mouths can make\
The body burn; to all intent,\
When roused is its fire element,\
It might be gripped by such a snake.



The bite of dagger-mouths can make\
The body burst; to all intent,\
When roused is its air element,\
It might be gripped by such a snake.



So they are great primaries (*mahābhūta*) because they have become
(*bhūta*) \[the



basis of\] great (*mahant*) alteration.



[103.](e) *Because they are great and because they are
entities*: "great" (*mahant*) because they need great effort to discern
them, and "entities" (*bhūta* = become) because\
they are existent; thus they are great primaries (*mahābhūta*) because
they are great (*mahā*) and because they are entities (*bhūta*).



This is how all these elements are "great primaries" by reason of "great



manifestation," and so on.



[104.]Again, they are elements (*dhātu*) because of bearing
(*dhāraṇa*) their own characteristics, because of grasping (*ādāna*)
suffering, and because of sorting out (*ādhāna*) suffering (see XV.19),
and because none of them are exempt from the characteristic of being
elements.



They are states (*dhamma*) owing to bearing (*dhāraṇa*) their own
characteristics and owing to their so bearing (*dhāraṇa*) for the length
of the moment appropriate to them.39 They are impermanent in the sense
of \[liability to\] destruction; they are painful in the sense of
\[causing\] terror; they are not self in the sense of having no core
\[of permanence, and so on\]. Thus there is unity of all since all are
materiality, great primaries, elements, states, impermanent, and so on.



This is how they should be given attention "as to variety and unity."



[105.] *7. As to resolution* (*separability*)  *and
non-resolution* (*inseparability*): they are



positionally unresolvable (inseparable) since they always arise together
in every



39\. This alludes to the length of duration of a moment of matter's
existence, which is described as seventeen times as long as that of
consciousness (see Vibh-a 25f.).



[]



[]



single minimal material group consisting of the bare octad and the
others; but they are resolvable (separable) by characteristic. This is
how they should be given attention "as to resolution (separability) and
non-resolution (inseparability)."



[106.] *8.*  *As to the similar and dissimilar*: and although
they are unresolved (inseparable) in this way, yet the first two similar
in heaviness, and so are the last two in lightness; but \[for this
reason\] the first two are dissimilar to the last two and the last two
to the first two. This is how they should be given attention "as to the
similar and dissimilar."



[107.] *9.*  *As to distinction between internal and external*:
the internal elements are the \[material\] support for the physical
bases of consciousness, for the kinds of intimation, and for the
material faculties. They are associated with postures, and they are of
fourfold origination. The external elements are of the opposite kind.
This is how they should be given attention "as to distinction between
internal and external."



[108.] *10.*  *As to inclusion*: kamma-originated earth element
is included together with the other kamma-originated elements because
there is no difference in their origination. Likewise the
consciousness-originated is included together with other
consciousness-originated elements. This is how they should be given
attention "as to inclusion."



[109.] *11.*  *As to condition*: the earth element, which is
held together by water, maintained by fire and distended by air, is a
condition for the other three great primaries by acting as their
foundation. The water element, which is founded on earth, maintained by
fire and distended by air, is a condition for the other three great
primaries by acting as their cohesion. The fire element, which is
founded on earth, held together by water \[369\] and distended by air,
is a condition for the other three great primaries by acting as their
maintaining. The air element, which is founded on earth, held together
by water, and maintained by fire, is a condition for the other three
great primaries by acting as their distension. This is how they should
be given attention "as to condition."



[110.] *12.* *As to lack of conscious reaction*: here too the
earth element does not know, "I am the earth element" or "I am a
condition by acting as a foundation for three great primaries." And the
other three do not know, "The earth element is a condition for us by
acting as a foundation for three great primaries." And the other three
do not know, "The earth element is a condition for us by acting as our
foundation." And similarly in each instance. This is how they should be
given attention "as to lack of conscious reaction."



[111.] *13.* *As to analysis of conditions*: there are four
conditions for the elements,



that is to say, kamma, consciousness, nutriment, and temperature.



Herein,  *kamma* only is the condition for the kamma-originated
\[elements\]; *consciousness* (*citta*), etc. \[i.e. nutriment and
temperature\] are not. Consciousness, etc., only are the conditions for
the consciousness-originated \[elements\]; the others are not. *Kamma*
is the producing condition40 for the kamma-originated



40\. "The term *'producing condition'* refers to causing origination,
though as a condition it is actually kamma condition. For this is said:
'Profitable and unprofitable volition is

[]



elements; for the rest it is indirectly the decisive-supportive
condition.41 *Consciousness* is the producing condition for the
consciousness-originated elements; for the rest it is the post-nascence
condition, presence condition and non-disappearance condition.
*Nutriment* is the producing condition for the nutriment-originated
elements; for the rest it is the nutriment condition, presence condition
and non-disappearance condition. *Temperature* is the productive
condition for the temperature-originated elements; for the rest it is
the presence condition and non-disappearance condition.



Herein, the kamma-originated great primary is the condition for the
kamma- originated great primaries, and also for the
consciousness-originated \[great primaries\]. Likewise are the
consciousness-originated \[great primary\] and the nutriment originated
\[great primary\]. The temperature-originated great primary is the
condition for the temperature-originated great primaries, and also for
the kamma-originated \[great primaries\], and so on (cf. XX.27f.).



[112.] Herein, the kamma-originated earth element is a
condition for the other kamma-originated elements both as conascence,
mutuality, support, presence, and non-disappearance conditions and as
foundation, but not as producing condition. It is a condition for the
other \[three\] great primaries in a triple continuity (see XX.22) as
support, presence and non-disappearance conditions, but not as
foundation or producing condition. And here the water element is a
condition for the remaining three elements both as conascence, etc.,
conditions and as cohesion, but not as producing condition. And for the
others in a triple continuity it is a condition as support, presence,
and non-disappearance conditions too, but not as cohesion or producing
condition. And the fire element here is a condition for the other three
elements both as conascence, etc., conditions and as maintaining but not
as producing condition. And for the others in a triple continuity it is
a condition as support, presence, and non-disappearance conditions too,
but not as maintaining or producing condition. And the air element here
is a condition for the other three elements \[370\] both as conascence,
etc., conditions and as distension, but not as producing condition. And
for the others in a triple continuity it is a condition as support,
presence, and non- disappearance conditions too, but not as distension
or producing condition.



The same method applies in the case of the consciousness-originated, the
nutriment-originated, and the temperature-originated earth element, and
the rest. 113.



And when these elements have been made to occur through the influence



of the conascence, etc., conditions:



a condition, as kamma condition, for resultant aggregates and for
materiality due to kamma performed' (Paṭṭh I 5)" (Vism-mhṭ 368).\



41\. "'*For the rest'*: for consciousness-originated, and so on. It is
the indirectly decisive- support condition because in the Paṭṭhāna the
decisive-support condition has only been given for immaterial dhammas,
so there is, directly, no decisive-support condition \[in kamma\] for
material dhammas. However, because of the words, 'With a person as
decisive support' (M I 107) and 'With a grove as decisive support' (M I
106) in the Suttas, the decisive-support condition can be indirectly
understood according to the Suttas in the sense of 'absence without'"
(Vism-mhṭ 368).

With three in four ways to one due,\
And likewise with one due to three;\
With two in six ways due to two---\
Thus their occurrence comes to be.



[114.] Taking each one, beginning with earth, there are three
others whose occurrence is due to that one, thus with three due to one
their occurrence takes place in four ways. Likewise each one, beginning
with earth, occurs in dependence on the other three, thus with one due
to three their occurrence takes place in four ways. But with the last
two dependent on the first two, with the first two dependent on the last
two, with the second and fourth dependent on the first and third, with
the first and third dependent on the second and fourth, with the second
and third dependent on the first and fourth, and with the first and
fourth dependent on the second and third, they occur in six ways with
two elements due to two.



[115.] At the time of moving forward and moving backward (M I
57), the earth element among these is a condition for pressing. That,
seconded by the water element, is a condition for establishing on a
foundation. But the water element seconded by the earth element is a
condition for lowering down. The fire element seconded by the air
element is a condition for lifting up. The air element seconded by the
fire element is a condition for shifting forwards and shifting sideways
(see XX.62f. and M-a I 160).



This is how they should be given attention "as to analysis of
conditions."



[116.] As he gives his attention to them "as to word meaning,"
etc., in this way, the elements become evident to him under each
heading. As he again and again adverts and gives attention to them
access concentration arises in the way already described. And this
concentration too is called "definition of the four elements" because it
arises in one who defines the four elements owing to the influence of
his knowledge.



[117.] This bhikkhu who is devoted to the defining of the four
elements immerses himself in voidness and eliminates the perception of
living beings. Since he does not entertain false notions about wild
beasts, spirits, ogres, etc., because he has abolished the perception of
living beings, he conquers fear and dread and conquers delight and
aversion (boredom); he is not exhilarated or depressed42 by agreeable
and disagreeable things; and as one of great understanding, he either
ends in the deathless or he is bound for a happy destiny.



Defining the four elements\
Is ever the wise man's resort;\
The noble meditator lion43\
Will make this mighty theme his sport.



This is the description of the development of the defining of the four
elements. \[371\]

\[DEVELOPMENT  OF  CONCENTRATION---CONCLUSION\]



[118.]This completes in all its aspects the commentary on the
meaning of the clause, "How should it be developed?" in the set of
questions beginning with "What is concentration?" which was formulated
in order to show the method of development of concentration in detail
(see III.1).



[119.] This concentration as intended here is twofold, that is
to say, access concentration and absorption concentration. Herein, the
unification \[of mind\] in the case of ten meditation subjects and in
the consciousness preceding absorption \[in the case of the remaining
meditation subjects\]44 is access concentration. The unification of mind
in the case of the remaining meditation subjects is absorption
concentration. And so it is developed in two forms with the development
of these meditation subjects. Hence it was said above: "This completes
in all its aspects the commentary on the meaning of the clause, 'How
should it be developed?'"



\[THE BENEFITS OF DEVELOPING CONCENTRATION\]



[120.] The question, (viii) *what are the benefits of the
development of concentration?* was also asked, however (III.1). Herein,
the benefits of the development of concentration are fivefold, as a
blissful abiding here and now, and so on. For the development of
absorption concentration provides the benefit of a blissful abiding here
and now for the Arahants with cankers destroyed who develop
concentration, thinking, "We shall attain and dwell with unified mind
for a whole day." Hence the Blessed One said: "But, Cunda, it is not
these that are called effacement in the Noble Ones' discipline; these
are called blissful abidings in the Noble Ones' discipline" (M I 40).



[121.] When ordinary people and trainers develop it, thinking,
"After emerging, we shall exercise insight with concentrated
consciousness," the development of absorption concentration provides
them with the benefit of insight by serving as the proximate cause for
insight, and so too does access concentration as a method of arriving at
wide open \[conditions\] in crowded \[circumstances\].45 Hence the
Blessed One said: "Bhikkhus, develop concentration; a bhikkhu who is
concentrated understands correctly" (S III 13).



[122.] But when they have already produced the eight
attainments and then, aspiring to the kinds of direct-knowledge
described in the way beginning, "Having been one, he becomes many"
(XII.2), they produce them by entering upon jhāna as the basis for
direct-knowledge and emerging from it, then the development of
absorption concentration provides for them the benefit of the kinds of
direct-knowledge, since it becomes the proximate cause for the kinds of
direct-knowledge whenever there is an occasion. Hence the Blessed One
said:



44\. The sense demands reading with Vism-mhṭ *appanāpubba-bhāgacittesu*
as a single compound.\



45\. This is an allusion to M I 179, etc. "The process of existence in
the round of rebirths, which is a very cramped place, is crowded by the
defilements of craving and so on" (Vism-mhṭ 371).



[]



[]



"He attains the ability to be a witness, through realization by
direct-knowledge, of any state realizable by direct-knowledge to which
his mind inclines, whenever there is an occasion" (M III 96; A I 254).
\[372\]



[123.] When ordinary people have not lost their jhāna, and they
aspire to rebirth in the Brahmā-world thus, "Let us be reborn in the
Brahmā-world," or even though they do not make the actual aspiration,
then the development of absorption concentration provides them with the
benefits of an improved form of existence since it ensures that for
them. Hence the Blessed One said: "Where do they reappear after
developing the first jhāna limitedly? They reappear in the company of
the deities of Brahmā's Retinue" (Vibh 424), and so on. And even the
development of access concentration ensures an improved form of
existence in the happy destinies of the sensual sphere.



[124.] But when Noble Ones who have already produced the eight
attainments develop concentration, thinking, "We shall enter upon the
attainment of cessation, and by being without consciousness for seven
days we shall abide in bliss here and now by reaching the cessation that
is Nibbāna," then the development of absorption concentration provides
for them the benefit of cessation. Hence it is said: "Understanding as
mastery owing to ... sixteen kinds of behaviour of knowledge, and to
nine kinds of behaviour of concentration, is knowledge of the attainment
of cessation" (Paṭis I 97; see Ch. XXIII, 18f.).



[125.] That is how this benefit of the development of
concentration is fivefold as



a blissful abiding here and now, and so on.



So wise men fail not in devotion\
To the pursuit of concentration:\
It cleans defiling stains' pollution,46\
And brings rewards past calculation.



[126.] And at this point in the *Path of Purification*, which
is taught under the headings of virtue, concentration and understanding
in the stanza, "When a wise man, established well in virtue ...,"
concentration has been fully explained.

people.

## CHAPTER XII 


THE SUPERNORMAL POWERS



(*Iddhividha-niddesa*)



\[THE BENEFITS OF CONCENTRATION (CONTINUED)\]



[1.] \[373\] It was said above with reference to the mundane
kinds of direct- knowledge that this development of concentration
"provides ... the benefit of the kinds of direct-knowledge" (XI.122).
Now, in order to perfect those kinds of direct-knowledge the task must
be undertaken by a meditator who has reached the fourth jhāna in the
earth kasiṇa, and so on. And in doing this, not only will this
development of concentration have provided benefits in this way, it will
also have become more advanced; and when he thus possesses concentration
so developed as to have both provided benefits and become more advanced,
he will then more easily perfect the development of understanding. So
meanwhile we shall deal with the explanation of the kinds of
direct-knowledge now.



[2.]In order to show the benefits of developing concentration
to clansmen whose concentration has reached the fourth jhāna, and in
order to teach progressively refined Dhamma, five kinds of mundane
direct-knowledge have been described by the Blessed One. They are: (1)
the kinds of supernormal power, described in the way beginning, "When
his concentrated mind is thus purified, bright, unblemished, rid of
defilement, and has become malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to
imperturbability,1 he directs, he inclines, his mind to the kinds of
supernormal power. He wields the various kinds of supernormal power.
Having been one, he becomes many ..." (D I 77); (2) the knowledge of the
divine ear element; (3) the knowledge of penetration of minds; (4) the
knowledge of recollection of past lives; and (5) the knowledge of the
passing away and reappearance of beings.



\[(1) THE KINDS OF SUPERNORMAL POWER\]



If a meditator wants to begin performing the transformation by
supernormal power described as, "Having been one, he becomes many,"
etc., he must achieve the eight attainments in each of the eight kasiṇas
ending with the white kasiṇa. He must also have complete control of his
mind in the following fourteen ways: \[374\] (i) in the order of the
kasiṇa, (ii) in the reverse order of the kasiṇa, (iii) in the



1\. *Āneñja---*"imperturbability": a term normally used for the four
immaterial states, together with the fourth jhāna. See also §16f., and
MN 106.


[]



[]



order and reverse order of the kasiṇa, (iv) in the order of the jhāna,
(v) in the reverse order of the jhāna (vi) in the order and reverse
order of the jhāna, (vii) skipping jhāna, (viii) skipping kasiṇa, (ix)
skipping jhāna and kasiṇa, (x) transposition of factors, (xi)
transposition of object, (xii) transposition of factors and object,
(xiii) definition of factors, and (xiv) definition of object.



[3.] But what is "in the order of the kasiṇa" here? What is
"definition of object"?



[(i)] Here a bhikkhu attains jhāna in the earth kasiṇa, after
that in the water kasiṇa, and so progressing through the eight kasiṇas,
doing so even a hundred times, even a thousand times, in each one. This
is called *in the order of the kasiṇas*. (ii) Attaining them in like
manner in reverse order, starting with the white kasiṇa, is called *in
the reverse order of the kasiṇas*. (iii) Attaining them again and again
in forward and reverse order, from the earth kasiṇa up to the white
kasiṇa and from the white kasiṇa back to the earth kasiṇa, is called *in
the order and reverse order of the kasiṇas*.



[4.](iv) Attaining again and again from the first jhāna up to
the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception is called
*in the order of the jhānas.* (v) Attaining again and again from the
base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception back to the
first jhāna is called *in the reverse order of the jhānas*. (vi)
Attaining in forward and reverse order, from the first jhāna up to the
base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception and from the
base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception back to the
first jhāna, is called *in the order and reverse order of the jhānas*.



[5.](vii) He skips alternate jhānas without skipping the
kasiṇas in the following way: having first attained the first jhāna in
the earth kasiṇa, he attains the third jhāna in that same kasiṇa, and
after that, having removed \[the kasiṇa (X.6), he attains\] the base
consisting of boundless space, after that the base consisting of
nothingness. This is called *skipping jhānas*. And that based on the
water kasiṇa, etc., should be construed similarly. (viii) When he skips
alternate kasiṇas without skipping jhānas in the following way: having
attained the first jhāna in the earth kasiṇa, he again attains that same
jhāna in the fire kasiṇa and then in the blue kasiṇa and then in the red
kasiṇa, this is called *skipping kasiṇas*. (ix) When he skips both
jhānas and kasiṇas in the following way: having attained the first jhāna
in the earth kasiṇa, he next attains the third in the fire kasiṇa, next
the base consisting of boundless space after removing the blue kasiṇa,
next the base consisting of nothingness \[arrived at\] from the red
kasiṇa, this is called *skipping jhānas and kasiṇas*.



[6.](x) Attaining the first jhāna in the earth kasiṇa \[375\]
and then attaining the others in that same kasiṇa is called
*transposition of factors*. (xi) Attaining the first jhāna in the earth
kasiṇa and then that same jhāna in the water kasiṇa ... in the white
kasiṇa is called *transposition of object*. (xii) Transposition of
object and factors together takes place in the following way: he attains
the first jhāna in the earth kasiṇa, the second jhāna in the water
kasiṇa, the third in the fire kasiṇa, the fourth in the air kasiṇa, the
base consisting of boundless space by removing the blue kasiṇa, the base
consisting of boundless consciousness \[arrived at\] from the yellow
kasiṇa, the base consisting of nothingness from the red kasiṇa,



[]



[]



and the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception from
the white kasiṇa. This is called *transposition of factors and object*.



[7.](xiii) The defining of only the jhāna factors by defining
the first jhāna as five- factored, the second as three-factored, the
third as two-factored, and likewise the fourth, the base consisting of
boundless space, ... and the base consisting of neither perception nor
non-perception, is called *definition of factors*. (xiv) Likewise, the
defining of only the object as "This is the earth kasiṇa," "This is the
water kasiṇa" ... "This is the white kasiṇa," is called *definition of
object*. Some would also have "defining of factors and object"; but
since that is not given in the commentaries it is certainly not a
heading in the development.



[8.] It is not possible for a meditator to begin to accomplish
transformation by supernormal powers unless he has previously completed
his development by controlling his mind in these fourteen ways. Now, the
kasiṇa preliminary work is difficult for a beginner and only one in a
hundred or a thousand can do it. The arousing of the sign is difficult
for one who has done the preliminary work and only one in a hundred or a
thousand can do it. To extend the sign when it has arisen and to reach
absorption is difficult and only one in a hundred or a thousand can do
it. To tame one's mind in the fourteen ways after reaching absorption is
difficult and only one in a hundred or a thousand can do it. The
transformation by supernormal power after training one's mind in the
fourteen ways is difficult and only one in a hundred or a thousand can
do it. Rapid response after attaining transformation is difficult and
only one in a hundred or a thousand can do it.



[9.] Like the Elder Rakkhita who, eight years after his full
admission to the Order, was in the midst of thirty thousand bhikkhus
possessing supernormal powers who had come to attend upon the sickness
of the Elder Mahā-Rohaṇa- Gutta at Therambatthala. \[376\] His feat is
mentioned under the earth kasiṇa (IV.135). Seeing his feat, an elder
said, "Friends, if Rakkhita had not been there, we should have been put
to shame. \[It could have been said\], 'They were unable to protect the
royal nāga.' So we ourselves ought to go about \[with our abilities
perfected\], just as it is proper (for soldiers) to go about with
weapons cleaned of stains." The thirty thousand bhikkhus heeded the
elder's advice and achieved rapid response.



[10.] And helping another after acquiring rapidity in
responding is difficult and only one in a hundred or a thousand can do
it. Like the elder who gave protection against the rain of embers by
creating earth in the sky, when the rain of embers was produced by Māra
at the *Giribhaṇḍavahana* offering. 2



[11.] It is only in Buddhas, Paccekabuddhas, chief disciples,
etc., who have vast



previous endeavour behind them, that this transformation by supernormal
power



2.  *Giribhaṇḍavahanapūjā*: Vism-mhṭ (p. 375) says:
"*Giribhaṇḍa-vahanapūjā nāma Cetiyagiriṃ ādiṃ katvā sakaladīpe samudde
ca yāva yojanā mahatī dīpapūjā* ('it is a name for a great
island-offering starting with the Cetiyagiri (Mihintale) and extending
over the whole island and up to a league into the sea ')." Mentioned in
A-a to AN 1:1; M-a II 398; and *Mahāvaṃsa* XXXIV.81.



[]



[]



and other such special qualities as the discriminations are brought to
success simply with the attainment of Arahantship and without the
progressive course of development of the kind just described.



[12.] So just as when a goldsmith wants to make some kind of
ornament, he does so only after making the gold malleable and wieldy by
smelting it, etc., and just as when a potter wants to make some kind of
vessel, he does so only after making the clay well kneaded and
malleable, a beginner too must likewise prepare for the kinds of
supernormal powers by controlling his mind in these fourteen ways; and
he must do so also by making his mind malleable and wieldy both by
attaining under the headings of zeal, consciousness, energy, and
inquiry,3 and by mastery in adverting, and so on. But one who already
has the required condition for it owing to practice in previous lives
needs only prepare himself by acquiring mastery in the fourth jhāna in
the kasiṇas.



[13.] Now, the Blessed One showed how the preparation should be
done in saying, "When his concentrated mind," and so on. Here is the
explanation, which follows the text (see §2). Herein, *he* is a
meditator who has attained the fourth jhāna. *Thus* signifies the order
in which the fourth jhāna comes; having obtained the fourth jhāna in
this order beginning with attaining the first jhāna, is what is meant.
*Concentrated*: concentrated by means of the fourth jhāna. *Mind*:
fine-material-sphere consciousness.



[14.] But as to the words "purified," etc., it is *purified* by
means of the state of mindfulness purified by equanimity. \[377\] It is
*bright* precisely because it is *purified*; it is limpid (see A I 10),
is what is meant. It is *unblemished* since the blemishes consisting of
greed, etc., are eliminated by the removal of their conditions
consisting of bliss, and the rest. It is *rid of defilement* precisely
because it is unblemished; for it is by the blemish that the
consciousness becomes defiled. It has *become malleable* because it is
well developed; it suffers mastery, is what is meant, for consciousness
that suffers mastery is called "malleable." It is *wieldy* (*kammanīya*)
precisely because it is malleable; it suffers being worked
(*kammakkhama*), is fit to be worked (*kammayogga*), is what is meant.



[15.] For a malleable consciousness is wieldy, like
well-smelted gold; and it is both of these because it is well developed,
according as it is said: "Bhikkhus, I do not see anyone thing that, when
developed and cultivated, becomes so malleable and wieldy as does the
mind" (A I 9).



[16.] It is *steady* because it is steadied in this
purifiedness, and the rest. It is *attained to imperturbability* 
(*āneñjappatta*) precisely because it is steady; it is motionless,
without perturbation (*niriñjana*), is what is meant. Or alternatively,
it is steady because steady in its own masterability through
malleability and wieldiness, and it is *attained to imperturbability*
because it is reinforced by faith, and so on.



[17.] For consciousness reinforced by faith is not perturbed by
faithlessness; when reinforced by energy, it is not perturbed by
idleness; when reinforced by mindfulness, it is not perturbed by
negligence; when reinforced by concentration,



3\. These are the four headings of the roads to power (see §50).



[]



[]



it is not perturbed by agitation; when reinforced by understanding, it
is not perturbed by ignorance; and when illuminated, it is not perturbed
by the darkness of defilement. So when it is reinforced by these six
states, it is attained to imperturbability.



[18.] Consciousness possessing these eight factors in this way
is susceptible of being directed to the realization by direct-knowledge
of states realizable by direct-knowledge.



[19.] Another method: It is *concentrated* by means of
fourth-jhāna concentration. It is *purified* by separation from the
hindrances. It is *bright* owing to the surmounting of applied thought
and the rest. It is *unblemished* owing to absence of evil wishes based
on the obtainment of jhāna.4 It is *rid of defilement* owing to the
disappearance of the defilements of the mind consisting in covetousness,
etc.; and both of these should be understood according to the Anaṅgaṇa
Sutta (MN 5) and the Vattha Sutta (MN 7). It is *become malleable* by
masterability. It is *wieldy* by reaching the state of a road to power
(§50). It is *steady and attained to imperturbability* by reaching the
refinement of completed development; the meaning is that according as it
has attained imperturbability so it is steady. And the consciousness
possessing these eight factors in this way \[378\] is susceptible of
being directed to the realization by direct-knowledge of states
realizable by direct-knowledge, since it is the basis, the proximate
cause, for them.



[20.] *He directs, he inclines, his mind to the kinds of
supernormal powers*  (*iddhi-* *vidha---*lit. "kinds of success"): here
"success" (*iddhi*) is the success of succeeding (*ijjhana*); in the
sense of production, in the sense of obtainment, is what is meant. For
what is produced and obtained is called "successful," according as it is
said, "When a mortal desires, if his desire is fulfilled" (*samijjhati*)
(Sn 766), and likewise: "Renunciation succeeds (*ijjhati*), thus it is a
success (*iddhi*) ... It metamorphoses (*paṭiharati*) \[lust\], thus it
is a metamorphosis (*pāṭihāriya*)5 ... The Arahant path succeeds, thus
it is a success ... It metamorphoses \[all defilements\], thus it is a
metamorphosis" (Paṭis II 229).



[21.] Another method: success is in the sense of succeeding.
That is a term for the effectiveness of the means; for effectiveness of
the means succeeds with the production of the result intended, according
as it is said: "This householder Citta is virtuous and magnanimous. If
he should aspire, 'Let me in the future become a Wheel-turning Monarch,'
being virtuous, he will succeed in his aspiration, because it is
purified" (S IV 303).



[22.] Another method: beings succeed by its means, thus it is
success. They



succeed, thus they are successful; they are enriched, promoted, is what
is meant.



4\. I.e. one wants it to be known that he can practice jhāna.



5\. "It counter-strikes (*paṭiharati)*, thus it is a counter-stroke
(*pāṭihāriya---*metamorphosis = miracle). What strikes out (*harati)*,
removes, what is counter to it (*paṭipakkha)* is\
therefore called counter-striking (*paṭihāriya)*, since what is
counter-striking strikes out anything counter (*paṭipakkha)* to itself.
*Paṭihāriya* (counter-striking) is the same as *pāṭihāriya *
(counter-stroke = metamorphosis = miracle)" (Vism-mhṭ 379).



[]



[]



That \[success (power)\] is of ten kinds, according as it is said,
"Kinds of success: ten kinds of success," after which it is said
further, "What ten kinds of success? Success by resolve, success as
transformation, success as the mind-made \[body\], success by
intervention of knowledge, success by intervention of concentration,
Noble Ones' success, success born of kamma result, success of the
meritorious, success through the sciences, success in the sense of
succeeding due to right exertion applied here or there" (Paṭis II 205).



[23.] (i) Herein, the success shown in the exposition \[of the
above summary\] thus, "Normally one, he adverts to \[himself as\] many
or a hundred or a thousand or a hundred thousand; having adverted, he
resolves with knowledge, "Let me be many" (Paṭis II 207), is called
*success by resolve* because it is produced by resolving.



[24.] (ii) That given as follows, "Having abandoned his normal
form, he shows \[himself in\] the form of a boy or the form of a serpent
... or he shows a manifold military array" (Paṭis II 210), is called
*success as transformation* because of the abandoning and alteration of
the normal form. \[379\]



[25.] (iii) That given in this way, "Here a bhikkhu creates out
of this body another body possessing visible form, mind-made" (Paṭis II
210), is called *success as the mind-made* (body) because it occurs as
the production of another, mind-made, body inside the body.



[26.] (iv) A distinction brought about by the influence of
knowledge either before the arising of the knowledge or after it or at
that moment is called *success by intervention of knowledge*; for this
is said: "The meaning (purpose) as abandoning perception of permanence
succeeds through contemplation of impermanence, thus it is success by
intervention of knowledge ... The meaning (purpose) as abandoning all
defilements succeeds through the Arahant path, thus it is success by
intervention of knowledge. There was success by intervention of
knowledge in the venerable Bakkula. There was success by intervention of
knowledge in the venerable Saṅkicca. There was success by intervention
of knowledge in the venerable Bhūtapāla" (Paṭis II 211).



[27.] Herein, when the venerable Bakkula as an infant was being
bathed in the river on an auspicious day, he fell into the stream
through the negligence of his nurse. A fish swallowed him and eventually
came to the bathing place at Benares. There it was caught by a fisherman
and sold to a rich man's wife. The fish interested her, and thinking to
cook it herself, she slit it open. When she did so, she saw the child
like a golden image in the fish's stomach. She was overjoyed, thinking,
"At last I have got a son." So the venerable Bakkula's safe survival in
a fish's stomach in his last existence is called "success by
intervention of knowledge" because it was brought about by the influence
of the Arahant-path knowledge due to be obtained by \[him in\] that
life. But the story should be told in detail (see M-a IV 190).



[28.] The Elder Saṅkicca's mother died while he was still in
her womb. At the time of her cremation she was pierced by stakes and
placed on a pyre. The infant received a wound on the corner of his eye
from the point of a stake and made a sound. Then, thinking that the
child must be alive, they took down the body and



[]



[]



opened its belly. They gave the child to the grandmother. Under her care
he grew up, and eventually he went forth and reached Arahantship
together with the discriminations. So the venerable Saṅkicca's safe
survival on the pyre is called, "success by intervention of knowledge"
in the way just stated (see Dhp-a II 240).



[29.] The boy Bhūtapāla's father was a poor man in Rājagaha.
\[380\] He went into the forest with a cart to get a load of wood. It
was evening when he returned to the city gate. Then his oxen slipped the
yoke and escaped into the city. He seated the child beside the cart and
went into the city after the oxen. Before he could come out again, the
gate was closed. The child's safe survival through the three watches of
the night outside the city in a place infested by wild beasts and
spirits is called, "success by intervention of knowledge" in the way
just stated. But the story should be told in detail.



[30.] (v) A distinction brought about by the influence of
serenity either before the concentration or after it or at that moment
is called *success by intervention of concentration* for this is said:
"The meaning (purpose) as abandoning the hindrances succeeds by means of
the first jhāna, thus it is success by intervention of concentration ...
The meaning (purpose) as abandoning the base consisting of nothingness
succeeds by means of the attainment of the base consisting of neither
perception nor non-perception, thus it is success by intervention of
concentration. There was success by intervention of concentration in the
venerable Sāriputta ... in the venerable Sañjīva ... in the venerable
Khāṇu-Kondañña ... in the laywoman devotee Uttarā ... in the lay-woman
devotee Sāmāvatī" (Paṭis II 211--12).



[31.] Herein, while the venerable Sāriputta was living with the
Elder Mahā Moggallāna at Kapotakandarā he was sitting in the open on a
moonlit night with his hair newly cut. Then a wicked spirit, though
warned by his companion, gave him a blow on the head, the noise of which
was like a thunder clap. At the time the blow was given the elder was
absorbed in an attainment; consequently he suffered no harm from the
blow. This was success by intervention of concentration in that
venerable one. The story is given in the Udāna too (Ud 39).



[32.] While the Elder Sañjīva was in the attainment of
cessation, cowherds, etc., who noticed him thought he was dead. They
brought grass and sticks and cow- dung and set fire to them. Not even a
corner of the elder's robe was burnt. This was success by intervention
of concentration in him because it was brought about by the influence of
the serenity occurring in his successive attainment \[of each of the
eight jhānas preceding cessation\]. But the story is given in the Suttas
too (M I 333).



[33.] The Elder Khāṇu Kondañña was naturally gifted in
attainments. He was sitting absorbed in attainment one night in a
certain forest. \[381\] Five hundred robbers came by with stolen booty.
Thinking that no one was following them and needing rest, they put the
booty down. Believing the elder was a tree stump (*khāṇuka*), they piled
all the booty on him. The elder emerged at the predetermined time just
as they were about to depart after resting, at the very time in fact
when the one who had put his booty down first was picking it up. When
they saw the elder move, they cried out in fear. The elder said, "Do not
be afraid, lay followers;



[]



[]



I am a bhikkhu." They came and paid homage. Such was their confidence in
the elder that they went forth into homelessness, and they eventually
reached Arahantship together with the discriminations. The absence here
of harm to the elder, covered as he was by five hundred bundles of
goods, was success by intervention of concentration (see Dhp-a II 254).



[34.] The laywoman devotee Uttarā was the daughter of a rich
man called Puṇṇaka. A harlot called Sirimā who was envious of her,
poured a basin of hot oil over her head. At that moment Uttarā had
attained \[jhāna in\], loving-kindness. The oil ran off her like water
on a lotus leaf. This was success by intervention of concentration in
her. But the story should be given in detail (see Dhp-a III 310; A- a I
451).



[35.] King Udena's chief queen was called Sāmāvatī. The brahman
Māgaṇḍiya, who aspired to elevate his own daughter to the position of
chief queen, put a poisonous snake into Sāmāvatī's lute. Then he told
the king, "Sāmāvatī wants to kill you, sire. She is carrying a poisonous
snake about in her lute." When the king found it, he was furious.
Intending to kill her, he took his bow and aimed a poisoned arrow.
Sāmāvatī with her retinue pervaded the king with loving- kindness. The
king stood trembling, unable either to shoot the arrow or to put it
away. Then the queen said to him, "What is it, sire, are you
tired?"---"Yes, I am tired."---"Then put down the bow." The arrow fell
at the king's feet. Then the queen advised him, "Sire, one should not
hate one who has no hate." So the king's not daring to release the arrow
was success by intervention of concentration in the laywoman Sāmāvatī
(see Dhp-a I 216; A-a I 443).



[36.] (vi) That which consists in dwelling perceiving the
unrepulsive in the repulsive, etc., is called *Noble Ones' success*,
according as it is said: "What is Noble Ones' success? Here, if a
bhikkhu should wish, "May I dwell perceiving the unrepulsive in the
repulsive," he dwells perceiving the unrepulsive in that ... he dwells
in equanimity towards that, mindful and fully aware" (Paṭis II 212).
\[382\] This is called "Noble Ones' success" because it is only produced
in Noble Ones who have reached mind mastery.



[37.] For if a bhikkhu with cankers destroyed possesses this
kind of success, then when in the case of a disagreeable object he is
practicing pervasion with loving-kindness or giving attention to it as
elements, he dwells perceiving the unrepulsive; or when in the case of
an agreeable object he is practicing pervasion with foulness or giving
attention to it as impermanent, he dwells perceiving the repulsive.
Likewise, when in the case of the repulsive and unrepulsive he is
practicing that same pervasion with loving-kindness or giving attention
to it as elements, he dwells perceiving the unrepulsive; and when in the
case of the unrepulsive and repulsive he is practicing that same
pervasion with foulness or giving attention to it as impermanent, he
dwells perceiving the repulsive. But when he is exercising the
six-factored equanimity in the following way, "On seeing a visible
object with the eye, he is neither glad nor ..." (Paṭis II 213), etc.,
then rejecting both the repulsive and the unrepulsive, he dwells in
equanimity, mindful and fully aware.



[]



[]



[38.] For the meaning of this is expounded in the Paṭisambhidā
in the way beginning: "How does he dwell perceiving the unrepulsive in
the repulsive? In the case of a disagreeable object he pervades it with
loving-kindness or he treats it as elements" (Paṭis II 212). Thus it is
called, "Noble Ones' success" because it is only produced in Noble Ones
who have reached mind mastery.



[39.] (vii) That consisting in travelling through the air in
the case of winged birds, etc., is called *success born of kamma
result*, according as it is said: "What is success born of kamma result?
That in all winged birds, in all deities, in some human beings, in some
inhabitants of states of loss, is success born of kamma result" (Paṭis
II 213). For here it is the capacity in all winged birds to travel
through the air without jhāna or insight that is success born of kamma
result; and likewise that in all deities, and some human beings, at the
beginning of the aeon, and likewise that in some inhabitants of states
of loss such as the female spirit Piyaṅkara's mother (see S-a II 509),
Uttara's mother (Pv 140), Phussamittā, Dhammaguttā, and so on.



[40.] (viii) That consisting in travelling through the air,
etc., in the case of Wheel- turning Monarchs, etc., is called *success
of the meritorious*, according as it is said: "What is success of the
meritorious? The Wheel-turning Monarch travels through the air with his
fourfold army, even with his grooms and shepherds. The householder
Jotika had the success of the meritorious. The householder Jaṭilaka had
the success of the meritorious. \[383\] The householder Ghosita had the
success of the meritorious. The householder Meṇḍaka had the success of
the meritorious. That of the five very meritorious is success of the
meritorious" (Paṭis II 213). In brief, however, it is the distinction
that consists in succeeding when the accumulated merit comes to ripen
that is success of the meritorious.



[41.] A crystal palace and sixty-four wishing trees cleft the
earth and sprang into existence for the householder Jotika. That was
success of the meritorious in his case (Dhp-a IV 207). A golden rock of
eighty cubits \[high\] was made for Jaṭilaka (Dhp-a IV 216). Ghosita's
safe survival when attempts were made in seven places to kill him was
success of the meritorious (Dhp-a I 174). The appearance to Meṇḍaka (=
Ram) of rams (*meṇḍaka*) made of the seven gems in a\
place the size of one *sītā* 6 was success of the meritorious in Meṇḍaka
(Dhp-a III 364).



[42.] The "five very meritorious" are the rich man Meṇḍaka, his
wife Candapadumasiri, his son the rich man Dhanañjaya, his
daughter-in-law Sumanadevī, and his slave Puṇṇa. When the rich man
\[Meṇḍaka\] washed his head and looked up at the sky, twelve thousand
five hundred measures were filled for him with red rice from the sky.
When his wife took a *nāḷi* measure of cooked rice, the food was not
used up though she served the whole of Jambudīpa with it. When his son
took a purse containing a thousand \[ducats (*kahāpaṇa*)\], the ducats
were not exhausted even though he made gifts to all the inhabitants



6\. *Sītā:* not in this sense in PED. Vism-mhṭ (p. 383) says, "It is the
path traversed by a ploughshare in ploughing that is called a *sītā*."
Another reading is *karīsa* (an area of land).



[]



[]



of Jambudīpa. When his daughter-in-law took a pint (*tumba*) measure of
paddy, the grain was not used up even when she shared it out among all
the inhabitants of Jambudīpa. When the slave ploughed with a single
ploughshare, there were fourteen furrows, seven on each side (see Vin I
240; Dhp-a I 384). This was success of the meritorious in them.



[43.] (ix) That beginning with travelling through the air in
the case of masters of the sciences is *success through the sciences*,
according as it is said: "What is success through the sciences? Masters
of the sciences, having pronounced their scientific spells, travel
through the air, and they show an elephant in space, in the sky ... and
they show a manifold military array" (Paṭis II 213).



[44.] (x) But the succeeding of such and such work through such
and such right exertion is *success in the sense of succeeding due to
right exertion applied here or there*, according as it is said: "The
meaning (purpose) of abandoning lust succeeds through renunciation, thus
it is success in the sense of succeeding due to right exertion applied
here or there ... The meaning (purpose) of abandoning all defilements
succeeds through the Arahant path, thus it is success in the sense of
succeeding due to right exertion applied here or there" (Paṭis II 213).
\[384\] And the text here is similar to the previous text in the
illustration of right exertion, in other words, the way. But in the
Commentary it is given as follows: "Any work belonging to a trade such
as making a cart assemblage, etc., any medical work, the learning of the
Three Vedas, the learning of the Three Piṭakas, even any work connected
with ploughing, sowing, etc.---the distinction produced by doing such
work is success in the sense of succeeding due to right exertion applied
here or there."



[45.] So, among these ten kinds of success, only (i) success by
resolve is actually mentioned in the clause "kinds of supernormal power
(success)," but (ii) success as transformation and (iii) success as the
mind-made \[body\] are needed in this sense as well.



[46.] (i)  *To the kinds of supernormal power* (see §20): to
the components of supernormal power, or to the departments of
supernormal power. *He directs, he inclines, his mind*: when that
bhikkhu's consciousness has become the basis for direct-knowledge in the
way already described, he directs the preliminary-work consciousness
with the purpose of attaining the kinds of supernormal power, he sends
it in the direction of the kinds of supernormal power, leading it away
from the kasiṇa as its object. Inclines: makes it tend and lean towards
the supernormal power to be attained.



[47.] *He*: the bhikkhu who has done the directing of his mind
in this way. *The* *various*: varied, of different sorts. *Kinds of
supernormal power*: departments of supernormal power. *Wields*:
*paccanubhoti* = *paccanu-bhavati* (alternative form); the\
meaning is that he makes contact with, realizes, reaches.



[48.] Now, in order to show that variousness, it is said:
"Having been one, \[he becomes many; having been many, he becomes one.
He appears and vanishes. He goes unhindered through walls, through
enclosures, through mountains, as though in open space. He dives in and
out of the earth as though in water. He goes on unbroken water as though
on earth. Seated cross-legged he travels in space like a winged bird.
With his hand he



[]



[]



touches and strokes the moon and sun so mighty and powerful. He wields
bodily mastery even as far as the Brahmā-world\]" (D I 77).



Herein, *having been one*: having been normally one before giving effect
to the supernormal power. *He becomes many*: wanting to walk with many
or wanting to do a recital or wanting to ask questions with many, he
becomes a hundred or a thousand. But how does he do this? He
accomplishes, (1) the four planes, (2) the four bases (roads), (3) the
eight steps, and (4) the sixteen roots of supernormal power, and then he
(5) resolves with knowledge.



[49.] *1.* Herein, the *four planes* should be understood as
the four jhānas; for this has been said by the General of the Dhamma
\[the Elder Sāriputta\]: "What are the four planes of supernormal power?
They are the first jhāna as the plane born of seclusion, the second
jhāna as the plane of happiness and bliss, the third jhāna as the plane
of equanimity and bliss, the fourth jhāna as the plane of neither pain
nor pleasure. These four planes of supernormal power lead to the
attaining of supernormal power, to the obtaining of supernormal power,
to the transformation due to supernormal power, to the majesty7 of
supernormal power, to the mastery of supernormal power, to fearlessness
in supernormal power" (Paṭis II 205). And he reaches supernormal power
by becoming light, malleable and wieldy in the body after steeping
himself in blissful perception and light perception due to the pervasion
of happiness and pervasion of bliss, \[385\] which is why the first
three jhānas should be understood as the accessory plane since they lead
to the obtaining of supernormal power in this manner. But the fourth is
the natural plane for obtaining supernormal power.



[50.] *2.* The *four bases (roads)* should be understood as the
four bases of success (*iddhi-pāda---*roads to power); for this is said:
"What are the four bases (*pāda---* roads) for success
(*iddhi---*power)? Here a bhikkhu develops the basis for success (road
to power) that possesses both concentration due to zeal and the will to
strive (endeavour); he develops the basis for success (road to power)
that possesses both concentration due to energy and the will to strive;
he develops the basis for success (road to power) that possesses both
concentration due to \[natural purity of\] consciousness and the will to
strive; he develops the basis for success (road to power) that possesses
both concentration due to inquiry and the will to strive. These four
bases (roads) for success (power) lead to the obtaining of supernormal
power (success) ... to the fearlessness due to supernormal power
(success)" (Paṭis II 205).



[51.]And here the concentration that has zeal as its cause, or
has zeal outstanding, is  *concentration due to zeal*; this is a term
for concentration obtained by giving precedence to zeal consisting in
the desire to act. Will (formation) as endeavour is *will to strive*;
this is a term for the energy of right endeavour accomplishing its
fourfold function (see §53). *Possesses*: is furnished with
concentration due to zeal and with the \[four\] instances of the will to
strive.



7\. *Visavitā---*"majesty": not in PED; cf. *passavati.* Vism-mhṭ (p.
385) glosses with *iddhiyā vividhānisaṃsa-pasavanāya.* Cf. Dhs-a 109;
Dhs-ṭ (p. 84) glosses thus *visavitāyā ti arahatāya.*



[]



[]



[52.] *Road to power (basis for success)*: the meaning is, the
total of consciousness and its remaining concomitants \[except the
concentration and the will\], which are, in the sense of resolve, the
road to (basis for) the concentration due to zeal and will to strive
associated with the direct-knowledge consciousness, which latter are
themselves termed "power (success)" either by treatment as "production"
(§20) or in the sense of "succeeding" (§21) or by treatment in this way,
"beings succeed by its means, thus they are successful; they are
enriched, promoted" (§22). For this is said: "Basis for success (road to
power): it is the feeling aggregate, \[perception aggregate, formations
aggregate, and\] consciousness aggregate, in one so become" (Vibh 217).



[53.] Or alternatively: it is arrived at (*pajjate*) by means
of that, thus that is a road (*pāda---*basis); it is reached, is the
meaning. *Iddhi-pāda = iddhiyā pāda* (resolution of compound): this is a
term for zeal, etc., according as it is said: "Bhikkhus, if a bhikkhu
obtains concentration, obtains unification of mind supported by zeal,
this is called concentration due to zeal. He \[awakens zeal\] for the
non-arising of unarisen evil, unprofitable states, \[strives, puts forth
energy, strains his mind and\] struggles. \[He awakens zeal for the
abandoning of arisen evil, unprofitable states ... He awakens zeal for
the arousing of unarisen profitable states ... He awakens zeal for the
maintenance, non-disappearance, increase, growth, development and
perfection of arisen profitable states, strives, puts forth energy,
strains his mind and struggles\]. These are called instances of the will
to strive. So this zeal and this concentration due to zeal and these
\[four\] instances of will to strive are called the road to power (basis
for success) that possesses concentration due to zeal and the will to
strive" (S V 268). And the meaning should be understood in this way in
the case of the other roads to power (bases for success).8



[54.] *3.* The *eight steps* should be understood as the eight
beginning with zeal; for this is said: "What are the eight steps? If a
bhikkhu obtains concentration, obtains unification of mind supported by
zeal, then the zeal is not the concentration; the concentration is not
the zeal. \[386\] The zeal is one, the concentration is another. If a
bhikkhu ... supported by energy ... supported by \[natural purity of\]
consciousness ... supported by inquiry ... then the inquiry is not the
concentration; the concentration is not the inquiry. The inquiry is one,
the concentration is another. These eight steps to power lead to the
obtaining of supernormal power (success) ... to fearlessness due to
supernormal power (success)" (Paṭis II 205). For here it is the zeal
consisting in the desire to arouse supernormal power (success), which
zeal is joined with concentration, that leads to the obtaining of the
supernormal power. Similarly in the case of energy, and so on. That
should be understood as the reason why they are called the "eight
steps."



[55.] *4.* The *sixteen roots*: the mind's unperturbedness9
should be understood in



sixteen modes, for this is said: "What are the sixteen roots of success
(power)?



8\. Further explanatory details are given in the commentary to the
Iddhipāda Vibhaṅga.



9\. *Aneja* (or *aneñja*)---"unperturbed": form not in PED.



[]



[]



Undejected consciousness is not perturbed by indolence, thus it is
unperturbed. Unelated consciousness is not perturbed by agitation, thus
it is unperturbed. Unattracted consciousness is not perturbed by greed,
thus it is unperturbed. Unrepelled consciousness is not perturbed by ill
will, thus it is unperturbed. Independent consciousness is not perturbed
by \[false\] view, thus it is unperturbed. Untrammelled consciousness is
not perturbed by greed accompanied by zeal, thus it is unperturbed.
Liberated consciousness is not perturbed by greed for sense desires,
thus it is unperturbed. Unassociated consciousness is not perturbed by
defilement, thus it is unperturbed. Consciousness rid of barriers is not
perturbed by the barrier of defilement, thus it is unperturbed. Unified
consciousness is not perturbed by the defilement of variety, thus it is
unperturbed. Consciousness reinforced by faith is not perturbed by
faithlessness, thus it is unperturbed. Consciousness reinforced by
energy is not perturbed by indolence, thus it is unperturbed.
Consciousness reinforced by mindfulness is not perturbed by negligence,
thus it is unperturbed. Consciousness reinforced by concentration is not
perturbed by agitation, thus it is unperturbed. Consciousness reinforced
by understanding is not perturbed by ignorance, thus it is unperturbed.
Illuminated consciousness is not perturbed by the darkness of ignorance,
thus it is unperturbed. These sixteen roots of success (power) lead to
the obtaining of supernormal power (success) ... to fearlessness due to
supernormal power (success)" (Paṭis II 206).



[56.] Of course, this meaning is already established by the
words, "When his concentrated mind," etc., too, but it is stated again
for the purpose of showing that the first jhāna, etc., are the three
planes, bases (roads), steps, and roots, of success (to supernormal
powers). And the first-mentioned method is the one given in the Suttas,
but this is how it is given in the Paṭisambhidā. So it is stated again
for the purpose of avoiding confusion in each of the two instances.



[57.] *5.* *He resolves with knowledge* (§48): when he has
accomplished these things consisting of the planes, bases (roads),
steps, and roots, of success (to supernormal power), \[387\] then he
attains jhāna as the basis for direct-knowledge and emerges from it.
Then if he wants to become a hundred, he does the preliminary work thus,
"Let me become a hundred, let me become a hundred," after which he again
attains jhāna as basis for direct-knowledge, emerges, and resolves. He
becomes a hundred simultaneously with the resolving consciousness. The
same method applies in the case of a thousand, and so on. If he does not
succeed in this way, he should do the preliminary work again, and
attain, emerge, and resolve a second time. For it is said in the
Saṃyutta Commentary that it is allowable to attain once, or twice.



[58.] Herein, the basic-jhāna consciousness has the sign as its
object; but the preliminary-work consciousnesses have the hundred as
their object or the thousand as their object. And these latter are
objects as appearances, not as concepts. The resolving consciousness has
likewise the hundred as its object or the thousand as its object. That
arises once only, next to change-of-lineage \[consciousness\], as in the
case of absorption consciousness already described (IV.78), and it is
fine-material-sphere consciousness belonging to the fourth jhāna.



[]



[]



[59.] Now, it is said in the Paṭisambhidā: "Normally one, he
adverts to \[himself as\] many or a hundred or a thousand or a hundred
thousand; having adverted, he resolves with knowledge, 'Let me be many.'
He becomes many, like the venerable Cūḷa-Panthaka" (Paṭis II 207). Here
*he adverts* is said with respect only to the preliminary work. *Having
adverted, he resolves with knowledge* is said with respect to the
knowledge of the direct-knowledge. Consequently, he adverts to many.
After that he attains with the last one of the preliminary-work
consciousnesses. After emerging from the attainment, he again adverts
thus, "Let me be many," after which he resolves by means of the single
\[consciousness\] belonging to the knowledge of direct-knowledge, which
has arisen next to the three, or four, preparatory consciousnesses that
have occurred, and which has the name "resolve" owing to its making the
decision. This is how the meaning should be understood here.



[60.] *Like the venerable Cūḷa-Panthaka* is said in order to
point to a bodily witness of this multiple state; but that must be
illustrated by the story. There were two brothers, it seems, who were
called, "Panthaka (Roadling)" because they were born on a road. The
senior of the two was called Mahā-Panthaka. He went forth into
homelessness and reached Arahantship together with the discriminations.
When he had become an Arahant, he made Cūḷa-Panthaka go forth too, and
he set him this stanza: \[388\]



As a scented *kokanada* lotus\
Opens in the morning with its perfume,\
See the One with Radiant Limbs who glitters10\
Like the sun's orb blazing in the heavens (A III 239; S I 81).



Four months went by, but he could not get it by heart. Then the elder
said,



"You are useless in this dispensation," and he expelled him from the
monastery.



[61.] At that time the elder had charge of the allocation of
meal \[invitations\]. Jīvaka approached the elder, saying, "Take alms at
our house, venerable sir, together with the Blessed One and five hundred
bhikkhus." The elder consented, saying, "I accept for all but
Cūḷa-Panthaka." Cūḷa-Panthaka stood weeping at the gate. The Blessed One
saw him with the divine eye, and he went to him. "Why are you weeping?"
he asked, and he was told what had happened.



[62.] The Blessed One said, "No one in my dispensation is
called useless for being unable to do a recitation. Do not grieve,
bhikkhu." Taking him by the arm, he led him into the monastery. He
created a piece of cloth by supernormal power and gave it to him,
saying, "Now, bhikkhu, keep rubbing this and recite over and over again:
'Removal of dirt, removal of dirt.'" While doing as he had been told,
the cloth became black in colour. What he came to perceive was this:
"The cloth is clean; there is nothing wrong there. It is this selfhood
that is wrong." He brought his knowledge to bear on the five aggregates,
and by increasing insight he reached the neighbourhood of conformity
\[knowledge\] and change-of-lineage \[knowledge\].



10\. *Aṅgīrasa---*"the One with Radiant Limbs": one of the epithets for
the Buddha. Not in PED; see A III 239.



[]



[]



[63.]Then the Blessed One uttered these illuminative stanzas:



Now greed it is, not dust, that we call "dirt,"\
And "dirt" is just a term in use for greed;\
This greed the wise reject, and they abide\
Keeping the Law of him that has no greed.\
Now, hate it is, not dust, that we call "dirt,"\
...



... ...



Delusion too, it is not dust, that we call "dirt,"\
And "dirt" is just a term used for delusion;\
Delusion the wise reject, and they abide\
Keeping the Dhamma of him without delusion (Nidd I 505).\
\[389\]



When the stanzas were finished, the venerable Cūḷa-Panthaka had at his
command the nine supramundane states attended by the four
discriminations and six kinds of direct-knowledge.



[64.] On the following day the Master went to Jīvaka's house
together with the Community of Bhikkhus. Then when the gruel was being
given out at the end of the water-offering ceremony,11 he covered his
bowl. Jīvaka asked, "What is it, venerable sir?"---"There is a bhikkhu
at the monastery." He sent a man, telling him, "Go, and return quickly
with the lord."



[65.] When the Blessed One had left the monastery:



Now, having multiplied himself\
Up to a thousand, Panthaka\
Sat in the pleasant mango wood\
until the time should be announced (Th 563).



[66.] When the man went and saw the monastery all glowing with
yellow, he returned and said, "Venerable sir, the monastery is crowded
with bhikkhus. I do not know which of them the lord is." Then the
Blessed One said, "Go and catch hold of the hem of the robe of the first
one you see, tell him, 'The Master calls you' and bring him here." He
went and caught hold of the elder's robe. At once all the creations
vanished. The elder dismissed him, saying, "You may go," and when he had
finished attending to his bodily needs such as mouth washing, he arrived
first and sat down on the seat prepared.



It was with reference to this that it was said, "like the venerable
Cūḷa-Panthaka."



[67.] The many who were created there were just like the
possessor of the supernormal power because they were created without
particular specification. Then whatever the possessor of the supernormal
powers does, whether he stands, sits, etc., or speaks, keeps silent,
etc., they do the same. But if he wants to make them different in
appearance, some in the first phase of life, some in the middle phase,
and some in the last phase, and similarly some long-haired, some
half-shaved, some shaved, some grey-haired, some with lightly dyed
robes, some with heavily dyed robes, or expounding phrases, explaining
Dhamma, intoning, asking questions, answering



11\. Dedication of what is to be given accompanied by pouring water over
the hand.



[]



[]



questions, cooking dye, sewing and washing robes, etc., or if he wants
to make still others of different kinds, he should emerge from the basic
jhāna, do the preliminary work in the way beginning 'Let there be so
many bhikkhus in the first phase of life', etc.; then he should once
more attain and emerge, and then resolve. They become of the kinds
desired simultaneously with the resolving consciousness.12



[68.] The same method of explanation applies to the clause
*having been many, he* *becomes one*: but there is this difference.
After this bhikkhu thus created a manifold state, then he again thinks,
"As one only I will walk about, do a recital, \[390\] ask a question,"
or out of fewness of wishes he thinks, "This is a monastery with few
bhikkhus. If someone comes, he will wonder, 'Where have all these
bhikkhus who are all alike come from? Surely it will be one of the
elder's feats?' and so he might get to know about me." Meanwhile,
wishing, "Let me be one only," he should attain the basic jhāna and
emerge. Then, after doing the preliminary work thus, "Let me be one," he
should again attain and emerge and then resolve thus, 'Let me be one'.
He becomes one simultaneously with the resolving consciousness. But
instead of doing this, he can automatically become one again with the
lapse of the predetermined time.



[69.] *He appears and vanishes*: the meaning here is that he
causes appearance, causes vanishing. For it is said in the Paṭisambhidā
with reference to this: "'He appears': he is not veiled by something, he
is not hidden, he is revealed, he is evident. 'Vanishes': he is veiled
by something, he is hidden, he is shut away, he is enclosed" (Paṭis II
207).13



Now, this possessor of supernormal power who wants to make an
appearance, makes darkness into light, or he makes revealed what is
hidden, or he makes what has not come into the visual field come into
the visual field.



[70.] How? If he wants to make himself or another visible even
though hidden or at a distance, he emerges from the basic jhāna and
adverts thus, "Let this that is dark become light" or "Let this that is
hidden be revealed" or "Let this that has not come into the visual field
come into the visual field." Then he does the preliminary work and
resolves in the way already described. It becomes as resolved
simultaneously with the resolve. Others then see even when at a
distance; and he himself sees too, if he wants to see.



12\. "'*They become of the kinds desired*': they become whatever the
kinds that were desired: for they come to possess as many varieties in
appearance, etc., as it was wished they should have. But although they
become manifold in this way by being made the object in different modes
of appearance, nevertheless it is only a single resolution consciousness
that occurs. This is its power. For it is like the single volition that
produces a personality possessed of many different facets (see Ch. XIV,
n. 14). And there it is the aspiration to become that is a condition for
the differentiation in the kamma; and kamma-result is imponderable. And
here too it is the preliminary-work consciousness that should be taken
as a condition for the difference. And the field of supernormal power is
imponderable too." (Vism-mhṭ 390)\



13\. Certain grammatical problems arise about the case of the words
*āvibhāvaṃ*, etc., both in the sutta passage and (more so) in the
Paṭisambhidā passage; they are examined by Vism-mhṭ (p. 390) but are not
renderable into English.



[]



[]



[71.] But by whom was this miracle formerly performed? By the
Blessed One. For when the Blessed One had been invited by Cūḷa-Subhaddā
and was traversing the seven-league journey between Sāvatthī and Sāketa
with five hundred palanquins14 created by Vissakamma (see Dhp-a III
470), he resolved in suchwise that citizens of Sāketa saw the
inhabitants of Sāvatthī and citizens of Sāvatthī saw the inhabitants of
Sāketa. And when he had alighted in the centre of the city, he split the
earth in two and showed Avīci, and he parted the sky in two and showed
the Brahmā-world.



[72.] And this meaning should also be explained by means of the
Descent of the Gods (*devorohaṇa*). When the Blessed One, it seems, had
performed the Twin Miracle15 and had liberated eighty-four thousand
beings from bonds, he wondered, "Where did the past Enlightened Ones go
to when they had finished the Twin Miracle?" He saw that they had gone
to the heaven of the Thirty-three. \[391\] Then he stood with one foot
on the surface of the earth, and placed the second on Mount Yugandhara.
Then again he lifted his first foot and set it on the summit of Mount
Sineru. He took up the residence for the Rains there on the Red Marble
Terrace, and he began his exposition of the Abhidhamma, starting from
the beginning, to the deities of ten thousand world-spheres. At the time
for wandering for alms he created an artificial Buddha to teach the
Dhamma.



[73.] Meanwhile the Blessed One himself would chew a
tooth-stick of *nāgalatā* wood and wash his mouth in Lake Anotatta.
Then, after collecting alms food among the Uttarakurus, he would eat it
on the shores of that lake. \[Each day\] the Elder Sāriputta went there
and paid homage to the Blessed One, who told him, "Today I taught this
much Dhamma," and he gave him the method. In this way he gave an
uninterrupted exposition of the Abhidhamma for three months. Eighty
million deities penetrated the Dhamma on hearing it.



[74.] At the time of the Twin Miracle an assembly gathered that
was twelve leagues across. Then, saying, "We will disperse when we have
seen the Blessed One," they made an encampment and waited there.
Anāthapiṇḍika the Lesser16 supplied all their needs. People asked the
Elder Anuruddha to find out where the Blessed One was. The elder
extended light, and with the divine eye he saw where the Blessed One had
taken up residence for the Rains. As soon as he saw this, he announced
it.



[75.] They asked the venerable Mahā Moggallāna to pay homage to
the Blessed



One. In the midst of the assembly the elder dived into the earth. Then
cleaving

Mount Sineru, he emerged at the Perfect One's feet, and he paid homage
at the Blessed One's feet. This is what he told the Blessed One:
"Venerable sir, the inhabitants of Jambudīpa pay homage at the Blessed
One's feet, and they say, 'We will disperse when we have seen the
Blessed One.'" The Blessed One said, "But, Moggallāna, where is your
elder brother, the General of the Dhamma?"--- "At the city of Saṅkassa,
venerable sir."---"Moggallāna, those who wish to see me should come
tomorrow to the city of Saṅkassa. Tomorrow being the Uposatha day of the
full moon, I shall descend to the city of Saṅkassa for the Mahāpavāraṇā
ceremony."



[76.] Saying, "Good, venerable sir," the elder paid homage to
Him of the Ten Powers, and descending by the way he came, he reached the
human neighbourhood. And at the time of his going and coming he resolved
that people should see it. This, firstly, is the miracle of becoming
apparent that the Elder Mahā Moggallāna performed here. Having arrived
thus, he related what had happened, and he said, "Come forth after the
morning meal and pay no heed to distance" \[thus promising that they
would be able to see in spite of the distance\].



[77.] The Blessed One informed Sakka, Ruler of Gods, "Tomorrow,
O King, I am going to the human world." The Ruler of Gods \[392\]
commanded Vissakamma, "Good friend, the Blessed One wishes to go to the
human world tomorrow. Build three flights of stairs, one of gold, one of
silver and one of crystal." He did so.



[78.] On the following day the Blessed One stood on the summit
of Sineru and surveyed the eastward world element. Many thousands of
world-spheres were visible to him as clearly as a single plain. And as
the eastward world element, so too he saw the westward, the northward
and the southward world elements all clearly visible. And he saw right
down to Avīci, and up to the Realm of the Highest Gods. That day, it
seems, was called the day of the Revelation of Worlds (*loka-vivaraṇa*).
Human beings saw deities, and deities saw human beings. And in doing so
the human beings did not have to look up or the deities down. They all
saw each other face to face.



[79.] The Blessed One descended by the middle flight of stairs
made of crystal; the deities of the six sense-sphere heavens by that on
the left side made of gold; and the deities of the Pure Abodes, and the
Great Brahmā, by that on the right side made of silver. The Ruler of
Gods held the bowl and robe. The Great Brahmā held a three-league-wide
white parasol. Suyāma held a yak-tail fan. Five-crest (*Pañcasikha*),
the son of the gandhabba, descended doing honour to the Blessed One with
his bael-wood lute measuring three quarters of a league. On that day
there was no living being present who saw the Blessed One but yearned
for enlightenment. This is the miracle of becoming apparent that the
Blessed One performed here.



[80.] Furthermore, in Tambapaṇṇi Island (Sri Lanka), while the
Elder Dhammadinna, resident of Taḷaṅgara, was sitting on the shrine
terrace in the Great Monastery of Tissa (*Tissamahāvihāra*) expounding
the Apaṇṇaka Sutta, "Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu possesses three things he
enters upon the untarnished way" (A I 113), he turned his fan face
downwards and an opening right down to Avīci appeared. Then he turned it
face upwards and an opening



[]



[]



right up to the Brahmā-world appeared. Having thus aroused fear of hell
and longing for the bliss of heaven, the elder taught the Dhamma. Some
became stream-enterers, some once-returners, some non-returners, some
Arahants.



[81.] But one who wants to cause a vanishing makes light into
darkness, or he hides what is unbidden, or he makes what has come into
the visual field come no more into the visual field. How? If he wants to
make himself or another invisible even though unconcealed or nearby, he
emerges from the basic jhāna and adverts thus, "Let this light become
darkness" or \[393\] "Let this that is unhidden be hidden" or "Let this
that has come into the visual field not come into the visual field."
Then he does the preliminary work and resolves in the way already
described. It becomes as he has resolved simultaneously with the
resolution. Others do not see even when they are nearby. He too does not
see, if he does not want to see.



[82.] But by whom was this miracle formerly performed? By the
Blessed One. For the Blessed One so acted that when the clansman Yasa
was sitting beside him, his father did not see him (Vin I 16). Likewise,
after travelling two thousand leagues to meet \[King\] Mahā Kappina and
establishing him in the fruition of non-return and his thousand
ministers in the fruition of stream-entry, he so acted that Queen Anojā,
who had followed the king with a thousand women attendants and was
sitting nearby, did not see the king and his retinue. And when he was
asked, "Have you seen the king, venerable sir?," he asked, But which is
better for you, to seek the king or to seek \[your\] self?" (cf. Vin I
23). She replied, "\[My\] self, venerable sir." Then he likewise taught
her the Dhamma as she sat there, so that, together with the thousand
women attendants, she became established in the fruition of
stream-entry, while the ministers reached the fruition of non-return,
and the king that of Arahantship (see A-a I 322; Dhp-a II 124).



[83.] Furthermore, this was performed by the Elder Mahinda, who
so acted on the day of his arrival in Tambapaṇṇi Island that the king
did not see the others who had come with him (see *Mahāvaṃsa* I 103).



[84.] Furthermore, all miracles of making evident are called an
appearance, and all miracles of making unevident are called a vanishing.
Herein, in the miracle of making evident, both the supernormal power and
the possessor of the supernormal power are displayed. That can be
illustrated with the Twin Miracle; for in that both are displayed thus:
"Here the Perfect One performs the Twin Miracle, which is not shared by
disciples. He produces a mass of fire from the upper part of his body
and a shower of water from the lower part of his body *...*" (Paṭis I
125). In the case of the miracle of making unevident, only the
supernormal power is displayed, not the possessor of the supernormal
power. That can be illustrated by means of the Mahaka Sutta (S IV 200),
and the Brahmanimantanika Sutta (M I 330). For there it was only the
supernormal power of the venerable Mahaka and of the Blessed One
respectively that was displayed, not the possessors of the supernormal
power, according as it is said:



[85.] "When he had sat down at one side, the householder Citta
said to the venerable Mahaka, 'Venerable sir, it would be good if the
lord would show me a miracle of supernormal power belonging to the
higher than human state.'---



[]



[]



'Then, householder, spread your upper robe out on the terrace \[394\]
and scatter17 a bundle of hay on it.'---'Yes, venerable sir,' the
householder replied to the venerable Mahaka, and he spread out his upper
robe on the terrace and scattered a bundle of hay on it. Then the
venerable Mahaka went into his dwelling and fastened the latch, after
which he performed a feat of supernormal power such that flames came out
from the keyhole and from the gaps in the fastenings and burned the hay
without burning the upper robe" (S IV 290).



[86.] Also according as it is said: "Then, bhikkhus, I
performed a feat of supernormal power such that Brahmā and Brahmā's
retinue, and those attached to Brahmā's retinue might hear my voice and
yet not see me, and having vanished in this way, I spoke this stanza:



I saw the fear in \[all kinds of\] becoming,\
Including becoming that seeks non-becoming;\
And no becoming do I recommend;\
I cling to no delight therein at all (M I 330).



[87.] He goes unhindered through walls, through enclosures,
through mountains, as



*though in open space*: here *through walls* is beyond walls; the yonder
side of a wall, is what is meant. So with the rest. And wall is a term
for the wall of a house; enclosure is a wall surrounding a house,
monastery (park), village, etc.; *mountain* is a mountain of soil or a
mountain of stone. *Unhindered*: not sticking. *As though in open
space*: just as if he were in open space.



[88.] One who wants to go in this way should attain the
space-kasiṇa \[jhāna\] and emerge, and then do the preliminary work by
adverting to the wall or the enclosure or some such mountain as Sineru
or the World-sphere Mountains, and he should resolve, "Let there be
space." It becomes space only; it becomes hollow for him if he wants to
go down or up; it becomes cleft for him if he wants to penetrate it. He
goes through it unhindered.



[89.] But here the Elder Tipiṭaka Cūḷa-Abhaya said: "Friends,
what is the use of attaining the space-kasiṇa \[jhāna\]? Does one who
wants to create elephants, horses, etc., attain an elephant-kasiṇa jhāna
or horse-kasiṇa jhāna, and so on? Surely the only standard is mastery in
the eight attainments, and after the preliminary work has been done on
any kasiṇa, it then becomes whatever he wishes." The bhikkhus said,
"Venerable sir, only the space kasiṇa has been given in the text, so it
should certainly be mentioned."



[90.] Here is the text: "He is normally an obtainer of the
space-kasiṇa attainment. He adverts: "Through the wall, through the
enclosure, through the mountain." \[395\] Having adverted, he resolves
with knowledge: "Let there be space." There is space. He goes unhindered
through the wall, through the enclosure, through the mountain. Just as
men normally not possessed of supernormal power go unhindered where
there is no obstruction or enclosure, so too this possessor of
supernormal power, by his attaining mental mastery, goes unhindered
through



17\. *Okāseti---*"to scatter": PED, this ref., gives "to show," which
does not fit the context. Vism-mhṭ glosses with *pakirati*.



[]



[]



the wall, through the enclosure, through the mountain, as though in open
space" (Paṭis II 208).



[91.] What if a mountain or a tree is raised in this bhikkhu's
way while he is travelling along after resolving; should he attain and
resolve again?---There is no harm in that. For attaining and resolving
again is like taking the dependence (see Vin I 58; II 274) in the
preceptor's presence. And because this bhikkhu has resolved, "Let there
be space," there will be only space there, and because of the power of
his first resolve it is impossible that another mountain or tree can
have sprung up meanwhile made by temperature. However, if it has been
created by another possessor of supernormal power and created first, it
prevails; the former must go above or below it.



[92.] *He dives in and out of the ground* (*pathaviyā pi
ummujjanimmujjaṃ*): here it is rising up that is called "diving out"
(*ummujja*) and it is sinking down that is called "diving in"
(*nimmujja*).  *Ummujjanimmujjaṃ = ummujjañ ca nimmujjañ ca\
*(resolution of compound).



One who wants to do this should attain the water-kasiṇa \[jhāna\] and
emerge. Then he should do the preliminary work, determining thus, "Let
the earth in such an area be water," and he should resolve in the way
already described. Simultaneously with the resolve, that much extent of
earth according as determined becomes water only. It is there he does
the diving in and out.



[93.] Here is the text: "He is normally an obtainer of the
water-kasiṇa attainment. He adverts to earth. Having adverted, he
resolves with knowledge: "Let there be water." There is water. He does
the diving in and out of the earth. Just as men normally not possessed
of supernormal power do diving in and out of water, so this possessor of
supernormal power, by his attaining mental mastery, does the diving in
and out of the earth as though in water" (Paṭis II 208).



[94.] And he does not only dive in and out, but whatever else
he wants, such as bathing, drinking, mouth washing, washing of chattels,
and so on. And not only water, but there is whatever else (liquid that)
he wants, such as ghee, oil, honey, molasses, and so on. When he does
the preliminary work, after adverting thus, "Let there be so much of
this and this" and resolves, \[396\] it becomes as he resolved. If he
takes them and fills dishes with them, the ghee is only ghee, the oil,
etc., only oil, etc., the water only water. If he wants to be wetted by
it, he is wetted, if he does not want to be wetted by it, he is not
wetted. And it is only for him that that earth becomes water, not for
anyone else. People go on it on foot and in vehicles, etc., and they do
their ploughing, etc., there. But if he wishes, "Let it be water for
them too," it becomes water for them too. When the time determined has
elapsed, all the extent determined, except for water originally present
in water pots, ponds, etc., becomes earth again.



[95.] *On unbroken water*: here water that one sinks into when
trodden on is called "broken," the opposite is called "unbroken." But
one who wants to go in this way should attain the earth-kasiṇa \[jhāna\]
and emerge. Then he should do the preliminary work, determining thus,
"Let the water in such an area become earth," and he should resolve in
the way already described. Simultaneously with the resolve, the water in
that place becomes earth. He goes on that.



[]



[]



[96.] Here is the text: "He is normally an obtainer of the
earth-kasiṇa attainment. He adverts to water. Having adverted, he
resolves with knowledge: 'Let there be earth.' There is earth. He goes
on unbroken water. Just as men normally not possessed of supernormal
power go on unbroken earth, so this possessor of supernormal power, by
his attaining of mental mastery, goes on unbroken water as if on earth"
(Paṭis II 208).



[97.] And he not only goes, but he adopts whatever posture he
wishes. And not only earth, but whatever else \[solid that\] he wants
such as gems, gold, rocks, trees, etc. he adverts to that and resolves,
and it becomes as he resolves. And that water becomes earth only for
him; it is water for anyone else. And fishes and turtles and water birds
go about there as they like. But if he wishes to make it earth for other
people, he does so too. When the time determined has elapsed, it becomes
water again.



[98.] *Seated cross-legged he travels*: he goes seated
cross-legged. *Like a winged* *bird*: like a bird furnished with wings.
One who wants to do this should attain the earth kasiṇa and emerge.
\[397\] Then if he wants to go cross-legged, he should do the
preliminary work and determine an area the size of a seat for sitting
cross-legged on, and he should resolve in the way already described. If
he wants to go lying down, he determines an area the size of a bed. If
he wants to go on foot, he determines a suitable area the size of a
path, and he resolves in the way already described: "Let it be earth."
Simultaneously with the resolve it becomes earth.



[99.] Here is the text: "'Seated cross-legged he travels in
space like a winged bird': he is normally an obtainer of the
earth-kasiṇa attainment. He adverts to space. Having adverted, he
resolves with knowledge: 'Let there be earth.' There is earth. He
travels (walks), stands, sits, and lies down in space, in the sky. Just
as men normally not possessed of supernormal power travel (walk), stand,
sit, and lie down on earth, so this possessor of supernormal power, by
his attaining of mental mastery, travels (walks), stands, sits, and lies
down in space, in the sky" (Paṭis II 208).



[100.]And a bhikkhu who wants to travel in space should be an
obtainer of the divine eye. Why? On the way there may be mountains,
trees, etc., that are temperature-originated, or jealous nāgas,
supaṇṇas, etc., may create them. He will need to be able to see these.
But what should be done on seeing them? He should attain the basic jhāna
and emerge, and then he should do the preliminary work thus, "Let there
be space," and resolve.



[101.]But the Elder \[Tipiṭaka Cūḷa-Abhaya\] said: "Friends,
what is the use of attaining the attainment? Is not his mind
concentrated? Hence any area that he has resolved thus, 'Let it be
space' is space." Though he spoke thus, nevertheless the matter should
be treated as described under the miracle of going unhindered through
walls. Moreover, he should be an obtainer of the divine eye for the
purpose of descending in a secluded place, for if he descends in a
public place, in a bathing place, or at a village gate, he is exposed to
the multitude. So, seeing with the divine eye, he should avoid a place
where there is no open space and descend in an open space.



[]



[]



[102.]*With his hand he touches and strokes the moon and sun so
mighty and powerful*: here the "might" of the moon and sun should be
understood to consist in the fact that they travel at an altitude of
forty-two thousand leagues, and their "power" to consist in their
simultaneous illuminating of three \[of the four\] continents. \[398\]
Or they are "mighty" because they travel overhead and give light as they
do, and they are "powerful" because of that same might. *He touches*: he
seizes, or he touches in one place. *Strokes*: he strokes all over, as
if it were the surface of a looking-glass.



[103.]This supernormal power is successful simply through the
jhāna that is made the basis for direct-knowledge; there is no special
kasiṇa attainment here. For this is said in the Paṭisambhidā: "'With his
hand ... so mighty and powerful': here this possessor of supernormal
power who has attained mind mastery ... adverts to the moon and sun.
Having adverted, he resolves with knowledge: 'Let it be within hand's
reach.' It is within hand's reach. Sitting or lying down, with his hand
he touches, makes contact with, strokes the moon and sun. Just as men
normally not possessed of supernormal power touch, make contact with,
stroke, some material object within hand's reach, so this possessor of
supernormal power, by his attaining of mental mastery, sitting or lying
down, with his hands touches, makes contact with, strokes the moon and
sun" (Paṭis II 298).



[104.]If he wants to go and touch them, he goes and touches
them. But if he wants to touch them here sitting or lying down, he
resolves: "Let them be within hand's reach. Then he either touches them
as they stand within hand's reach when they have come by the power of
the resolve like palmyra fruits loosened from their stalk, or he does so
by enlarging his hand. But when he enlarges his hand, does he enlarge
what is clung to or what is not clung to? He enlarges what is not clung
to supported by what is clung to.



[105.]Here the Elder Tipiṭaka Cūḷa-Nāga said: "But, friends,
why does what is clung to not become small and big too? When a bhikkhu
comes out through a keyhole, does not what is clung to become small? And
when he makes his body big, does it not then become big, as in the case
of the Elder Mahā Moggallāna?"



[106.]At  one time, it seems, when the householder
Anāthapiṇḍika had heard the Blessed One preaching the Dhamma, he invited
him thus, Venerable sir, take alms at our house together with five
hundred bhikkhus," and then he departed. The Blessed One consented. When
the rest of that day and part of the night had passed, he surveyed the
ten-thousandfold world element in the early morning. Then the royal nāga
(serpent) called Nandopananda came within the range of his knowledge.



[107.]The Blessed One considered him thus: "This royal nāga has
come into the range of my knowledge. Has he the potentiality for
development?" Then he saw that he had wrong view and no confidence in
the Three Jewels. \[399\] He considered thus, "Who is there that can
cure him of his wrong view?" He saw that the Elder Mahā Moggallāna
could. Then when the night had turned to dawn, after he had seen to the
needs of the body, he addressed the venerable Ānanda: "Ānanda, tell five
hundred bhikkhus that the Perfect One is going on a visit to the gods."



[]



[]



[108.]It was on that day that they had got a banqueting place
ready for Nandopananda. He was sitting on a divine couch with a divine
white parasol held aloft, surrounded by the three kinds of dancers18 and
a retinue of nāgas, and surveying the various kinds of food and drink
served up in divine vessels. Then the Blessed One so acted that the
royal nāga saw him as he proceeded directly above his canopy in the
direction of the divine world of the Thirty-three, accompanied by the
five hundred bhikkhus.



[109.]Then this evil view arose in Nandopananda the royal nāga:
"There go these bald-headed monks in and out of the realm of the
Thirty-three directly over my realm. I will not have them scattering the
dirt off their feet on our heads." He got up, and he went to the foot of
Sineru. Changing his form, he surrounded it seven times with his coils.
Then he spread his hood over the realm of the Thirty- three and made
everything there invisible.



[110.]The venerable Raṭṭhapāla said to the Blessed One:
"Venerable sir, standing in this place formerly I used to see Sineru and
the ramparts of Sineru,19 and the Thirty-three, and the Vejayanta
Palace, and the flag over the Vejayanta Palace. Venerable sir, what is
the cause, what is the reason, why I now see neither Sineru nor ... the
flag over the Vejayanta Palace?"---"This royal nāga called Nandopananda
is angry with us, Raṭṭhapāla. He has surrounded Sineru seven times with
his coils, and he stands there covering us with his raised hood, making
it dark."---"I will tame him, venerable sir." But the Blessed One would
not allow it. Then the venerable Bhaddiya and the venerable Rāhula and
all the bhikkhus in turn offered to do so, but the Blessed One would not
allow it.



[111.]Last of all the venerable Mahā Moggallāna said, "I will
tame him, venerable sir." The Blessed One allowed it, saying, "Tame him,
Moggallāna." The elder abandoned that form and assumed the form of a
huge royal nāga, and he surrounded Nandopananda fourteen times with his
coils and raised his hood above the other's hood, and he squeezed him
against Sineru. The royal nāga produced smoke. \[400\] The elder said,
"There is smoke not only in your body but also in mine," and he produced
smoke. The royal nāga's smoke did not distress the elder, but the
elder's smoke distressed the royal nāga. Then the royal nāga produced
flames. The elder said, "There is fire not only in your body but also in
mine," and he produced flames. The royal nāga's fire did not distress
the elder, but the elder's fire distressed the royal nāga.



[112.] The royal nāga thought, "He has squeezed me against
Sineru, and he has produced both smoke and flames." Then he asked, "Sir,
who are you?"---"I am Moggallāna, Nanda."---"Venerable sir, resume your
proper bhikkhu's state." The elder abandoned that form, and he went into
his right ear and came out from his left ear; then he went into his left
ear and came out from his right ear. Likewise he went



18\. Vism-mhṭ (p.394): "*Vadhūkumārikaññā-vatthāhi tividhāhi
nāṭakitthīhi*."



19\. "'*The ramparts of Sineru*': the girdle of Sineru. There are, it
seems, four ramparts that encircle Sineru, measuring 5,000 leagues in
breadth and width. They were built to protect the realm of the
Thirty-three against nāgas, garudas, kumbhaṇḍas and yakkhas. They
enclose half of Sineru, it seems" (Vism-mhṭ 394).

into his right nostril and came out from his left nostril; then he went
into his left nostril and came out from his right nostril. Then the
royal nāga opened his mouth. The elder went inside it, and he walked up
and down, east and west, inside his belly.



[113.]The Blessed One said, "Moggallāna, Moggallāna, beware;
this is a mighty nāga." The elder said, "Venerable sir, the four roads
to power have been developed by me, repeatedly practiced, made the
vehicle, made the basis, established, consolidated, and properly
undertaken. I can tame not only Nandopananda, venerable sir, but a
hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand royal nāgas like Nandopananda."



[114.]The royal nāga thought, "When he went in the first place
I did not see him. But now when he comes out I shall catch him between
my fangs and chew him up." Then he said, "Venerable sir, come out. Do
not keep troubling me by walking up and down inside my belly." The elder
came out and stood outside. The royal nāga recognized him, and blew a
blast from his nose. The elder attained the fourth jhāna, and the blast
failed to move even a single hair on his body. The other bhikkhus would,
it seems, have been able to perform all the miracles up to now, but at
this point they could not have attained with so rapid a response, which
is why the Blessed One would not allow them to tame the royal nāga.



[115.] The royal nāga thought, "I have been unable to move even
a single hair on this monk's body with the blast from my nose. He is a
mighty monk." The elder abandoned that form, and having assumed the form
of a supaṇṇa, he pursued the royal nāga demonstrating the supaṇṇa's
blast. \[401\] The royal nāga abandoned that form, and having assumed
the form of a young brahman, he said, "Venerable sir, I go for refuge to
you," and he paid homage at the elder's feet. The elder said, "The
Master has come, Nanda; come, let us go to him." So having tamed the
royal nāga and deprived him of his poison, he went with him to the
Blessed One's presence.



[116.]The royal nāga paid homage to the Blessed One and said,
"Venerable sir, I go for refuge to you." The Blessed One said, "May you
be happy, royal nāga." Then he went, followed by the Community of
Bhikkhus, to Anāthapiṇḍika's house. Anāthapiṇḍika said, "Venerable sir,
why have you come so late?"---"There was a battle between Moggallāna and
Nandopananda."---"Who won, venerable sir? Who was
defeated?"---"Moggallāna won; Nanda was defeated." Anāthapiṇḍika said,
"Venerable sir, let the Blessed One consent to my providing meals for
seven days in a single series, and to my honouring the elder for seven
days." Then for seven days he accorded great honour to the five hundred
bhikkhus with the Enlightened One at their head.



[117.]So it was with reference to this enlarged form created
during this taming of Nandopananda that it was said: "When he makes his
body big, does it not then become big, as in the case of the Elder Mahā
Moggallāna?" (§105). Although this was said, the bhikkhus observed, "He
enlarges only what is not clung to supported by what is clung to." And
only this is correct here.20



20\. "Only this is correct because instances of clung-to (kammically
acquired) materiality do not arise owing to consciousness or to
temperature. Or alternatively, 'clung-to' is intended as all matter that
is bound up with faculties (i.e. 'sentient'), too. And so to

[118.]And when he has done this, he not only touches the moon
and sun, but if he wishes, he makes a footstool \[of them\] and puts his
feet on it, he makes a chair \[of them\] and sits on it, he makes a bed
\[of them\] and lies on it, he makes a leaning-plank \[of them\] and
leans on it. And as one does, so do others. For even when several
hundred thousand bhikkhus do this and each one succeeds, still the
motions of the moon and sun and their radiance remain the same. For just
as when a thousand saucers are full of water and moon disks are seen in
all the saucers, still the moon's motion is normal and so is its
radiance. And this miracle resembles that.



[119.]*Even as far as the Brahmā-world*: having made even the
Brahmā-world the limit.  *He wields bodily mastery*: herein, he wields
self-mastery in the Brahmā- world by means of the body. The meaning of
this should be understood according to the text.



Here is the text: "'He wields bodily mastery even as far as the Brahmā-
world': if this possessor of supernormal power, having reached mental
mastery, wants to go to the Brahmā-world, though far, he resolves upon
nearness, 'Let it be near.' \[402\] It is near. Though near, he resolves
upon farness, 'Let it be far.' It is far. Though many, he resolves upon
few, 'Let there be few.' There are few. Though few, he resolves upon
many, 'Let there be many.' There are many. With the divine eye he sees
the \[fine-material\] visible form of that Brahmā. With the divine ear
element he hears the voice of that Brahmā. With the knowledge of
penetration of minds he understands that Brahmā's mind. If this
possessor of supernormal power, having reached mental mastery, wants to
go to the Brahmā- world with a visible body, he converts his mind to
accord with his body, he resolves his mind to accord with his body.
Having converted his mind to accord with his body, resolved his mind to
accord with his body, he arrives at blissful (easy) perception and light
(quick) perception, and he goes to the Brahmā- world with a visible
body. If this possessor of supernormal power, having reached mental
mastery, wants to go to the Brahmā-world with an invisible body, he
converts his body to accord with his mind, he resolves his body to
accord with his mind. Having converted his body to accord with his mind,
resolved his body to accord with his mind, he arrives at blissful (easy)
perception and light (quick) perception, and he goes to the Brahmā-world
with an invisible body. He creates a \[fine-material\] visible form
before that Brahmā, mind-made with all its limbs, lacking no faculty. If
that possessor of supernormal power walks up and down,



take it as enlargement of that is likewise not correct. Consequently,
enlargement should be understood only in the way stated. Though the
clung-to and the unclung-to occur, as it were, mixed up in a single
continuity, they are nevertheless not mixed up in meaning. Herein, just
as when a pint measure (*āḷhaka*) of milk is poured into a number of
pints of water, though the milk becomes completely mixed up with the
water, and is present appreciably in all, it is nevertheless not the
milk that has increased there, but only the water. And so too, although
the clung-to and unclung-to occur mixed up together, it is nevertheless
not the clung-to that is enlarged. It should be taken that it is the
consciousness-born matter that is enlarged by the influence of the
supernormal power, and the temperature-born is enlarged *pari passu*"
(Vism-mhṭ 395).



[]



[]



the creation walks up and down there too. If that possessor of
supernormal power stands ... sits ... lies down, the creation lies down
there too. If that possessor of supernormal power produces smoke ...
produces flames ... preaches Dhamma ... asks a question ... being asked
a question, answers, the creation, being asked a question, answers there
too. If that possessor of supernormal power stands with that Brahmā,
converses, enters into communication with that Brahmā, the creation
stands with that Brahmā there too, converses, enters into communication
with that Brahmā there too. Whatever that possessor of supernormal power
does, the creation does the same thing'" (Paṭis II 209).



[120.]Herein, *though far, he resolves upon nearness*: having
emerged from the basic jhāna, he adverts to a far-off world of the gods
or to the Brahmā-world thus, "Let it be near." Having adverted and done
the preliminary work, he attains again, and then resolves with
knowledge: "Let it be near." It becomes near. The same method of
explanation applies to the other clauses too.



[121.]Herein, who has taken what was far and made it near? The
Blessed One. For when the Blessed One was going to the divine world
after the Twin Miracle, he made Yugandhara and Sineru near, and from the
earth's surface he set one foot \[403\] on Yugandhara, and then he set
the other on the summit of Sineru.



[122.]Who else has done it? The Elder Mahā Moggallāna. For when
the elder was leaving Sāvatthī after completing his meal, he abridged
the twelve-league crowd and the thirty-league road to the city of
Saṅkassa, and he arrived at the same moment.



[123.]Furthermore, the Elder Cūḷa Samudda did it as well in
Tambapaṇṇi Island. During a time of scarcity, it seems, seven hundred
bhikkhus came to the elder one morning. The elder thought, "Where can a
large community of bhikkhus wander for alms?" He saw nowhere at all in
Tambapaṇṇi Island, but he saw that it would be possible on the other
shore at Pāṭaliputta (Patna). He got the bhikkhus to take their bowls
and \[outer\] robes, and he said, "Come friends, let us go wandering for
alms." Then he abridged the earth and went to Pāṭaliputta. The bhikkhus
asked, "What is the city, venerable sir?"---"It is Pāṭaliputta,
friends."--- "Pāṭaliputta is far away, venerable sir."---"Friends,
experienced elders make what is far near."---"Where is the ocean
(*mahā-samudda*), venerable sir?"---"Friends, did you not cross a blue
stream on the way as you came?"---"Yes, venerable sir, but the ocean is
vast."---"Friends, experienced elders also make what is vast small."



[124.]And the Elder Tissadatta did likewise, when he had put on
his upper robes after bathing in the evening, and the thought of paying
homage at the Great Enlightenment Tree arose in him.



[125.]Who has taken what was near and made it far? The Blessed
One. For although Aṅgulimāla was near to the Blessed One, yet he made
him far (see M II 99).



[126.]Who has made much little? The Elder Mahā Kassapa. One
feast day at Rājagaha, it seems, there were five hundred girls on their
way to enjoy the festival, and they had taken moon cakes with them. They
saw the Blessed One but gave



[]



[]



him nothing. On their way back, however, they saw the elder. Thinking,
"He is our elder," they each took a cake and approached the elder. The
elder took out his bowl and made a single bowlful of them all. The
Blessed One had sat down first to await the elder. The elder brought
them and gave them to the Blessed One.



[127.]In the story of the rich man Illīsa, however, (J-a I 348;
Dhp-a I 372) the Elder Mahā Moggallāna made little much. And in the
story of Kākavaḷiya the Blessed One did so. The Elder Mahā Kassapa, it
seems, after spending seven days in attainment, stood at the house door
of a man in poor circumstances called Kākavaḷiya in order to show favour
to the poor. \[404\] His wife saw the elder, and she poured into his
bowl the unsalted sour gruel that she had cooked for her husband. The
elder took it and placed it in the Blessed One's hand. The Blessed One
resolved to make it enough for the Greater Community of Bhikkhus. What
was brought in a single bowl became enough for all. And on the seventh
day Kākavaḷiya became a rich man.



[128.]And not only in the case of making little much, but
whatever the possessor of supernormal power wishes, whether to make the
sweet unsweet, etc., it is successful for him. For so it was that when
the Elder Mahā Anula saw many bhikkhus sitting on the banks of the Gaṅgā
River \[in Sri Lanka\] eating plain rice, which was all that they had
got after doing their alms round, he resolved, "Let the Gaṅgā River
water be cream of ghee," and he gave a sign to the novices. They fetched
it in their vessels and gave it to the Community of Bhikkhus. All of
them ate their meal with sweet cream of ghee.



[129.]*With the divine eye*: remaining here and extending
light, he sees the visible form of that Brahmā. And remaining here he
also hears the sound of his speech and he understands his mind.



[130.]*He converts his mind according to his body*: he converts
the mind to accord with the material body; taking the consciousness of
the basic jhāna, he mounts it upon the body, he makes its going slow to
coincide with that of the body; for the body's mode of going is slow.



[131.]*He arrives at blissful perception and light perception*:
he arrives at, enters, makes contact with, reaches, the perception of
bliss and perception of lightness that are conascent with the
consciousness whose object is the basic jhāna. And it is perception
associated with equanimity that is called "perception of bliss"; for
equanimity is called "bliss" since it is peaceful. And that same
perception should be understood to be called "perception of lightness"
too because it is liberated from hindrances and from the things that
oppose it beginning with applied thought. But when he arrives at that
state, his physical body too becomes as light as a tuft of cotton. He
goes to the Brahmā-world thus with a visible body as light as a tuft of
cotton wafted by the wind.



[132.]As he goes thus, if he wishes, he creates a path in space
by means of the earth kasiṇa and goes on foot. If he wishes, he resolves
by means of the air kasiṇa that there shall be air, and he goes by air
like a tuft of cotton. Moreover, the desire to go is the measure here.
When there is the desire to go, one who has made his mental resolve in
this way goes visibly, carried by the force of the resolution like an
arrow shot by an archer. \[405\]



[]



[]



[133.]*He converts his body to accord with his mind*: he takes
the body and mounts it on the mind. He makes its going swift to coincide
with that of the mind; for the mind's mode of going is swift.



*He arrives at blissful perception and light perception*: he arrives at
perception of bliss and perception of lightness that are conascent with
the supernormal- power consciousness whose object is the material body.
The rest should be understood in the way already described. But here
there is only the going of consciousness.21



[134.]When it was asked, "As he goes with an invisible body
thus, does he go at the moment of the resolution-consciousness's arising
or at the moment of its presence or at the moment of its dissolution?",
an elder replied, "He goes in all three moments."---"But does he go
himself, or does he send a creation?"---"He does as he pleases. But here
it is only the going himself that has been given \[in the text\]."



[135.]*Mind-made*: mind-made because created by the mind in
resolution. *Lacking no faculty*: this refers to the shape of the eye,
ear, etc.; but there is no sensitivity in



21\. "'*There is only the going of consciousness*': there is only a
going that is the same as that of the mind. But how does the body, whose
going \[being that of matter\] is slow, come to have the same going as
the mind, which quickly passes? Its going is not the same in all
respects; for in the case of converting the mind to conform with the
body, the mind does not come to have the same going as the body in all
respects. For it is not that the mind then occurs with the moment of a
material state, which passes slowly, instead of passing with its own
kind of moment, which is what establishes its individual essence. But
rather the mind is called 'converted to accord with the going of the
body' as long as it goes on occurring in a continuity that conforms with
the body until the desired place is arrived at. This is because its
passing occurs parallel with that of the body, whose going is slow,
owing to the resolution, 'Let the mind be like this body.' And likewise,
it is while the body keeps occurring in suchwise that its arrival at the
desired place comes about in only a few quick passes of the mind instead
of passing slowly, as in those who have not developed the roads to
power---and this mode of occurrence is due to the possession of the
perception of lightness, to say nothing of the resolve, 'Let this body
be like this mind'---that the body is called 'converted to accord with
the going of the mind,' not because it arrives at the desired place in a
single consciousness moment. And when taken thus the simile, 'Just as a
strong man might stretch out his bent arm, or bend his outstretched arm'
(Vin I 5) can be taken literally. And this must be accepted in this way
without reserve, otherwise there is conflict with the Suttas, the
Abhidhamma and the Commentary, as well as contradiction of natural law
(*dhammatā*). 'Bhikkhus, I see no other one thing that is so quickly
transformed as the mind' (A I 10)---here it is material states that are
referred to by the word 'other' because they do not pass quickly. And in
the Abhidhamma only matter is called prenascence condition and only
consciousness postnascence condition. And wherever states (*dhamma*)
arise, there they dissolve. There is no transmigration to an adjacent
location (*desantara-saṅkamana*), nor does the individual essence become
other. For it is not possible to effect any alteration of the
characteristics of dhammas by force of the roads to power. But it is
possible to effect alteration of the mode in which they are present
(*bhāva*)" (Vism-mhṭ 397).



[]



[]



a created visible form.22 *If the possessor of supernormal power walks
up and down, the creation walks up and down there too*, etc., all refers
to what a disciple creates; but what the Blessed One creates does
whatever the Blessed One does, and it also does other things according
to the Blessed One's pleasure.



[136.]When this possessor of supernormal power, while remaining
here sees a visible object with the divine eye, hears a sound with the
divine ear element, knows consciousness with the penetration of minds,
he does not wield bodily power in doing that. And when, while remaining
here, he stands with that Brahmā, converses, enters into communication
with that Brahmā, he does not wield bodily power in doing that. And when
he makes his resolve described in the way beginning "though far, he
resolves upon nearness," he does not wield bodily power in doing that.
And when he goes to the Brahmā-world with a visible or an invisible
body, he does not wield bodily power in doing that. But when he enters
upon the process described in the way beginning, "He creates a visible
form before that Brahmā, mind-made," then he wields bodily power in
doing that. The rest, however, is said here for the purpose of showing
the stage prior to the wielding of the bodily power. This, firstly, is
(i) success by resolve (§45).



[137.]The difference between (i) success as transformation and
(ii) success as the mind-made \[body\], is as follows (see §22, 24, 25,
45).



[(i)] One, firstly, who performs a transformation \[406\]
should resolve upon whatever he chooses from among the things beginning
with the appearance of a boy, described as follows: "He abandons his
normal appearance and shows the appearance of a boy or the appearance of
a nāga (serpent), or the appearance of a supaṇṇa (winged demon), or the
appearance of an asura (demon), or the appearance of the Ruler \[of
Gods\] (Indra), or the appearance of some \[other sensual-sphere\]
deity, or the appearance of a Brahmā, or the appearance of the sea, or
the appearance of a rock, or the appearance of a lion, or the appearance
of a tiger, or the appearance of a leopard, or he shows an elephant, or
he shows a horse, or he shows a chariot, or he shows a foot soldier, or
he shows a manifold military array" (Paṭis II 210).



[138.]And when he resolves he should emerge from the fourth
jhāna that is the basis for direct-knowledge and has one of the things
beginning with the earth kasiṇa as its object, and he should advert to
his own appearance as a boy. After adverting and finishing the
preliminary work, he should attain again and emerge, and he should
resolve thus: "Let me be a boy of such and such a type." Simultaneously
with the resolve consciousness he becomes the boy, just as Devadatta did
(Vin I 185; Dhp-a I 139). This is the method in all instances. But *he
shows an elephant*, etc., is said here with respect to showing an
elephant, etc., externally. Herein, instead of resolving, "Let me be an
elephant," he resolves, "Let there be an elephant." The same method
applies in the case of the horse and the rest.



22\. "This should be regarded as implying that there is no sex or life
faculty in it either." (Vism-mhṭ 398).



[]



[]



This is success as transformation.



[139.](ii) One who wants to make the mind-made \[body\] should
emerge from the basic jhāna and first advert to the body in the way
already described, and then he should resolve, "Let it be hollow." It
becomes hollow. Then he adverts to another body inside it, and having
done the preliminary work in the way already described, he resolves,
"Let there be another body inside it." Then he draws it out like a reed
from its sheath, like a sword from its scabbard, like a snake from its
slough. Hence it is said: "Here a bhikkhu creates from this body another
body possessing visible form, mind-made, with all its limbs, lacking no
faculty. Just as though a man pulled out a reed from its sheath and
thought thus: 'This is the sheath; this is the reed; the sheath is one,
the reed is another, it was from the sheath that the reed was pulled
out'" (Paṭis II 210), and so on. And here, just as the reed, etc., are
similar to the sheath, etc., so too the mind-made visible form is
similar to the possessor of supernormal power, and this simile is given
in order to show that.



This is success as the mind-made \[body\].

## CHAPTER XIII 


OTHER DIRECT-KNOWLEDGES



(*Abhiññā-niddesa*)



\[(2) THE DIVINE EAR ELEMENT\]



[1.]\[407\] It is now the turn for the description of the
divine ear element. Herein, and also in the case of the remaining three
kinds of direct-knowledge, the meaning of the passage beginning, "When
his concentrated mind ..." (D I 79) should be understood in the way
already stated (XII.13f.); and in each case we shall only comment on
what is different. \[The text is as follows: "He directs, he inclines,
his mind to the divine ear element. With the divine ear element, which
is purified and surpasses the human, he hears both kinds of sounds, the
divine and the human, those that are far as well as near"(D I 79).\]



[2.]Herein, *with the divine ear element*: it is *divine* here
because of its similarity to the divine; for deities have as the divine
ear element the sensitivity that is produced by kamma consisting in good
conduct and is unimpeded by bile, phlegm, blood, etc., and capable of
receiving an object even though far off because it is liberated from
imperfections. And this ear element consisting in knowledge, which is
produced by the power of this bhikkhu's energy in development, is
similar to that, so it is "divine" because it is similar to the divine.
Furthermore, it is "divine" because it is obtained by means of divine
abiding and because it has divine abiding as its support. And it is an
"ear element" (*sota-dhātu*) in the sense of hearing (*savana*) and in
the sense of being a soulless \[element\]. Also it is an "ear element"
because it is like the ear element in its performance of an ear
element's function. With that divine ear element ... he hears ...



*Which is purified*: which is quite pure through having no imperfection.
*And* *surpasses the human*: which in the hearing of sounds surpasses,
stands beyond, the human ear element by surpassing the human
environment.



[3.]*He hears both kinds of sounds*: he hears the two kinds of
sounds. What two? The divine and the human: the sounds of deities and of
human beings, is what is meant. This should be understood as partially
inclusive. *Those that are far as well as near*: what is meant is that
he hears sounds that are far off, even in another world-sphere, and
those that are near, even the sounds of the creatures living in his own
body. This should be understood as completely inclusive.



[4.] But how is this \[divine ear element\] aroused? The
bhikkhu \[408\] should



attain jhāna as basis for direct-knowledge and emerge. Then, with the


[]



[]



consciousness belonging to the preliminary-work concentration,1 he
should advert first to the gross sounds in the distance normally within
range of hearing: the sound in the forest of lions, etc., or in the
monastery the sound of a gong, the sound of a drum, the sound of a
conch, the sound of recitation by novices and young bhikkhus reciting
with full vigour, the sound of their ordinary talk such as "What,
venerable sir?", "What, friend?", etc., the sound of birds, the sound of
wind, the sound of footsteps, the fizzing sound of boiling water, the
sound of palm leaves drying in the sun, the sound of ants, and so on.
Beginning in this way with quite gross sounds, he should successively
advert to more and more subtle sounds. He should give attention to the
sound sign of the sounds in the eastern direction, in the western
direction, in the northern direction, in the southern direction, in the
upper direction, in the lower direction, in the eastern intermediate
direction, in the western intermediate direction, in the northern
intermediate direction, and in the southern intermediate direction. He
should give attention to the sound sign of gross and of subtle sounds.2



[5.] These sounds are evident even to his normal consciousness;
but they are especially evident to his preliminary-work-concentration
consciousness. 3 As he gives his attention to the sound sign in this
way, \[thinking\] "Now the divine ear element will arise," mind-door
adverting arises making one of these sounds its object. When that has
ceased, then either four or five impulsions impel, the first three, or
four, of which are of the sense sphere and are called preliminary- work,
access, conformity, and change-of-lineage, while the fourth, or the
fifth, is fine-material-sphere absorption consciousness belonging to the
fourth jhāna.



[6.] Herein, it is knowledge arisen together with the
absorption consciousness that is called the divine ear element. After
that \[absorption has been reached, the divine ear element\] becomes
merged in that ear \[of knowledge\].4 When consolidating it, he should
extend it by delimiting a single finger-breadth thus, "I will hear
sounds within this area," then two finger-breadths, four finger-
breadths, eight finger-breadths, a span, a *ratana* (= 24
finger-breadths), the interior



1\. "With the consciousness belonging to the particular concentration
that constitutes the preliminary work. The meaning is: by means of
consciousness concentrated with the momentary concentration that occurs
in the form of the preliminary work for knowledge of the divine ear
element. The occasion of access for the divine ear element is called
preliminary-work consciousness, but that as stated refers to multiple
advertings" (Vism-mhṭ 401).\



2\. "The sound sign is the sound itself since it is the cause for the
arising of the knowledge. Or the gross-subtle aspect acquired in the way
stated is the sound sign" (Vism-mhṭ 402).\



3\. "This is momentary-concentration consciousness, which owing to the
fact that the preliminary work contingent upon the sound has been
performed, occurs in one who has attained the basic jhāna and emerged
for the purpose of arousing the divine ear element" (Vism-mhṭ 402).\



4\. "'*Becomes merged*' is amalgamated with the divine ear element. He
is called an obtainer of divine-ear knowledge as soon as the absorption
consciousness has arisen. The meaning is that there is now no further
need of development for the purpose" (Vism-mhṭ 403).



[]



[]



of the room, the veranda, the building, the surrounding walk, the park
belonging to the community, the alms-resort village, the district, and
so on up to the \[limit of the\] world-sphere, or even more. This is how
he should extend it by delimited stages.



[7.]One who has reached direct-knowledge in this way hears also
by means of direct-knowledge without re-entering the basic jhāna any
sound that has come within the space touched by the basic jhāna's
object. And in hearing in this way, even if there is an uproar with
sounds of conches, drums, cymbals, etc., right up to the Brahmā-world
\[409\] he can, if he wants to, still define each one thus, "This is the
sound of conches, this is the sound of drums."



The explanation of the divine ear element is ended.



\[(3) PENETRATION OF MINDS\]



[8.]As to the explanation of knowledge of penetration of minds,
\[the text is as follows: "He directs, he inclines, his mind to the
knowledge of penetration of minds. He penetrates with his mind the minds
of other beings, of other persons, and understands them thus: he
understands \[the manner of\] consciousness affected by greed as
affected by greed, and understands \[the manner of\] consciousness
unaffected by greed as unaffected by greed; he understands consciousness
affected by hate as affected by hate, and consciousness unaffected by
hate as unaffected by hate; he understands consciousness affected by
delusion as affected by delusion, and consciousness unaffected by
delusion as unaffected by delusion; he understands cramped consciousness
as cramped, and distracted consciousness as distracted; he understands
exalted consciousness as exalted, and unexalted consciousness as
unexalted; he understands surpassed consciousness as surpassed and
unsurpassed consciousness as unsurpassed; he understands concentrated
consciousness as concentrated and unconcentrated consciousness as
unconcentrated; he understands the liberated \[manner of\] consciousness
as liberated, and the unliberated \[manner of\] consciousness as
unliberated" (D I 79). Here, it goes all round (*pariyāti*), thus it is
penetration (*pariya*); the meaning is that it delimits
(*paricchindati*). The penetration of the heart (*cetaso pariyaṃ*) is
"penetration of minds" (*cetopariya*). It is penetration of hearts and
that is knowledge, thus it is knowledge of penetration of minds
(*cetopariyañāṇa*). \[He directs his consciousness\] to that, is what is
meant.



*Of other beings*: of the rest of beings, himself excluded. *Of other
persons*: this has the same meaning as the last, the wording being
varied to suit those susceptible of teaching \[in another way\], and for
the sake of elegance of exposition. *With his mind the minds*: with his
\[manner of\] consciousness the \[manner of\] consciousness of other
beings. *Having penetrated*  (*paricca*): having delimited all round.
*He understands*: he understands them to be of various sorts beginning
with that affected by greed.



[9.]But how is this knowledge to be aroused? That is
successfully done through the divine eye, which constitutes its
preliminary work. Therefore the bhikkhu should extend light, and he
should seek out (*pariyesitabba*) another's \[manner of\] consciousness
by keeping under observation with the divine eye the colour



[]



[]



of the blood present with the matter of the physical heart as its
support.5 For when \[a manner of\] consciousness accompanied by joy is
present, the blood is red like a banyan-fig fruit; when \[a manner of\]
consciousness accompanied by grief is present, it is blackish like a
rose-apple fruit; when \[a manner of\] consciousness accompanied by
serenity is present, it is clear like sesame oil. So he should seek out
another's \[manner of\] consciousness by keeping under observation the
colour of the blood in the physical heart thus, "This matter is
originated by the joy faculty; this is originated by the grief faculty;
this is originated by the equanimity faculty," and so consolidate his
knowledge of penetration of hearts.



[10.]It is when it has been consolidated in this way that he
can gradually get to understand not only all manner of sense-sphere
consciousness but those of fine-material and immaterial consciousness as
well by tracing one \[manner of\] consciousness from another without any
more seeing the physical heart's matter. For this is said in the
Commentary: "When he wants to know another's \[manner of\] consciousness
in the immaterial modes, whose physical-heart matter can he observe?
Whose material alteration \[originated\] by the faculties can he look
at? No one's. The province of a possessor of supernormal power is
\[simply\] this, namely, wherever the \[manner of\] consciousness he
adverts to is, there he knows it according to these sixteen classes."
But this explanation \[by means of the physical heart\] is for one who
has not \[yet\] done any interpreting.6



[11.] As regards \[*the manner of*\]  *consciousness affected
by greed*, etc., the eight \[manners of\] consciousness accompanied by
greed (see Table III, nos. (22)--(29)) \[410\] should be understood as
\[*the manner of*\] consciousness affected by greed. The remaining
profitable and indeterminate \[manners of\] consciousness in the four
planes are *unaffected by greed*. The four, namely, the two
consciousnesses accompanied by grief (nos. (30) and (31)), and the two
consciousnesses \[accompanied respectively by\] uncertainty (32) and
agitation (33) are not included in this dyad, though some elders include
them too. It is the two consciousnesses accompanied by grief that are
called *consciousness affected by hate*. And all profitable and
indeterminate consciousnesses in the four planes are unaffected by hate.
The remaining ten kinds of unprofitable consciousnesses (nos. (22)--(29)
and (32) and (33)) are not included in this dyad, though some elders
include them too. *Affected by delusion* ...  *unaffected by delusion*:
here only the two, namely, that accompanied by uncertainty and that
accompanied by agitation, are affected by delusion alone \[without being
accompanied by the other two unprofitable roots\]. But \[all\] the
twelve kinds of unprofitable consciousnesses (nos. (22)--(33)) can also
be understood as \[the manner of\]



5\. The "matter of the heart" is not the heart-basis, but rather it is
the heart as the piece of flesh described as resembling a lotus bud in
shape outside and like a *kosātakī* fruit inside (VIII.111). For the
blood mentioned here is to be found with that as its support. But the
heart-basis occurs with this blood as its support" (Vism-mhṭ 403).



6\. "Of one who has not done any interpreting (*abhinivesa*) reckoned as
study for direct-knowledge" (Vism-mhṭ 407). A rather special use of the
word *abhinivesa*, perhaps more freely renderable here as "practice."

consciousness affected by delusion since delusion is present in all
kinds of unprofitable consciousnesses. The rest are *unaffected by
delusion*.



[12.]*Cramped* is that attended by stiffness and torpor.
Distracted is that attended by agitation. *Exalted* is that of the
fine-material and immaterial spheres. *Unexalted* is the rest.
*Surpassed* is all that in the three \[mundane\] planes. *Unsurpassed*
is the supramundane.  *Concentrated* is that attained to access and that
attained to absorption. *Unconcentrated* is that not attained to either.
*Liberated* is that attained to any \[of the five kinds of\]
deliverance, that is to say, deliverance by substitution of opposites
\[through insight\], by suppression \[through concentration\], by
cutting off \[by means of the path\], by tranquillization \[by means of
fruition\], and by renunciation \[as Nibbāna\] (see Paṭis I 26 under
"abandoning"). *Unliberated* is that which has not attained to any of
the five kinds of liberation.



So the bhikkhu who has acquired the knowledge of penetration of hearts
understands all these \[manners of consciousness, namely, the manner
of\] consciousness affected by greed as affected by greed ... \[the
unliberated manner of\] consciousness as unliberated.



\[(4) RECOLLECTION OF PAST LIVES\]



[13.]As to the explanation of knowledge of recollection of past
lives, \[the text is as follows:\] He directs, he inclines, his mind to
the knowledge of recollection of past lives. He recollects his manifold
past lives, that is to say, one birth, two births, three births, four
births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty
births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred
thousand births, many eons of world contraction, many eons of world
expansion: many eons of world contraction and expansion: "There I was so
named, of such a race, with such an appearance, such was my food, such
my experience of pleasure and pain, such the end of my life span; and
passing away from there, I reappeared elsewhere; and there too I was so
named, of such a race, with such an appearance, such was my food, such
my experience of pleasure and pain, such the end of my life span; and
passing away from there, I reappeared here." Thus with its aspects and
particulars he recollects his manifold past lives" (D I 81). \[Herein,\]
to *the knowledge of recollection of past lives* \[means\] for knowledge
concerning recollection of past lives. *Past lives* is aggregates lived
in the past in former births. "Lived" \[in that case means\] lived out,
undergone, arisen and ceased in one's own \[subjective\] continuity. Or
alternatively, \[past lives\] is mental objects lived \[in the past in
one's former births\]; and "lived" in that case means lived by living in
one's \[objective\] resort, which has been cognized and delimited by
one's own consciousness, or cognized by another's consciousness, too. In
the case of recollection of those \[past Enlightened Ones\] who have
broken the cycle, and so on,7 these last are only accessible to
Enlightened Ones. *Recollection of past lives*: the mindfulness (memory)
by means of which he recollects the past lives is the recollection of
past lives. Knowledge is the knowledge associated with that mindfulness.
\[411\] *To the knowledge of recollection of past lives*: for the
purpose of



7\. For the term *chinna-vaṭumaka* ("one who has broken the cycle of
rebirths") as an epithet of former Buddhas, see M III 118.



[]



[]



the knowledge of the recollection of past lives in this way; for the
attaining, for the reaching, of that knowledge, is what is meant.



[14.] *Manifold*: of many kinds: or that has occurred in many
ways. Given in detail, is the meaning.8  *Past lives* is the continuity
lived here and there, taking the immediately previous existence as the
beginning \[and working backwards\]. *He recollects*: he recalls it,
following it out by the succession of aggregates, or by death and
rebirth-linking.



[15.]There are six kinds of people who recollect these past
lives. They are: other sectarians, ordinary disciples, great disciples,
chief disciples, Paccekabuddhas, and Buddhas.



[16.] Herein, other sectarians recollect only as far back as
forty eons, but not beyond that. Why? Because their understanding is
weak for lack of delimitation of mind and matter (see Ch. XVIII).
Ordinary disciples recollect as far back as a hundred eons and as far
back as a thousand eons because their understanding is strong. The
eighty great disciples recollect as far back as a hundred thousand eons.
The two chief disciples recollect as far back as an incalculable age and
a hundred thousand eons. Paccekabuddhas recollect as far back as two
incalculable ages and a hundred thousand eons. For such is the extent to
which they can convey \[their minds back respectively\]. But there is no
limit in the case of Buddhas.



[17.] Again, other sectarians only recollect the succession of
aggregates; they are unable to recollect according \[only\] to death and
rebirth-linking, letting go of the succession of aggregates. They are
like the blind in that they are unable to descend upon any place they
choose; they go as the blind do without letting go of their sticks. So
they recollect without letting go of the succession of aggregates.
Ordinary disciples both recollect by means of the succession of
aggregates and trace by means of death and rebirth-linking. Likewise,
the eighty great disciples. But the chief disciples have nothing to do
with the succession of aggregates. When they see the death of one
person, they see the rebirth-linking, and again when they see the death
of another, they see the rebirth-linking. So they go by tracing through
death and rebirth-thinking. Likewise, Paccekabuddhas.



[18.]Buddhas, however, have nothing to do either with
succession of aggregates or with tracing through death and
rebirth-linking; for whatever instance they choose in many millions of
eons, or more or less, is evident to them. So they go, and so they
descend with the lion's descent9 wherever they want, even skipping over
many millions of eons as though they were an elision in a text. And just
as an arrow shot by such a master of archery expert in hair-splitting as
Sarabhaṅga (see J-a V 129) always hits the target without getting held
up among trees, creepers, etc., on its way, and so neither gets held up
nor misses, so too, since Buddhas go in this way their knowledge does
not get held up in intermediate



8\. *Saṃvaṇṇita---*"given in detail"; Vism-mhṭ glosses by *vitthāritan
ti attho*. Not in this meaning in PED. See prologue verses to the four
Nikāyas.\



9\. A commentarial account of the behaviour of lions will be found in
the *Manorathapurāṇī*, commentary to AN 4:33. Vism-mhṭ says:
*Sīh-okkamana-vasena sīhātipatanavasena ñāṇagatiyā* *gacchati* (p. 408).



[]



[]



births \[412\] or miss; without getting held up or missing, it seizes
any instance required.



[19.] Among these beings with recollection of past lives, the
sectarians' vision of past lives seems like the light of a glow-worm,
that of ordinary disciples like the light of a candle, that of the great
disciples like the light of a torch, that of the chief disciples like
the light of the morning star, that of Paccekabuddhas like the light of
the moon, and that of Buddhas like the glorious autumn sun's disk with
its thousand rays.



[20.]Other sectarians see past lives as blind men go
\[tapping\] with the point of a stick. Ordinary disciples do so as men
who go on a log bridge. The great disciples do so as men who go on a
foot bridge. The chief disciples do so as men who go on a cart bridge.
Paccekabuddhas do so as men who go on a main foot- path. And Buddhas do
so as men who go on a high road for carts.



[21.]In this connection it is the disciples' recollection of
past lives that is intended. Hence it was said above: "'He recollects':
he recollects it following it out by the succession of aggregates, or by
death and rebirth-linking" (§14).



[22.]So a bhikkhu who is a beginner and wants to recollect in
this way should go into solitary retreat on return from his alms round
after his meal. Then he should attain the four jhānas in succession and
emerge from the fourth jhāna as basis for direct-knowledge. He should
then advert to his most recent act of sitting down \[for this purpose\],
next, to the preparation of the seat, to the entry into the lodging, to
the putting away of the bowl and \[outer\] robe, to the time of eating,
to the time of returning from the village, to the time of wandering for
alms in the village, to the time of entering the village, to the time of
setting out from the monastery, to the time of paying homage at the
shrine terrace and the Enlightenment-tree terrace, to the time of
washing the bowl, to the time of picking up the bowl, to the things done
from the time of picking up the bowl back to the mouth washing, to the
things done in the early morning, to the things done in the middle
watch, in the first watch. In this way he should advert to all the
things done during the whole night and day in reverse order.



[23.]While this much, however, is evident even to his normal
consciousness, it is especially evident to his preliminary-work
consciousness. But if anything there is not evident, he should again
attain the basic jhāna, emerge and advert. By so doing it becomes as
evident as when a lamp is lit. And so, in reverse order too, he should
advert to the things done on the second day back, and on the third,
fourth and fifth day, and in the ten days, and in the fortnight, and as
far back as a year.



[24.]When by these means he adverts to ten years, twenty years,
and so on as far back as his own rebirth-linking in this existence,
\[413\] he should advert to the mentality-materiality occurring at the
moment of death in the preceding existence; for a wise bhikkhu is able
at the first attempt to remove10 the rebirth-linking and make the
mentality-materiality at the death moment his object.



10\. *Ugghaṭetvā*: see X.6; the word is obviously used here in the same
sense.



[]



[]



[25.]But the mentality-materiality in the previous existence
has ceased without remainder and another has arisen, and consequently
that instance is, as it were, shut away in darkness, and it is hard for
one of little understanding to see it. Still he should not give up the
task, thinking, "I am unable to remove the rebirth- linking and make the
mentality-materiality that occurred at the death moment my object." On
the contrary, he should again and again attain that same basic jhāna,
and each time he emerges he should advert to that instance.



[26.]Just as when a strong man is felling a big tree for the
purpose of making the peak of a gable, but is unable to fell the big
tree with an axe blade blunted by lopping the branches and foliage,
still he does not give up the task; on the contrary, he goes to a smithy
and has his axe sharpened, after which he returns and continues chopping
the tree; and when the axe again gets blunt, he does as before and
continues chopping it; and as he goes on chopping it in this way, the
tree falls at length, because each time there is no need to chop again
what has already been chopped and what has not yet been chopped gets
chopped; so too, when he emerges from the basic jhāna, instead of
adverting to what he has already adverted to, he should advert only to
the rebirth-linking, and at length he removes the rebirth-linking and
makes the mentality-materiality that occurred at the death moment his
object. And this meaning should also be illustrated by means of the wood
cutter and the hair-cutter as well.



[27.] Herein, the knowledge that occurs making its object the
period from the last sitting down for this purpose back to the
rebirth-linking is not called knowledge of recollection of past lives;
but it is called preliminary-work- concentration knowledge; and some
call it "knowledge of the past" (*atītaṃsa- ñāṇa*), but that is
inappropriate to the fine-material sphere.



However, when this bhikkhu has got back beyond the rebirth-linking,
there arises in him mind-door adverting making its object the
mentality-materiality that occurred at the death moment. And when that
has ceased, then either four or five impulsions impel making that their
object too. The first of these, called "preliminary-work," etc., in the
way already described (§5), are of the sense sphere. The last is a
fine-material absorption consciousness of the fourth jhāna. The
knowledge that arises in him then together with that consciousness is
what is called, "knowledge of recollection of past lives." It is with
the mindfulness (memory) associated with that knowledge that he
"recollects his manifold past lives, that is to say, one birth, two
births, ..."\[414\] thus with details and particulars he recollects his
manifold past lives (D I 81).



[28.] Herein,  *one birth* is the continuity of aggregates
included in a single becoming starting with rebirth-linking and ending
with death. So too with two births, and the rest.



But in the case of *many eons of world contraction*, etc., it should be
understood that the aeon of world contraction is an aeon of diminution
and the aeon of world expansion is an aeon of increase.



[29.] Herein, what supersedes the contraction is included in
the contraction since it is rooted in it; and so too what supersedes the
expansion is included in the expansion. This being so, it includes what
is stated thus: "Bhikkhus, there



[]



[]



are four incalculables of the aeon. What four? The contraction, what
supersedes the contraction, the expansion, and what supersedes the
expansion" (A II 142 abbreviated).



[30.] Herein, there are three kinds of contraction: contraction
due to water, contraction due to fire, and contraction due to air (see
MN 28). Also there are three limits to the contraction; the Ābhassara
(Streaming-radiance) Brahmā- world, that of the Subhakiṇha
(Refulgent-glory), and that of the Vehapphala (Great-fruit). When the
aeon contracts owing to fire, all below the Ābhassara \[Brahmā-world\]
is burnt up by fire. When it contracts owing to water, it is all
dissolved by water up to the Subhakiṇha \[Brahmā-world\]. When it
contracts owing to air, it is all demolished by wind up to the
Vehapphala \[Brahmā-world\].



[31.]In breadth it is always one of the Buddha-fields that is
destroyed. For the Buddha-fields are of three kinds, that is, the field
of birth, the field of authority, and the field of scope.



Herein, the field of birth is limited by the ten thousand world-spheres
that quaked on the Perfect One's taking rebirth-linking, and so on. The
field of authority is limited by the hundred thousand million
world-spheres where the following safeguards (*paritta*) are
efficacious, that is, the Ratana Sutta (Sn p.39), the Khandha Paritta
(Vin II 109; A II 72), the Dhajagga Paritta (S I 218), the Āṭānāṭiya
Paritta (D III 194), and the Mora Paritta (J-a II 33). The field of
scope is boundless, immeasurable: "As far as he wishes" (A I 228), it is
said. The Perfect One knows anything anywhere that he wishes. So one of
these three Buddha- fields, that is to say, the field of authority is
destroyed. But when that is being destroyed, the field of birth also
gets destroyed. And that happens simultaneously; and when it is
reconstituted, that happens simultaneously (cf. M-a IV 114).



[32.]Now, it should be understood how its destruction and
reconstitution come about thus. On the occasion when the aeon is
destroyed by fire \[415\] first of all a great cloud heralding the
aeon's destruction appears, and there is a great downpour all over the
hundred thousand million world-spheres. People are delighted, and they
bring out all their seeds and sow them. But when the sprouts have grown
enough for an ox to graze, then not a drop of rain falls any more even
when the asses bray. Rain is withheld from then on. This is what the
Blessed One referred to when he said: "Bhikkhus, an occasion comes when
for many years, for many hundreds of years, for many thousands of years,
for many hundreds of thousands of years, there is no rain" (A IV 100).
Beings that live by rain die and are reborn in the Brahmā-world, and so
are the deities that live on flowers and fruits.



[33.]When a long period has passed in this way, the water gives
out here and there. Then in due course the fishes and turtles die and
are reborn in the Brahmā- world, and so are the beings in hell. Some say
that the denizens of hell perish there with the appearance of the
seventh sun (§41).



Now, there is no rebirth in the Brahmā-world without jhāna; and some of
them, being obsessed with the scarcity of food, are unable to attain
jhāna, so how are they reborn there? By means of jhāna obtained in the
\[sense-sphere\] divine world.



[]



[]



[34.]For then the sense-sphere deities called world-marshal
(*loka-byūha*) deities come to know that at the end of a hundred
thousand years there will be the emergence of an aeon, and they travel
up and down the haunts of men, their heads bared, their hair
dishevelled, with piteous faces, mopping their tears with their hands,
clothed in dyed cloth, and wearing their dress in great disorder. They
make this announcement: "Good sirs, good sirs, at the end of a hundred
thousand years from now there will be the emergence of an aeon. This
world will be destroyed. Even the ocean will dry up. This great earth,
and the Sineru King of Mountains, will be consumed and destroyed. The
destruction of the earth will extend as far as the Brahmā-world. Develop
loving-kindness, good sirs, develop compassion, gladness, equanimity,
good sirs. Care for your mothers, care for your fathers, honour the
elders of your clans."



[35.] When human beings and earth deities hear their words,
they mostly are filled with a sense of urgency. They become kind to each
other and make merit with loving-kindness, etc., and so they are reborn
in the divine world. There they eat divine food, and they do the
preliminary work on the air kasiṇa and acquire jhāna. Others, however,
are reborn in a \[sense-sphere\] divine world through kamma to be
experienced in a future life. For there is no being traversing the round
of rebirths who is destitute of kamma to be experienced in a future
life. They too acquire jhāna there in the same way. \[416\] All are
eventually reborn in the Brahmā-world by acquiring jhāna in a
\[sense-sphere\] divine world in this way.



[36.]However, at the end of a long period after the withholding
of the rain, a second sun appears. And this is described by the Blessed
One in the way beginning, "Bhikkhus, there is the occasion when ..." (A
IV 100), and the Sattasuriya Sutta should be given in full. Now, when
that has appeared, there is no more telling night from day; as one sun
sets, the other rises. The world is uninterruptedly scorched by the
suns. But there is no sun deity in the aeon- destruction sun as there is
in the ordinary sun.11 Now, when the ordinary sun is present, thunder
clouds and mare's-tail vapours cross the skies. But when the
aeon-destruction sun is present, the sky is as blank as the disk of a
looking- glass and destitute of clouds and vapour. Beginning with the
rivulet, the water in all the rivers except the five great rivers12
dries up.



[37.]After that, at the end of a long period, a third sun
appears. And when that has appeared, the great rivers dry up too.



[38.]After that, at the end of a long period, a fourth sun
appears. And when that has appeared, the seven great lakes in Himalaya,
the sources of the great rivers,



11\. "The 'ordinary sun' is the sun's divine palace that arose before
the emergence of the aeon. But like the other sense-sphere deities at
the time of the emergence of the aeon, the sun deity too produces jhāna
and reappears in the Brahmā-world. But the actual sun's disk becomes
brighter and more fiery. Others say that it disappears and another
appears in its place" (Vism-mhṭ 412).\



12\. The five are the Ganges, Yamunā (Jumma), Sarabhu, Sarassatī, and
Mahī (Vism-mhṭ 412).



[]



[]



dry up, that is to say: Sīhapapāta, Haṃsapātana,13 Kaṇṇamuṇḍaka,
Rathakāra, Anotatta, Chaddanta, and Kuṇāla.



[39.]After that, at the end of a long period, a fifth sun
appears, and when that has appeared, there eventually comes to be not
enough water left in the great ocean to wet one finger joint.



[40.]After that, at the end of a long period, a sixth sun
appears, and when that has appeared, the whole world-sphere becomes
nothing but vapour, all its moisture being evaporated.



And the hundred thousand million world-spheres are the same as this one.



[41.]After that, at the end of a long period, a seventh sun
appears. And when that has appeared, the whole world-sphere together
with the hundred thousand million other world-spheres catches fire. Even
the summits of Sineru, a hundred leagues and more high, crumble and
vanish into space. The conflagration mounts up and invades the realm of
the Four Kings. When it has burnt up all the golden palaces, the
jewelled palaces and the crystal palaces there, it invades the Realm of
the Thirty-three. And so it goes right on up to the plane of the first
jhāna. When it has burnt three \[lower\] Brahmā-worlds, it stops there
at the Ābhassara- world. \[417\] As long as any formed thing (formation)
the size of an atom still exists it does not go out; but it goes out
when all formed things have been consumed. And like the flame that burns
ghee and oil, it leaves no ash.



[42.] The upper space is now all one with the lower space in a
vast gloomy darkness. Then at the end of a long period a great cloud
arises, and at first it rains gently, and then it rains with ever
heavier deluges, like lotus stems, like rods, like pestles, like palm
trunks, more and more. And so it pours down upon all burnt areas in the
hundred thousand million world-spheres till they disappear. Then the
winds (forces) beneath and all around that water rise up and compact it
and round it, like water drops on a lotus leaf. How do they compact the
great mass of water? By making gaps; for the wind makes gaps in it here
and there.



[43.] Being thus compressed by the air, compacted and reduced,
it gradually subsides. As it sinks, the \[lower\] Brahmā-world reappears
in its place, and worlds divine reappear in the places of the four upper
divine worlds of the sensual sphere.14 But when it has sunk to the
former earth's level, strong winds (forces) arise and they stop it and
hold it stationary, like the water in a water pot when the outlet is
plugged. As the fresh water gets used up, the essential humus makes its
appearance on it. That possesses colour, smell and taste, like the
surface film on milk rice when it dries up.



[44.]Then the beings that were reborn first in the Brahmā-world
of Streaming- radiance (Ābhassara) fall from there with the exhaustion
of their life span, or



13\. *Haṃsapātana* is another name for *Maṇḍākinī.* (Vism-mhṭ) For seven
Great Lakes see A IV 101.\



14\. "At the place where the Yāma Deities are established. The places
where the Cātumahārājika and Tāvatiṃsa heavens become established do not
reappear at first because they are connected with the earth" (Vism-mhṭ
412).



[]



[]



when their merit is exhausted, and they reappear here. They are
self-luminous and wander in the sky. On eating the essential humus, as
is told in the Aggañña Sutta (D III 85), they are overcome by craving,
and they busy themselves in making lumps of it to eat. Then their
self-luminosity vanishes, and it is dark. They are frightened when they
see the darkness.



[45.]Then in order to remove their fears and give them courage,
the sun's disk appears full fifty leagues across. They are delighted to
see it, thinking, "We have light," and they say, "It has appeared in
order to allay our fears and give us courage (*sūrabhāva*), so let it be
called 'sun' (*suriya*)." So they give it the name "sun" (*suriya*).
Now, when the sun has given light for a day, it sets. Then they are
frightened again, thinking, "We have lost the light we had," and they
think, "How good if we had another light!" \[418\]



[46.]As if knowing their thought, the moon's disk appears,
forty-nine leagues across. On seeing it they are still more delighted,
and they say, "It has appeared, seeming as if it knew our desire
(*chanda*), so let it be called 'moon' (*canda*)." So they give it the
name "moon" (*canda*).



[47.]After the appearance of the moon and sun in this way, the
stars appear in their constellations. After that, night and day are made
known, and in due course, the month and half month, the season, and the
year.



[48.] On the day the moon and sun appear, the mountains of
Sineru, of the World-sphere and of Himalaya appear too. And they appear
on the full-moon day of the month of Phagguna (March), neither before
nor after. How? Just as, when millet is cooking and bubbles arise, then
simultaneously, some parts are domes, some hollow, and some flat, so
too, there are mountains in the domed places, seas in the hollow places,
and continents (islands) in the flat places.



[49.] Then, as these beings make use of the essential humus,
gradually some become handsome and some ugly. The handsome ones despise
the ugly ones. Owing to their contempt the essential humus vanishes and
an outgrowth from the soil appears. Then that vanishes in the same way
and the *badālatā* creeper appears. That too vanishes in the same way
and the rice without red powder or husk that ripens without tilling
appears, a clean sweet-smelling rice fruit.



[50.]Then vessels appear. These beings put the rice into the
vessels, which they put on the tops of stones. A flame appears
spontaneously and cooks it. The cooked rice resembles jasmine flowers.
It has no need of sauces and curries, since it has whatever flavour they
want to taste.



[51.]As soon as they eat this gross food, urine and excrement
appear in them. Then wound orifices break open in them to let these
things out. The male sex appears in the male, and the female sex in the
female. Then the females brood over the males, and the males over the
females for a long time. Owing to this long period of brooding, the
fever of sense desires arises. After that they practice sexual
intercourse.



[52.]\[419\] For their \[overt\] practice of evil they are
censured and punished by the wise, and so they build houses for the
purpose of concealing the evil. When they live in houses, they
eventually fall in with the views of the more lazy, and



[]



[]



they make stores of food. As soon as they do that, the rice becomes
enclosed in red powder and husks and no longer grows again of itself in
the place where it was reaped. They meet together and bemoan the fact,
"Evil has surely made its appearance among beings; for formerly we were
mind-made ..." (D III 90), and all this should be given in full in the
way described in the Aggañña Sutta.



[53.]After that, they set up boundaries. Then some being takes
a portion given to another. After he has been twice rebuked, at the
third time they come to blows with fists, clods, sticks, and so on. When
stealing, censuring, lying, resorting to sticks, etc., have appeared in
this way, they meet together, thinking, "Suppose we elect a being who
would reprove those who should be reproved, censure those who should be
censured, and banish those who should be banished, and suppose we keep
him supplied with a portion of the rice?" (D III 92).



[54.] When beings had come to an agreement in this way in this
aeon, firstly this Blessed One himself, who was then the Bodhisatta
(Being due to be Enlightened), was the handsomest, the most comely, the
most honourable, and was clever and capable of exercising the effort of
restraint. They approached him, asked him, and elected him. Since he was
recognized (*sammata*) by the majority (*mahā-jana*) he was called Mahā
Sammata. Since he was lord of the fields (*khetta*) he was called
khattiya (warrior noble). Since he promoted others' good (*rañjeti*)
righteously and equitably he was a king (*rājā*). This is how he came to
be known by these names. For the Bodhisatta himself is the first man
concerned in any wonderful innovation in the world. So after the
khattiya circle had been established by making the Bodhisatta the first
in this way, the brahmans and the other castes were founded in due
succession.



[55.] Herein, the period from the time of the great cloud
heralding the aeon's destruction up till the ceasing of the flames
constitutes one incalculable, and that is called the "contraction." That
from the ceasing of the flames of the aeon destruction up till the great
cloud of rehabilitation, which rains down upon the hundred thousand
million world-spheres, constitutes the second incalculable, and that is
called, "what supersedes the contraction." That from the time of the
great cloud of rehabilitation up till the appearance of the moon and sun
constitutes the third incalculable, and that is called the "expansion."
That from the appearance of the moon and sun up till \[420\] the
reappearance of the great cloud of the aeon destruction is the fourth
incalculable, and that is called, "what supersedes the expansion." These
four incalculables make up one great aeon. This, firstly, is how the
destruction by fire and reconstitution should be understood.



[56.]The occasion when the aeon is destroyed by water should be
treated in the way already described beginning, "First of all a great
cloud heralding the aeon's destruction appears ..." (§32).



[57.] There is this difference, however. While in the former
case a second sun



appeared, in this case a great cloud of caustic waters15 appears. At
first it rains



15\. *Khārudaka---*"caustic waters": the name given to the waters on
which the world- spheres rest (see M-a IV 178).



[]



[]



very gently, but it goes on to rain with gradually greater deluges,
pouring down upon the hundred thousand million world-spheres. As soon as
they are touched by the caustic waters, the earth, the mountains, etc.,
melt away, and the waters are supported all round by winds. The waters
take possession from the earth up to the plane of the second jhāna. When
they have dissolved away the three Brahmā- worlds there, they stop at
the Subhakiṇha-world. As long as any formed thing the size of an atom
exists they do not subside; but they suddenly subside and vanish away
when all formed things have been overwhelmed by them. All beginning
with: "The upper space is all one with the lower space in a vast gloomy
darkness ..." (§42) is as already described, except that here the world
begins its reappearance with the Ābhassara Brahmā-world. And beings
falling from the Subhakiṇha Brahmā-world are reborn in the places
beginning with the Ābhassara Brahmā-world.



[58.] Herein, the period from the time of the great cloud
heralding the aeon's destruction up till the ceasing of the
aeon-destroying waters constitutes one incalculable. That from the
ceasing of the waters up till the great cloud of rehabilitation
constitutes the second incalculable. That from the great cloud of
rehabilitation ... These four incalculables make up one great aeon. This
is how the destruction by water and reconstitution should be understood.



[59.] The occasion when the aeon is destroyed by air should be
treated in the way already described beginning with the "first of all a
great cloud heralding the aeon's destruction appears ..." (§32).



[60.]There is this difference, however. While in the first case
there was a second sun, here a wind arises in order to destroy the aeon.
First of all it lifts up the coarse flue, then the fine flue, then the
fine sand, coarse sand, gravel, stones, etc., \[421\] until it lifts up
stones as big as a catafalque,16 and great trees standing in uneven
places. They are swept from the earth up into the sky, and instead of
falling down again they are broken to bits there and cease to exist.



[61.]Then eventually wind arises from underneath the great
earth and overturns the earth, flinging it into space. The earth splits
into fragments measuring a hundred leagues, measuring two, three, four,
five hundred leagues, and they are hurled into space too, and there they
are broken to bits and cease to exist. The world-sphere mountains and
Mount Sineru are wrenched up and cast into space, where they crash
against each other till they are broken to bits and disappear. In this
way it destroys the divine palaces built on the earth \[of Mount
Sineru\] and those built in space, it destroys the six sensual-sphere
divine worlds, and it destroys the hundred thousand million
world-spheres. Then world-sphere collides with world-sphere, Himalaya
Mountain with Himalaya Mountain, Sineru with Sineru, till they are
broken to bits and disappear.



[62.] The wind takes possession from the earth up to the plane
of the third jhāna. There, after destroying three Brahmā-worlds, it
stops at the Vehapphala- world. When it has destroyed all formed things
in this way, it spends itself too.



16\. *Kūṭāgāra:* see Ch. XII, n.14; here this seems the most likely of
the various meanings of the word.



[]



[]



Then all happens as already described in the way beginning, "The upper
space is all one with the lower space in a vast gloomy darkness ..."
(§42). But here the world begins its reappearance with the Subhakiṇha
Brahmā-world. And beings falling from the Vehapphala Brahmā-world are
reborn in the places beginning with the Subhakiṇha Brahmā-world.



[63.] Herein, the period from the time of the great cloud
heralding the aeon's destruction up till the ceasing of the
aeon-destroying wind is one incalculable. That from the ceasing of the
wind up till the great cloud of rehabilitation is the second
incalculable ... These four incalculables make up one great aeon. This
is how the destruction by wind and reconstitution should be understood.



[64.]What is the reason for the world's destruction in this
way? The \[three\] roots of the unprofitable are the reason. When any
one of the roots of the unprofitable becomes conspicuous, the world is
destroyed accordingly. When greed is more conspicuous, it is destroyed
by fire. When hate is more conspicuous, it is destroyed by
water---though some say that it is destroyed by fire when hate is more
conspicuous and by water when greed is more conspicuous. And when
delusion is more conspicuous, it is destroyed by wind.



[65.]Destroyed as it is in this way, it is destroyed for seven
turns in succession by fire and the eighth turn by water; then again
seven turns by fire and the eighth turn by water; then, when it has been
seven times destroyed by water at each eighth \[422\] turn, it is again
destroyed for seven turns by fire. Sixty-three eons pass in this way.
And now the air takes the opportunity to usurp the water's turn for
destruction, and in destroying the world it demolishes the Subhakiṇha
Brahmā-world where the life span is the full sixty-four eons.



[66.]Now, when a bhikkhu capable of recollecting eons is
recollecting his former lives, then of such eons as these he recollects
*many eons of world contraction, many eons of world expansion, many eons
of world contraction and expansion*. How? In the way beginning, *There I
was* ...



Herein, *There I was*: in that eon of contraction I was in that kind of
becoming or generation or destiny or station of consciousness or abode
of beings or order of beings.



[67.] *So named*: \[such forenames as\] Tissa, say, or Phussa.
*Of such a race*: \[such family names as\] Kaccāna, say, or Kassapa.
This is said of the recollection of his own name and race (surname) in
his past existence. But if he wants to recollect his own appearance at
that time, or whether his life was a rough or refined one, or whether
pleasure or pain was prevalent, or whether his life span was short or
long, he recollects that too. Hence he said with *such an appearance ...
such the end of my life span*.



[68.] Here,  *with such an appearance* means fair or dark.
*Such was my food*: with white rice and meat dishes as food or with
windfall fruits as food. *Such my experience of pleasure and pain*: with
varied experience of bodily and mental pleasure and pain classed as
worldly and unworldly, and so on. *Such the end of my life span*: with
such a life span of a century or life span of eighty-four thousand eons.



[]



[]



[69.] *And passing away from there, I reappeared elsewhere*:
having passed away from that becoming, generation, destiny, station of
consciousness, abode of beings or order of beings, I again appeared in
that other becoming, generation, destiny, station of consciousness,
abode of beings or order of beings. *And there too I was*: then again I
was there in that becoming, generation, destiny, station of
consciousness, abode of beings or order of beings. *So named*, etc., are
as already stated.



[70.]Furthermore, the words *there I was* refer to the
recollection of one who has cast back retrospectively as far as he
wishes, and the words *and passing away from there* refer to his
reviewing after turning forward again; consequently, the words  *I
appeared elsewhere* can be understood to be said with reference to the
place of his reappearance next before his appearance here, which is
referred to by the words *I appeared here*. But the words *there too I
was*, etc., \[423\] are said in order to show the recollection of his
name, race, etc., there in the place of his reappearance next before
this appearance. *And passing away from there, I reappeared here*:
having passed away from that next place of reappearance, I was reborn
here in this khattiya clan or brahman clan.



[71.] *Thus*: so. *With its aspects and particulars*: with its
particulars consisting in name and race; with its aspects consisting in
appearance, and so on. For it is by means of name and race that a being
is particularized as, say Tissa Kassapa; but his distinctive personality
is made known by means of appearance, etc., as dark or fair. So the name
and race are the particulars, while the others are the aspects. *He
recollects his manifold past lives*: the meaning of this is clear.



The explanation of the knowledge of recollection of past lives is ended.



\[(5) THE DIVINE EYE---KNOWLEDGE OF PASSING AWAY AND\
REAPPEARANCE OF BEINGS\]



[72.]As to the explanation of the knowledge of passing away and
reappearance of beings, \[here is the text: "He directs, he inclines,
his mind to the knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of
beings. With the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human,
he sees beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair
and ugly, happy or unhappy in their destiny; he understands beings as
faring according to their deeds: 'These worthy beings who were
ill-conducted in body, speech and mind, revilers of Noble Ones, wrong in
their views, acquirers of kamma due to wrong view, have, on the breakup
of the body, after death, appeared in a state of loss, in an unhappy
destiny, in perdition in hell; but these worthy beings, who are well
conducted in body, speech and mind, not revilers of Noble Ones, right in
their views, acquirers of kamma due to right view, have, on the breakup
of the body, after death, appeared in a happy destiny, in the heavenly
world.' Thus with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the
human, he sees beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and
superior, fair and ugly, happy or unhappy in their destiny; he
understands beings as faring according to their deeds" (D I 82).
Herein,\]  *to the knowledge of the passing away and reappearance*:
*cutūpapātañāṇāya*=\
*cutiyā ca upapāte ca ñāṇāya* (resolution of compound); \[the meaning
is,\] for the



[]



[]



kind of knowledge by means of which beings' passing away and
reappearance is known; for knowledge of the divine eye, is what is
meant. *He directs, he inclines his mind*: he both directs and inclines
preliminary-work consciousness. He is the bhikkhu who does the directing
of his mind.



[73.]But as regards *with the divine eye*, etc., it is *divine*
because of its similarity to the divine; for deities have as divine eye
the sensitivity that is produced by kamma consisting in good conduct and
is unimpeded by bile, phlegm, blood, etc., and capable of receiving an
object even though far off because it is liberated from imperfections.
And this eye, consisting in knowledge, which is produced by the power of
this bhikkhu's energy in development, is similar to that, so it is
"divine" because it is similar to the divine. Also it is "divine"
because it is obtained by means of divine abiding, and because it has
divine abiding as its support. And it is "divine" because it greatly
illuminates by discerning light. And it is "divine" because it has a
great range through seeing visible objects that are behind walls, and so
on. All that should be understood according to the science of grammar.
It is an *eye* in the sense of seeing. Also it is an eye since it is
like an eye in its performance of an eye's function. It is *purified*
since it is a cause of purification of view, owing to seeing passing
away and reappearance.



[74.] One who sees only passing away and not reappearance
assumes the annihilation view; and one who sees only reappearance and
not passing away assumes the view that a new being appears. But since
one who sees both outstrips that twofold \[false\] view, that vision of
his is therefore a cause for purification of view. And the Buddhas' sons
see both of these. Hence it was said above: \[424\] "It is 'purified'
since it is a cause of purification of view, owing to seeing passing
away and reappearance."



[75.] *It surpasses the human* in the seeing of visible objects
by surpassing the human environment. Or it can be understood that it
*surpasses the human* in surpassing the human fleshly eye. With that
*divine eye*,  *which is purified and superhuman*, *he sees beings*, he
watches beings as men do with the fleshly eye.



[76.]*Passing away and reappearing*: he cannot see them with
the divine eye actually at the death moment of reappearance.17 But it is
those who, being on the verge of death, will die now that are intended
as "passing away" and those who have taken rebirth-linking and have just
reappeared that are intended by



17\. *"'He cannot see them with the divine* eye'---with the knowledge of
the divine eye--- because of the extreme brevity and extreme subtlety of
the material moment in anyone. Moreover, it is present materiality that
is the object of the divine eye, and that is by prenascence condition.
And there is no occurrence of exalted consciousness without adverting
and preliminary work. Nor is materiality that is only arising able to
serve as object condition, nor that which is dissolving. Therefore, it
is rightly said that he cannot see with the divine eye materiality at
the moments of death and reappearance. If the knowledge of the divine
eye has only materiality as its object, then why is it said that he
'sees beings'? It is said in this way since it is mainly concerned with
instances of materiality in a being's continuity, or because that
materiality is a reason for apprehending beings. Some say that this is
said according to conventional usage" (Vism-mhṭ 417).



[]



[]



"reappearing." What is pointed out is that he sees them as such passing
away and reappearing.



[77.] *Inferior*: despised, disdained, looked down upon,
scorned, on account of birth, clan, wealth, etc., because of reaping the
outcome of delusion. *Superior*: the opposite of that because of reaping
the outcome of non-delusion. *Fair*: having a desirable, agreeable,
pleasing appearance because of reaping the outcome of non-hate.  *Ugly*:
having undesirable, disagreeable, unpleasing appearance because of
reaping the outcome of hate; unsightly, ill-favoured, is the meaning.
*Happy in their destiny*: gone to a happy destiny; or rich, very
wealthy, because of reaping the outcome of non-greed. Unhappy in their
destiny: gone to an unhappy destiny; or poor with little food and drink
because of reaping the outcome of greed.



[78.]*Faring according to their deeds*: moving on in accordance
with whatever deeds (*kamma*) may have been accumulated. Herein, the
function of the divine eye is described by the first expressions
beginning with "passing away." But the function of knowledge of faring
according to deeds is described by this last expression.



[79.]The order in which that knowledge arises is this. Here a
bhikkhu extends light downwards in the direction of hell, and he sees
beings in hell undergoing great suffering. That vision is only the
divine eye's function. He gives it attention in this way, "After doing
what deeds do these beings undergo this suffering?" Then knowledge that
has those deeds as its object arises in him in this way, "It was after
doing this." Likewise he extends light upwards in the direction of the
\[sensual-sphere\] divine world, and he sees beings in the Nandana
Grove, the Missaka Grove, the Phārusaka Grove, etc., enjoying great good
fortune. That vision also is only the divine eye's function. He gives
attention to it in this way, "After doing what deeds do these beings
enjoy this good fortune?" Then knowledge that has those deeds as its
object arises in him in this way, "It was after doing this." This is
what is called knowledge of faring according to deeds.



[80.]There is no special preliminary work for this. And as in
this case, so too in the case of knowledge of the future; for these have
the divine eye as their basis and their success is dependent on that of
the divine eye. \[425\]



[81.]As to *ill-conducted in body*, etc., it is bad conduct
(*duṭṭhu caritaṃ*), or it is corrupted conduct (*duṭṭhaṃ caritaṃ*)
because it is rotten with defilements, thus it is ill-conduct
(*duccarita*). The ill-conduct comes about by means of the body, or the
ill-conduct has arisen due to the body, thus it is ill-conduct in body;
so too with the rest. *Ill-conducted* is endowed with ill-conduct.



[82.]*Revilers of Noble Ones*: being desirous of harm for Noble
Ones consisting of Buddhas, Paccekabuddhas, and disciples, and also of
householders who are stream-enterers, they revile them with the worst
accusations or with denial of their special qualities (see Ud 44 and MN
12); they abuse and upbraid them, is what is meant.



[83.] Herein, it should be understood that when they say, "They
have no



asceticism, they are not ascetics," they revile them with the worst
accusation;



[]



[]



and when they say, "They have no jhāna or liberation or path of
fruition, etc.," they revile them with denial of their special
qualities. And whether done knowingly or unknowingly it is in either
case reviling of Noble Ones; it is weighty kamma resembling that of
immediate result, and it is an obstacle both to heaven and to the path.
But it is remediable.



[84.]The following story should be understood in order to make
this clear. An elder and a young bhikkhu, it seems, wandered for alms in
a certain village. At the first house they got only a spoonful of hot
gruel. The elder's stomach was paining him with wind. He thought, "This
gruel is good for me; I shall drink it before it gets cold." People
brought a wooden stool to the doorstep, and he sat down and drank it.
The other was disgusted and remarked, "The old man has let his hunger
get the better of him and has done what he should be ashamed to do." The
elder wandered for alms, and on returning to the monastery he asked the
young bhikkhu, "Have you any footing in this Dispensation, friend?"---
"Yes, venerable sir, I am a stream-enterer."---"Then, friend, do not try
for the higher paths; one whose cankers are destroyed has been reviled
by you." The young bhikkhu asked for the elder's forgiveness and was
thereby restored to his former state.



[85.]So one who reviles a Noble One, even if he is one himself,
should go to him; if he himself is senior, \[426\] he should sit down in
the squatting position and get his forgiveness in this way, "I have said
such and such to the venerable one; may he forgive me." If he himself is
junior, he should pay homage, and sitting in the squatting position and
holding out his hand palms together, he should get his forgiveness in
this way, "I have said such and such to you, venerable sir; forgive me."
If the other has gone away, he should get his forgiveness either by
going to him himself or by sending someone such as a co-resident.



[86.]If he can neither go nor send, he should go to the
bhikkhus who live in that monastery, and, sitting down in the squatting
position if they are junior, or acting in the way already described if
they are senior, he should get forgiveness by saying, "Venerable sirs, I
have said such and such to the venerable one named so and so; may that
venerable one forgive me." And this should also be done when he fails to
get forgiveness in his presence.



[87.]If it is a bhikkhu who wanders alone and it cannot be
discovered where he is living or where he has gone, he should go to a
wise bhikkhu and say, "Venerable sir, I have said such and such to the
venerable one named so and so. When I remember it, I am remorseful. What
shall I do?" He should be told, "Think no more about it; the elder
forgives you. Set your mind at rest." Then he should extend his hands
palms together in the direction taken by the Noble One and say, "Forgive
me."



[88.]If the Noble One has attained the final Nibbāna, he should
go to the place where the bed is, on which he attained the final
Nibbāna, and should go as far as the charnel ground to ask forgiveness.
When this has been done, there is no obstruction either to heaven or to
the path. He becomes as he was before.



[89.] *Wrong in their views*: having distorted vision.
*Acquirers of kamma due to*



*wrong view*: those who have kamma of the various kinds acquired through
wrong



[]



[]



view, and also those who incite others to bodily kamma, etc., rooted in
wrong view. And here, though reviling of Noble Ones has already been
included by the mention of verbal misconduct, and though wrong view has
already been included by the mention of mental misconduct, it may be
understood, nevertheless, that the two are mentioned again in order to
emphasize their great reprehensibility.



[90.]Reviling Noble Ones is greatly reprehensible because of
its resemblance to kamma with immediate result. For this is said:
"Sāriputta, just as a bhikkhu possessing virtuous conduct, concentration
and understanding could here and now attain final knowledge, so it is in
this case, I say; if he does not abandon such talk and such thoughts and
renounce such views, he will find himself in hell as surely as if he had
been carried off and put there" (M I 71).18 \[427\] And there is nothing
more reprehensible than wrong view, according as it is said: "Bhikkhus,
I do not see any one thing so reprehensible as wrong view" (A I 33).



[91.] *On the breakup of the body*: on the giving up of the
clung-to aggregates. After death: in the taking up of the aggregates
generated next after that. Or alternatively,  *on the breakup of the
body* is on the interruption of the life faculty, and  *after death* is
beyond the death consciousness.



[92.]*A state of loss* and the rest are all only synonyms for
hell. Hell is a *state of loss* (*apāya*) because it is removed
(*apeta*) from the reason (*aya*)19 known as merit, which is the cause
of \[attaining\] heaven and deliverance; or because of the absence
(*abhāva*) of any origin (*āya*) of pleasures. The destiny (*gati*,
going), the refuge, of suffering (*dukkha*) is the *unhappy destiny*
(*duggati*); or the destiny (*gati*) produced by kamma that is corrupted
(*duṭṭha*) by much hate (*dosa*) is an *unhappy destiny* (*duggati*).
Those who commit wrongdoings, being separated out (*vivasa*) fall
(*nipatanti*) in here, thus it is *perdition*  (*vinipāta*); or
alternatively, when they are destroyed (*vinassanto*), they fall
(*patanti*) in here, all their limbs being broken up, thus it is
*perdition* (*vinipāta*). There is no reason (*aya*) reckoned as
satisfying here, thus it is hell (*niraya*).



[93.]Or alternatively, the animal generation is indicated by
the mention of *states of loss*; for the animal generation is a state of
loss because it is removed from the happy destiny; but it is not an
unhappy destiny because it allows the existence of royal nāgas
(serpents), who are greatly honoured. The realm of ghosts is indicated
by the mention of the *unhappy destiny*; for that is both a state of
loss and an unhappy destiny because it is removed from the happy destiny
and because it is the destiny of suffering; but it is not perdition
because it is not a state of perdition such as that of the asura demons.
The race of asura demons is indicated by the mention of *perdition*; for
that is both a state of loss and an unhappy destiny in the way already
described, and it is called "perdition" (deprivation) from all
opportunities. Hell itself in the various aspects of Avīci, etc., is
indicated by the mention of *hell*.



18\. In rendering *yathābhataṃ* here in this very idiomatic passage M-a
II 32 has been consulted.\



19\. For the word *aya* see XVI.17.



[]



[]



*Have ... appeared*: have gone to; have been reborn there, is the
intention.



[94.]The bright side should be understood in the opposite way.
But there is this difference. Here the mention of the happy destiny
includes the human destiny, and only the divine destiny is included by
the mention of *heavenly*. Herein, a good (*sundara*) destiny (*gati*)
is a *happy destiny*  (*sugati*). It is the very highest (*suṭṭhu aggo*)
in such things as the objective fields comprising visible objects, etc.,
thus it is *heavenly* (*sagga*). All that is a world (*loka*) in the
sense of crumbling and disintegrating (*lujjana-palujjana*). This is the
word meaning.



*Thus with the divine eye*, etc., is all a summing-up phrase; the
meaning here in



brief is this: so with the divine eye ... he sees.



[95.] Now, a clansman who is a beginner and wants to see in
this way should make sure that the jhāna, which has a kasiṇa as its
object and is the basis for direct-knowledge, is made in all ways
susceptible of his guidance. Then one of these three kasiṇas, that is to
say, the fire kasiṇa, white kasiṇa, \[428\] or light kasiṇa, should be
brought to the neighbourhood \[of the arising of divine-eye knowledge\].
He should make this access jhāna his resort and stop there to extend
\[the kasiṇa\]; the intention is that absorption should not be aroused
here; for if he does induce absorption, the \[kasiṇa\] will become the
support for basic jhāna, but not for the \[direct-knowledge\]
preliminary work. The light kasiṇa is the best of the three. So either
that, or one of the others, should be worked up in the way stated in the
Description of the Kasiṇas, and it should be stopped at the level of
access and extended there. And the method for extending it should be
understood in the way already described there too. It is only what is
visible within the area to which the kasiṇa has been extended that can
be seen.



[96.] However, while he is seeing what is visible, the turn of
the preliminary work runs out. Thereupon the light disappears. When that
has disappeared, he no longer sees what is visible (cf. M III 158). Then
he should again and again attain the basic jhāna, emerge and pervade
with light. In this way the light gradually gets consolidated till at
length it remains in whatever sized area has been delimited by him in
this way, "Let there be light here." Even if he sits watching all day he
can still see visible objects.



[97.]And here there is the simile of the man who set out on a
journey by night with a grass torch. Someone set out on a journey by
night, it seems, with a grass torch. His torch stopped flaming. Then the
even and uneven places were no more evident to him. He stubbed the torch
on the ground and it again blazed up. In doing so it gave more light
than before. As it went on dying out and flaring up again, eventually
the sun rose. When the sun had risen, he thought, "There is no further
need of the torch," and he threw it away and went on by daylight.



[98.]Herein, the kasiṇa light at the time of the preliminary
work is like the light of the torch. His no more seeing what is visible
when the light has disappeared owing to the turn of the preliminary work
running out while he is seeing what is visible is like the man's not
seeing the even and uneven places owing to the torch's stopping flaming.
His repeated attaining is like the stubbing of the torch. His more
powerful pervasion with light by repeating the preliminary work is like
the torch's giving more light than before. The strong light's



[]



[]



remaining in as large an area as he delimits is like the sun's rising.
His seeing even during a whole day what is visible in the strong light
after throwing the limited light away is like the man's going on by day
after throwing the torch away.



[99.]Herein, when visible objects that are not within the focus
of the bhikkhu's fleshly eye come into the focus of his eye of
knowledge---that is to say, visible objects that are inside his belly,
belonging to the heart basis, belonging to what is below the earth's
surface, behind walls, mountains and enclosures, or in another
world-sphere---\[429\] and are as if seen with the fleshly eye, then it
should be understood that the divine eye has arisen. And only that is
capable of seeing the visible objects here, not the preliminary-work
consciousnesses.



[100.] But this is an obstacle for an ordinary man. Why?
Because wherever he determines, "Let there be light," it becomes all
light, even after penetrating through earth, sea and mountains. Then
fear arises in him when he sees the fearful forms of spirits, ogres,
etc., that are there, owing to which his mind is distracted and he loses
his jhāna. So he needs to be careful in seeing what is visible (see M
III 158).



[101.] Here is the order of arising of the divine eye: when
mind-door adverting, which has made its object that visible datum of the
kind already described, has arisen and ceased, then, making that same
visible datum the object, all should be understood in the way already
described beginning, "Either four or five impulsions impel ..." (§5)
Here also the \[three or four\] prior consciousnesses are of the sense
sphere and have applied and sustained thought. The last of these
consciousnesses, which accomplishes the aim, is of the fine-material
sphere belonging to the fourth jhāna. Knowledge conascent with that is
called "knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings" and
"knowledge of the divine eye."



The explanation of knowledge of passing away and reappearance is ended.



\[GENERAL\]



[102.] The Helper, knower of five aggregates, Had these five
direct-knowledges to tell;\
When they are known, there are concerning them\
These general matters to be known as well.



[103.] Among these, the divine eye, called knowledge of passing
away and reappearance, has two accessory kinds of knowledge, that is to
say, "knowledge of the future" and "knowledge of faring according to
deeds." So these two along with the five beginning with the kinds of
supernormal power make seven kinds of direct-knowledge given here.



[104.] Now, in order to avoid confusion about the
classification of their objects:



The Sage has told four object triads\
By means of which one can infer\
Just how these seven different kinds\
Of direct-knowledges occur.



[]



[]



[105.] Here is the explanation. Four object triads have been
told by the Greatest of the Sages. What four? The limited-object triad,
the path-object triad, the past- object triad, and the internal-object
triad.20



[106.] (1) Herein, *knowledge of supernormal power* \[430\]
occurs with respect to seven kinds of object, that is to say, as having
a limited or exalted, a past, future or present, and an internal or
external object. How?



When he wants to go with an invisible body after making the body
dependent on the mind, and he converts the body to accord with the mind
(XII.119), and he sets it, mounts it, on the exalted consciousness, then
taking it that the \[word in the\] accusative case is the proper
object,21 it *has a limited object* because its object is the material
body. When he wants to go with a visible body after making the mind
dependent on the body and he converts the mind to accord with the body
and sets it, mounts it, on the material body, then taking it that the
\[word in the\] accusative case is the proper object, it *has an exalted
object* because its object is the exalted consciousness.



[107.] But that same consciousness takes what has passed, has
ceased, as its object, therefore it *has a past object*. In those who
resolve about the future, as in the case of the Elder Mahā Kassapa in
the Great Storing of the Relics, and others, it has a future object.
When the Elder Mahā Kassapa was making the great relic store, it seems,
he resolved thus, "During the next two hundred and eighteen years in the
future let not these perfumes dry up or these flowers wither or these
lamps go out," and so it all happened. When the Elder Assagutta saw the
Community of Bhikkhus eating dry food in the Vattaniya Lodging he
resolved thus, "Let the water pool become cream of curd every day before
the meal," and when the water was taken before the meal it was cream of
curd; but after the meal there was only the normal water.22



20\. See  *Abhidhamma Mātikā* ("schedule"), Dhs 1f. This consists of 22
sets of triple classifications  *(tika) * and 100 sets of double ones
*(duka). * The first triad "profitable, unprofitable, and \[morally\]
indeterminate," and the first dyad is "root-cause, not- root-cause." The
*Mātikā* is used in the Dhammasaṅgaṇī (for which it serves as the basic
structure), in the Vibhaṅga (in some of the "Abhidhamma Sections" and in
the "Questionnaires") and in the Paṭṭhāna. All dhammas are either
classifiable according to these triads and dyads, under one of the
headings, if the triad or dyad is all- embracing, or are called
"not-so-classifiable" *(na-vattabba),* if the triad or dyad is not. The
four triads mentioned here are: no. 13, "dhammas with a limited object,
with an exalted object, with a measureless object"; no. 16, "dhammas
with a path as object, with a path as root-cause, with path as
predominance"; no. 19, "dhammas with a past object, with a future
object, with a present object"; and no. 21, "dhammas with an internal
object, with an external object, with an internal-external object."



21\. The "word in the accusative case" is in the first instance "body,"
governed by the verb "converts" *(kāyaṃ pariṇāmeti);* see Vism-mhṭ.\



22\. Vism-mhṭ comments: "Although with the words: *'These perfumes,'*
etc., he apprehends present perfumes, etc., nevertheless the object of
his resolving consciousness is actually their future materiality that is
to be associated with the distinction of not drying up*.* This is
because the resolve concerns the future ... *'Cream of curd':* when
resolving, his object is the future appearance of curd."

[108.] At the time of going with an invisible body after making
the body



dependent on the mind it *has a present object*.



At the time of converting the mind to accord with the body, or the body
to accord with the mind, and at the time of creating one's own
appearance as a boy, etc., it *has an internal object* because it makes
one's own body and mind its object. But at the time of showing
elephants, horses, etc., externally it has *an external object*.



This is how, firstly, the kinds of supernormal power should be
understood to



occur with respect to the seven kinds of object.



[109.](2) *Knowledge of the divine ear element* occurs with
respect to four kinds of object, that is to say, as having a limited,
and a present, and an internal or external object. How?



Since it makes sound its object and since sound is limited (see Vibh
74), it therefore has a limited object.23 But since it occurs only by
making existing sound its object, it *has a present object*. At the time
of hearing sounds in one's own belly it has an internal object. At the
time of hearing the sounds of others it *has an external object*.
\[431\] This is how the knowledge of the divine ear element should be
understood to occur with respect to the four kinds of object.



[110.](3) *Knowledge of penetration of minds* occurs with
respect to eight kinds of object, that is to say, as having a limited,
exalted or measureless object, path as object, and a past, future or
present object, and an external object. How?



At the time of knowing others' sense-sphere consciousness it *has a
limited* *object*. At the time of knowing their fine-material-sphere or
immaterial-sphere consciousness it *has an exalted object*. At the time
of knowing path and fruition it has a measureless object. And here an
ordinary man does not know a stream- enterer's consciousness, nor does a
stream-enterer know a once-returner's, and so up to the Arahant's
consciousness. But an Arahant knows the consciousness of all the others.
And each higher one knows the consciousnesses of all those below him.
This is the difference to be understood. At the time when it has path
consciousness as its object it *has path as object*. But when one knows
another's consciousness within the past seven days, or within the future
seven days, then it *has a past object* and *has a future object*
respectively.



[111.] How does it have a present object? "Present"
(*paccuppanna*) is of three kinds, that is to say, present by moment,
present by continuity, and present by extent. Herein, what has reached
arising (*uppāda*), presence (*ṭhiti*), and dissolution (*bhaṅga*) is
*present by moment*. What is included in one or two rounds of continuity
is *present by continuity*.



[112.] Herein, when someone goes to a well-lit place after
sitting in the dark, an



object is not clear at first; until it becomes clear, one or two rounds
of continuity



Vattanīyasenāsana was apparently a monastery in the Vindhya Hills
(*Viñjaṭavī*): see Mhv XIX.6; Dhs-a 419. The Elders Assagutta and Rohaṇa
instructed Kajaṅgala who was sent to convert Menander (Lamotte,
*Histoire de la Bouddhisme Indien,* p. 440).



23\. Cf. also Vibh 62 and 91.

[]



should be understood \[to pass\] meanwhile. And when he goes into an
inner closet after going about in a well-lit place, a visible object is
not immediately evident at first; until it becomes clear, one or two
rounds of continuity should be understood \[to pass\] meanwhile. When he
stands at a distance, although he sees the alterations (movements) of
the hands of washer-men and the alterations (movements) of the striking
of gongs, drums, etc., yet he does not hear the sound at first (see Ch.
XIV n. 22); until he hears it, one or two rounds of continuity should be
understood \[to pass\] meanwhile. This, firstly, is according to the
Majjhima reciters.



[113.] The Saṃyutta reciters, however, say that there are two
kinds of continuity, that is to say, material continuity and immaterial
continuity: that a material continuity lasts as long as the \[muddy\]
line of water touching the bank when one treads in the water takes to
clear,24 as long as the heat of the body in one who has walked a certain
extent takes to die down, as long as the blindness in one who has come
from the sunshine into a room does not depart, as long as when, after
someone has been giving attention to his meditation subject in a room
and then opens the shutters by day and looks out, the dazzling in his
eyes does not die down; and that an immaterial continuity consists in
two or three rounds of impulsions. Both of these are \[according to
them\] called "present by continuity." \[432\]



[114.] What is delimited by a single becoming (existence) is
called *present by* *extent*, with reference to which it is said in the
Bhaddekaratta Sutta: "Friends, the mind and mental objects are both what
is present. Consciousness is bound by desire and greed for what is
present. Because consciousness is bound by desire and greed he delights
in that. When he delights in that, then he is vanquished with respect to
present states" (M III 197).



And here, "present by continuity" is used in the Commentaries while
"present



by extent" is used in the Suttas.



[115.]Herein, some25 say that consciousness "present by moment"
is the object of knowledge of penetration of minds. What reason do they
give? It is that the consciousness of the possessor of supernormal power
and that of the other arise in a single moment. Their simile is this:
just as when a handful of flowers is thrown into the air, the stalk of
one flower is probably struck by the stalk of another, and so too, when
with the thought, "I will know another's mind," the mind of a multitude
is adverted to as a mass, then the mind of one is probably penetrated by
the mind of the other either at the moment of arising or at the moment
of presence or at the moment of dissolution.



[116.] That, however, is rejected in the Commentaries as
erroneous, because even if one went on adverting for a hundred or a
thousand years, there is never co- presence of the two consciousnesses,
that is to say, of that with which he adverts



24\. Vism-mhṭ adds: "Some however explain the meaning in this way: It is
as long as, when one has stepped on the dry bank with a wet foot, the
water line on the foot does not disappear."\



25\. The residents of the Abhayagiri Monastery in Anurādhapura
(Vism-mhṭ).



[]



[]



and that \[of impulsion\] with which he knows, and because the flaw of
plurality of objects follows if presence \[of the same object\] to both
adverting and impulsion is not insisted on. What should be understood is
that the object is present by continuity and present by extent.



[117.] Herein, another's consciousness during a time measuring
two or three cognitive series with impulsions extending before and after
the \[strictly\] currently existing cognitive series with impulsions, is
all called "present by continuity." But in the Saṃyutta Commentary it is
said that "present by extent" should be illustrated by a round of
impulsions.



[118.] That is rightly said. Here is the illustration. The
possessor of supernormal- power who wants to know another's mind
adverts. The adverting \[consciousness\] makes \[the other's
consciousness that is\] present by moment its object and ceases together
with it. After that there are four or five impulsions, of which the last
is the supernormal-power consciousness, the rest being of the sense
sphere. That same \[other's\] consciousness, which has ceased, is the
object of all these too, and so they do not have different objects
because they have an object that is "present by extent." And while they
have a single object it is only the supernormal-power consciousness that
actually knows another's consciousness, not the others, just as in the
eye-door it is only eye-consciousness that actually sees the visible
datum, not the others.



[119.] So this has a present object in what is present by
continuity and what is present by extent. \[433\] Or since what is
present by continuity falls within what is present by extent, it can
therefore be understood that it has a present object simply in what is
present by extent.



It *has an external object* because it has only another's mind as its
object.



This is how knowledge of penetration of minds should be understood to



occur with respect to the eight kinds of objects.



[120.](4) *Knowledge of past lives* occurs with respect to
eight kinds of object, that is to say, as having a limited, exalted, or
measureless object, path as object, a past object, and an internal,
external, or not-so-classifiable object. How?



At the time of recollecting sense-sphere aggregates it *has a limited
object*. At the time of recollecting fine-material-sphere or
immaterial-sphere aggregates it *has an exalted object*. At the time of
recollecting a path developed, or a fruition realized, in the past
either by oneself or by others, it *has a measureless object*. At the
time of recollecting a path developed it *has a path as object*. But it
invariably *has a past object*.



[121.]Herein, although knowledge of penetration of minds and
knowledge of faring according to deeds also have a past object, still,
of these two, the object of the knowledge of penetration of minds is
only consciousness within the past seven days. It knows neither other
aggregates nor what is bound up with aggregates \[that is, name,
surname, and so on\]. It is said indirectly that it has a path as object
since it has the consciousness associated with the path as its object.
Also, the object of knowledge of faring according to deeds is simply
past volition. But there is nothing, whether past aggregates or what is
bound up



[]



[]



with aggregates, that is not the object of knowledge of past lives; for
that is on a par with omniscient knowledge with respect to past
aggregates and states bound up with aggregates. This is the difference
to be understood here.



[122.] This is the method according to the Commentaries here.
But it is said in the Paṭṭhāna: "Profitable aggregates are a condition,
as object condition, for knowledge of supernormal power, for knowledge
of penetration of minds, for knowledge of past lives, for knowledge of
faring according to deeds, and for knowledge of the future" (Paṭṭh I
154), and therefore four aggregates are also the objects of knowledge of
penetration of minds and of knowledge of faring according to deeds. And
there too profitable and unprofitable \[aggregates are the object\] of
knowledge of faring according to deeds.



[123.] At the time of recollecting one's own aggregates it *has
an internal object*. At the time of recollecting another's aggregates it
*has an external object*. At the time of recollecting \[the concepts
consisting in\] name, race (surname) in the way beginning, "In the past
there was the Blessed One Vipassin. His mother was Bhandumatī. His
father was Bhandumant" (see D II 6--7), and \[the concept consisting
in\] the sign of the earth, etc., it *has a not-so-classifiable object*.
And here the name and race (surname, lineage) must be regarded not as
the actual words but as the meaning of the words, which is established
by convention and bound up with aggregates. For the actual words \[434\]
are "limited" since they are included by the sound base, according as it
is said: "The discrimination of language has a limited object" (Vibh
304). Our preference here is this.



This is how the knowledge of past lives should be understood to occur
with



respect to the eight kinds of object.



[124.](5) *Knowledge of the divine eye* occurs with respect to
four kinds of object, that is to say, as having a limited, a present,
and an internal or external object. How? Since it makes materiality its
object and materiality is limited (see Vibh 62) it therefore *has a
limited object*. Since it occurs only with respect to existing
materiality it *has a present object*. At the time of seeing materiality
inside one's own belly, etc., it *has an internal object*. At the time
of seeing another's materiality it  *has an external object*. This is
how the knowledge of the divine eye should be understood to occur with
respect to the four kinds of object.



[125.](6) *Knowledge of the future* occurs with respect to
eight kinds of object, that is to say, as having a limited or exalted or
immeasurable object, a path as object, a future object, and an internal,
external, or not-so classifiable object. How? At the time of knowing
this, "This one will be reborn in the future in the sense sphere," it
*has a limited object*. At the time of knowing, "He will be reborn in
the fine-material or immaterial sphere," it *has an exalted object*. At
the time of knowing, "He will develop the path, he will realize
fruition," it *has an immeasurable object*. At the time of knowing, "He
will develop the path," it *has a path as object* too. But it invariably
*has a future object*.



[126.] Herein, although knowledge of penetration of minds has a
future object too, nevertheless its object is then only future
consciousness that is within seven days; for it knows neither any other
aggregate nor what is bound up with



[]



[]



aggregates. But there is nothing in the future, as described under the
knowledge of past lives (§121), that is not an object of knowledge of
the future.



[127.] At the time of knowing, "I shall be reborn there," it
*has an internal object*. At the time of knowing, "So-and-so will be
reborn there," it *has an external object*. But at the time of knowing
name and race (surname) in the way beginning, "In the future the Blessed
One Metteyya will arise. His father will be the brahman Subrahmā. His
mother will be the brahmani Brahmavatī" (see D III 76), it has a
not-so-classifiable object in the way described under knowledge of past
lives (§123).



This is how the knowledge of the future should be understood.



[128.](7)  *Knowledge of faring according to deeds* occurs with
respect to five kinds of object, that is to say, as having a limited or
exalted, a past, and an internal or external object. How? At the time of
knowing sense-sphere kamma (deeds) it *has a limited object*. \[435\] At
the time of knowing fine-material-sphere or immaterial- sphere kamma it
*has an exalted object*. Since it knows only what is past it *has a past
object*. At the time of knowing one's own kamma it *has an internal
object*. At the time of knowing another's kamma it *has an external
object*. This is how the knowledge of faring according to deeds should
be understood to occur with respect to the five kinds of object.



[129.] And when \[the knowledge\] described here both as
"having an internal object" and "having an external object" knows
\[these objects\] now internally and now externally, it is then said
that it *has an internal-external object* as well.

Understanding (*Paññā*)



[]







## CHAPTER XIV 


THE AGGREGATES



(*Khandha-niddesa*)



\[A. UNDERSTANDING\]



[1.]\[436\] Now, concentration was described under the heading
of *consciousness* in the stanza:



When a wise man, established well in virtue,\
Develops consciousness and understanding (I.1).



And that has been developed in all its aspects by the bhikkhu who is
thus possessed of the more advanced development of concentration that
has acquired with direct-knowledge the benefits \[described in Chs. XII
and XIII\]. But *understanding* comes next and that has still to be
developed. Now, that is not easy, firstly even to know about, let alone
to develop, when it is taught very briefly. In order, therefore, to deal
with the detailed method of its development there is the following set
of questions:



[(i)]



What is understanding?



[(ii)]



In what sense is it understanding?



[(iii)]



What  are its characteristic, function, manifestation, and



proximate cause?



[(iv)]



How  many kinds of understanding are there?



[(v)]



How is it developed?



[(vi)]



What  are the benefits of developing understanding?



[2.]Here are the answers:



[(i)] *WHAT IS UNDERSTANDING?* Understanding (*paññā*) is of
many sorts and has various aspects. An answer that attempted to explain
it all would accomplish neither its intention nor its purpose, and
would, besides, lead to distraction; so we shall confine ourselves to
the kind intended here, which is understanding consisting in insight
knowledge associated with profitable consciousness.



[3.](ii) *IN WHAT SENSE IS IT UNDERSTANDING?* It is
understanding (*paññā*) in the sense of act of understanding
(*pajānana*).1 What is this act of understanding? It is



1\. Cf. Paṭis I 42, etc.; Abhidhamma definitions very commonly make use
of the Pali forms of verbal nouns, here instanced by *paññā *
(understanding = state of under-\
standing) and *pajānana* (understanding = act of understanding), both
from the verb


[]



[]



knowing (*jānana*) in a particular mode separate from the modes of
perceiving (*sañjānana*) and cognizing (*vijānana*). \[437\] For though
the state of knowing (*jānana-bhāva*) is equally present in perception
(*saññā*), in consciousness (*viññāṇa*), and in understanding (*paññā*),
nevertheless perception is only the mere perceiving of an object as,
say, blue or yellow; it cannot bring about the penetration of its
characteristics as impermanent, painful, and not-self. Consciousness
knows the objects as blue or yellow, and it brings about the penetration
of its characteristics, but it cannot bring about, by endeavouring, the
manifestation of the \[supramundane\] path. Understanding knows the
object in the way already stated, it brings about the penetration of the
characteristics, and it brings about, by endeavouring, the manifestation
of the path.



[4.]Suppose there were three people, a child without
discretion, a villager, and a money-changer, who saw a heap of coins
lying on a money-changer's counter. The child without discretion knows
merely that the coins are figured and ornamented, long, square or round;
he does not know that they are reckoned as valuable for human use and
enjoyment. And the villager knows that they are figured and ornamented,
etc., and that they are reckoned as valuable for human use and
enjoyment; but he does not know such distinctions as, "This one is
genuine, this is false, this is half-value." The money-changer knows all
those kinds, and he does so by looking at the coin, and by listening to
the sound of it when struck, and by smelling its smell, tasting its
taste, and weighing it in his hand, and he knows that it was made in a
certain village or town or city or on a certain mountain or by a certain
master. And this may be understood as an illustration.



[5.] Perception is like the child without discretion seeing the
coin, because it apprehends the mere mode of appearance of the object as
blue and so on. Consciousness is like the villager seeing the coin,
because it apprehends the mode of the object as blue, etc., and because
it extends further, reaching the penetration of its characteristics.
Understanding is like the money-changer seeing the coin, because, after
apprehending the mode of the object as blue, etc., and extending to the
penetration of the characteristics, it extends still further, reaching
the manifestation of the path.



That is why this act of understanding should be understood as "knowing
in a particular mode separate from the modes of perceiving and
cognizing." For that is what the words "it is understanding in the sense
of act of understanding" refer to.



[6.]However, it is not always to be found where perception and
consciousness are.2 \[438\] But when it is, it is not disconnected from
those states. And because it cannot be taken as disconnected thus: "This
is perception, this is consciousness, this is understanding," its
difference is consequently subtle and hard to see. Hence the venerable
Nāgasena said: "A difficult thing, O King, has been done by the Blessed
One."---"What, venerable Nāgasena, is the difficult thing that has been
done by the Blessed One?"---"The difficult thing, O King, done by the
Blessed One was the



*pajānāti* (he understands). English does not always, as in this case,
distinguish between the two. Similarly, for example, from the verb
*socati* (he sorrows) we find *soka* (sorrow, state of* * sorrowing) and
*socana * (sorrowing, act of sorrowing), and here the English
differentiates. Cf. parallel treatment of *paññā* at M-a II 343f.



[]



[]



defining of the immaterial states of consciousness and its concomitants,
which occur with a single object, and which he declared thus: 'This is
contact, this is feeling, this is perception, this is volition, this is
consciousness'" (Mil 87).



[7.](iii) *WHAT  ARE  ITS  CHARACTERISTIC, FUNCTION, 
MANIFESTATION  AND  PROXIMATE  CAUSE?* Understanding has the
characteristic of penetrating the individual essences of states.3 Its
function is to abolish the darkness of delusion, which conceals the
individual essences of states. It is manifested as non-delusion. Because
of the words, "One who is concentrated knows and sees correctly" (A V
3), its proximate cause is concentration.



[8.](iv)  *HOW  MANY  KINDS  OF  UNDERSTANDING  ARE  THERE?*



[1.] Firstly, as having the characteristic of penetrating the
individual essences of states, it is of one kind.



[2.] As mundane and supramundane it is of two kinds.



[3.] Likewise as subject to cankers and free from cankers, and
so on,



[4.] As the defining of mentality and of materiality,



[5.] As accompanied by joy or by equanimity,



[6.] As the planes of seeing and of development.



[7.] It is of three kinds as consisting in what is reasoned,
consisting



in what is learnt (heard), and consisting in development.



[8.] Likewise as having a limited, exalted, or measureless
object,



[9.] As skill in improvement, detriment, and means,



[10.] As interpreting the internal, and so on.



[11.] It is of four kinds as knowledge of the four truths,



[12.] And as the four discriminations.4



[9.] Herein, the singlefold section is obvious in
meaning.



*2.* As regards the twofold section, the *mundane* is that associated
with the mundane path and the *supramundane* is that associated with the
supramundane path. So it is of two kinds as mundane and supramundane.



2\. "In arisings of consciousness with two root-causes \[i.e. with
non-greed and non- hate but without non-delusion\], or without
root-cause, understanding does not occur" (Vism-mhṭ 432). "Just as
pleasure is not invariably inseparable from happiness, so perception and
consciousness are not invariably inseparable from understanding. But
just as happiness is invariably inseparable from pleasure, so
understanding is invariably inseparable from perception and
consciousness" (Vism-mhṭ 432).



3\. "A phenomenon's own essence (*sako bhāvo*) or existing essence
*(samāno vā bhāva)* is its individual essence *(sabhāva*)" (Vism-mhṭ
433). Cf. Ch. VIII, note 68, where Vism- mhṭ gives the definition from
*saha-bhāva* (with essence).



4\. *Paṭisambhidā * is usually rendered by "analysis" (see e.g. *Points
of Controversy---* *Kathāvatthu* translation---pp. 377ff). But the
Tipiṭaka explanations of the four *paṭisambhidā* suggest no emphasis on
*analysis* rather than *synthesis.* Vism-mhṭ gives the following
definition of the term: "Knowledge that is classified (*pabheda-gata* =
put into a division)\
under meaning *(attha)* as capable of effecting the explanation and
definition of specific



[]



[]



[10.] *3.* In the second dyad, that *subject to cankers* is
that which is the object of cankers. That *free from cankers* is not
their object. This dyad is the same in meaning as the mundane and
supramundane. The same method applies to the dyads subject to cankers
and free from cankers, associated with cankers and dissociated from
cankers (Dhs 3), and so on. So it is of two kinds as subject to cankers
and free from cankers, and so on.



[11.] *4.* In the third dyad, when a man wants to begin
insight, his understanding of the defining of the four immaterial
aggregates is understanding as *defining of mentality*, \[439\] and his
understanding of the defining of the material aggregate is understanding
as *defining of materiality*. So it is of two kinds as the defining of
mentality and of materiality.



[12.] *5.* In the fourth dyad, understanding belonging to two
of the kinds of sense-sphere profitable consciousness, and belonging to
sixteen5 of the kinds of path consciousness with four of the jhānas in
the fivefold method, is *accompanied by joy*. Understanding belonging to
two of the kinds of sense-sphere profitable consciousness, and belonging
to (the remaining) four kinds of path consciousness with the fifth
jhānas is *accompanied by equanimity*. So it is of two kinds as
accompanied by joy or by equanimity.



[13.] *6.* In the fifth dyad, understanding belonging to the
first path is the *plane of* *seeing*. Understanding belonging to the
remaining three paths is the *plane of development* (see XXII.127). So
it is of two kinds as the planes of seeing and of development.



[14.] *7.* As regards the triads, understanding acquired
without hearing from another is that *consisting in what is reasoned*
because it is produced by one's own reasoning. Understanding acquired by
hearing from another is that *consisting in what is heard*, because it
is produced by hearing. Understanding that has reached absorption,
having been somehow produced by (meditative) development, is that
consisting in development. And this is said: Herein, what is
understanding consisting in what is reasoned? In the spheres of work
invented by ingenuity, or in the spheres of craft invented by ingenuity,
or in the sorts of science invented by ingenuity, any preference, view,
choice, opinion, judgment, liking for pondering over things, that
concerns ownership of deeds (*kamma*) or is in conformity with truth or
is of such kind as to conform with (the axioms) 'Materiality is
impermanent' or 'Feeling ... perception ... formations ...



characteristics of the meaning class (meaning division) is called
*attha-paṭisambhidā;* and so with the other three" (Vism-mhṭ 436).
"Discrimination" has been chosen for *paṭisambhidā* because, while it
has the sense of "division," it does not imply an opposite process as
"analysis" does. Also it may be questioned whether the four are well
described as "entirely logical": "entirely epistemological" might
perhaps be both less rigid and nearer; for they seem to cover four
interlocking fields, namely: meanings of statements and effects of
causes (etc.), statements of meanings and causes of effects (etc.),
language as restricted to etymological rules of verbal expression, and
clarity (or perspicuous inspiration) in marshalling the other three.\



5\. I.e. the four paths with the first jhāna and those with the second,
third, and fourth, out of the five (Vism-mh 434).

consciousness is impermanent' that one acquires without hearing it from
another---that is called understanding consisting in what is reasoned.



(In the spheres ) that one acquires by hearing it from another---that is
called



understanding consisting in what is learnt (heard).



And all understanding in anyone who has attained (an attainment) is



understanding consisting in development (Vibh 324--25).



So it is of three kinds as consisting in what is thought out, in what is
heard,



and in development.



[15.] *8. * In the second triad, the understanding that occurs
contingent upon sense-sphere states has a *limited* object. That which
occurs contingent upon fine-material-sphere states or immaterial-sphere
states has an *exalted* object. That is mundane insight. That which
occurs contingent upon Nibbāna has a *measureless* object. That is
supramundane insight. So it is of three kinds as having a limited, an
exalted, or a measureless object.



[16.] *9.* In the third triad, it is increase that is called
improvement. That is twofold as the elimination of harm and the arousing
of good. Skill in improvement is skill in these, according as it is
said: Herein, what is skill in improvement? When a man brings these
things to mind both unarisen unprofitable things do not arise and arisen
unprofitable things are abandoned in him; or when he brings these things
to mind \[440\] both unarisen profitable things arise and arisen
profitable things advance to growth, increase, development, and
perfection in him. Whatever here is understanding, act of understanding 
\[for words elided see Dhs 16\]  non-delusion, investigation of states,
right view, is called skill in improvement (Vibh 325--26).



[17.] Non-increase is what is called *detriment*. That also is
twofold as the diminution of good and the arousing of harm. Skill in
detriment is skill in these, according as it is said: "Herein, what is
skill in detriment? When a man brings these things to mind, both
unarisen profitable things do not arise ..." (Vibh 326), and so on.



[18.]But in either of these cases any skill in means to cause
the production of such and such things, which skill occurs at that
moment and is aroused on that occasion, is what is called *skill in
means*, according as it is said: "And all understanding of means thereto
is *skill in means*" (Vibh 326).



So it is of three kinds as skill in improvement, in detriment, and in
means.



[19.] *10.* In the fourth triad, insight-understanding
initiated by apprehending one's own aggregates is *interpreting the
internal*.6 That initiated by apprehending another's aggregates or
external materiality not bound up with the faculties, \[that is,
inanimate matter\], is *interpreting the external*. That initiated by
apprehending both is *interpreting the internal and external*. So it is
of three kinds as interpreting the internal, and so on.



6\. The word *abhinivisati* with its noun *abhinivesa* means literally
"to dwell on," and so "to adhere," or "insist." In the Tipiṭaka it
always appears in a bad sense and always

[20.] *11.* As regards the tetrads, in the first tetrad,
knowledge that occurs contingent upon the truth of suffering is
*knowledge of suffering*; knowledge that occurs contingent upon the
origin of suffering is *knowledge of the origin of suffering*; knowledge
that occurs contingent upon the cessation of suffering is *knowledge of
the cessation of suffering*; and knowledge that occurs contingent upon
the way leading to the cessation of suffering is *knowledge of the way
leading to the cessation of suffering*. So it is of four kinds as
knowledge of the four truths.



[21.] *12.* In the second tetrad, the four kinds of knowledge
classed as that concerned with meaning, etc., are called the *four
discriminations*. For this is said: "Knowledge about meaning is the
discrimination of meaning (*attha- paṭisambhidā*). Knowledge about law
is the discrimination of law (*dhamma- paṭisambhidā*). Knowledge about
enunciation of language dealing with meaning and law is the
discrimination of language (*nirutti-paṭisambhidā*). Knowledge about
kinds of knowledge is discrimination of perspicuity (*paṭibhāna-
paṭisambhidā*)" (Vibh 293).



[22.] Herein, *meaning* (*attha*) is briefly a term for the
fruit of a cause (*hetu*). For in accordance with the cause it is
served7 arrived at, reached, therefore it is called "meaning" (or
"purpose"). But in particular the five things, namely, (i) anything
conditionally produced, \[441\] (ii) Nibbāna, (iii) the meaning of what
is spoken, (iv) (kamma-) result, and (v) functional (consciousness),
should be understood as  *meaning*. When anyone reviews that meaning,
any knowledge of his, falling within the category (*pabheda*) concerned
with meaning, is the *discrimination of meaning*.



[23.]*Law* (*dhamma*) is briefly a term for a condition
(*paccaya*). For since a condition necessitates (*dahati*) whatever it
may be, makes it occur or allows it to happen, it is therefore called
"law" (*dhamma*). But in particular the five things, namely, (i) any
cause that produces fruit, (ii) the noble path, (iii) what is spoken,
(iv) what is profitable, and (v) what is unprofitable, should be
understood as *law*. When anyone reviews that law, any knowledge of his,
falling within the category concerned with law, is the *discrimination
of law*.



appears in contexts with wrong view and clinging (see e.g. M III 30--31,
Nidd I 436, and also Vism-mhṭ quoted above at I. 140). However, in the
Commentaries, the word appears also in a good sense as at XIV.130,
XXI.73 and 83f., and at M-a I 250 (cf. *saddhaṃ nivisati,* M II 173). In
this good sense it is synonymous with *right* interpretation of
experience. All the bare experience of perception is interpreted by the
mind either in the sense of permanence, pleasure, self, which is wrong
because it is not confirmed by experience, or in the sense of
impermanence, etc., which is right because it is confirmed by experience
(see XIV. 130). There is no not interpreting experience, and it is a
function of the mind that the interpretation adopted is "dwelt upon,"
i.e. insisted upon. And so it is this insistence or interpretation in
accordance with reality as confirmed by experience that is the
*abhinivesa* of the Commentaries in the good sense. For these reasons
the words *interpretation, misinterpretation* and  *insistence * have
been chosen here as renderings.\



7\. *Arīyati---*"to honour, to serve." Not in PED. Cf. ger. *araṇīya*
(M-a I 21,173), also not in PED, explained by the *Majjhima Nidāya ṭīkā*
as "to be honoured" (*payirūpasitabba*)*.*



[]



[]



[24.]This same meaning is shown in the Abhidhamma by the
following analysis:



\(a\) "Knowledge about suffering is the *discrimination of meaning*.
Knowledge about the origin of suffering is the *discrimination of law*.
\[Knowledge about the cessation of suffering is the *discrimination of
meaning*. Knowledge about the way leading to the cessation of suffering
is the *discrimination of law*\] ...



\(b\) "Knowledge about cause is the *discrimination of law*. Knowledge
about the



fruit of a cause is the *discrimination of meaning* ...



[(c)] "Knowledge about whatever things are born, become,
brought to birth, produced, completed, made manifest, is the
*discrimination of meaning*. Knowledge about the things from which those
things were born, became, were brought to birth, produced, completed,
made manifest, is the *discrimination of law*  ...



\(d\) "Knowledge about ageing and death is the *discrimination of
meaning*. Knowledge about the origin of ageing and death is the
*discrimination of law*. \[Knowledge about the cessation of ageing and
death is the *discrimination of meaning*. Knowledge about the way
leading to the cessation of ageing and death is the *discrimination of
law*. Knowledge about birth ... becoming ... clinging ... craving ...
feeling ... contact ... the sixfold base ... mentality- materiality ...
consciousness ... knowledge about formations is the *discrimination of
meaning*. Knowledge about the origin of formations is the
*discrimination of law*.\] Knowledge about the cessation of formations
is the *discrimination of meaning*. Knowledge about the way leading to
the cessation of formations is the *discrimination of law*  ...



\(e\) "Here a bhikkhu knows the Dhamma (Law)---the Discourses, Songs,
\[Expositions, Stanzas, Exclamations, Sayings, Birth Stories, Marvels,
and\] Answers to Questions---this is called the *discrimination of law*.
He knows the meaning of whatever is said thus: 'This is the meaning of
this that was said; this is the meaning of this that was said'---this is
called the *discrimination of meaning* ...



\(f\) "What states are profitable? On an occasion when profitable
consciousness of the sense sphere has arisen \[that is accompanied by
joy and associated with knowledge, having a visible datum as its object
... or a mental datum as its object, or contingent upon whatever it may
be, on that occasion there is contact ... (for elision see Dhs §1) ...
there is non-wavering\]--- these things are profitable. Knowledge about
these things is the discrimination of law. Knowledge about their result
is the discrimination of meaning" ... (Vibh 293--95).8



[25.]*Knowledge about enunciation of language dealing with
meaning and law* (§21): there is the language that is individual
essence, the usage that has no exceptions,9 and deals with that meaning
and that law. Any knowledge falling within the category concerned with
the enunciation of that, with the speaking, with the utterance of that,
concerned with the root-speech of all beings, the Magadhan

clarity.

language that is individual essence, in other words, the language of law
(*dhamma*), \[any knowledge that\] as soon as it hears it spoken,
pronounced, uttered, knows, "This is the individual-essence language;
this is not the individual- essence language"---\[such knowledge\] is
*discrimination of language*.10 \[442\] One who has reached the
discrimination of language knows, on hearing the words "*phasso,
vedanā*," etc., that that is the individual-essence language, and on
hearing "*phassā,* *vedano*," etc., he knows that that is not the
individual-essence language.



[26.]*Knowledge about kinds of knowledge* (§21): when a man is
reviewing and makes any of the foregoing kinds of knowledge the object
\[of his knowledge\], then any knowledge in him that has knowledge as
its object is *discrimination of perspicuity*, and so is any knowledge
about these aforesaid kinds of knowledge, which is concerned with
details of their individual domains, functions, and so on.



[27.]And these four kinds of discrimination can be placed in
two categories: the plane of the trainer and the plane of the
non-trainer. Herein, those of the chief disciples and great disciples
come into the category of the non-trainer's plane. Those of the Elder
Ānanda, the householder Citta, the layman Dhammika, the householder
Upāli, the laywoman Khujjuttarā, etc., come into the category of the
trainer's plane.



[28.]And though they come into the categories of the two planes
thus, they are nevertheless distinguishable in five aspects, that is to
say, as achievement, mastery of scriptures, hearing, questioning, and
prior effort. Herein, *achievement* is the reaching of Arahantship.
*Mastery of scriptures* is mastery of the Buddha's word. *Hearing* is
learning the Dhamma carefully and attentively. *Questioning* is
discussion of knotty passages and explanatory passages in the texts,
commentaries, and so on. *Prior effort* is devotion to insight in the
dispensation of former Buddhas, up to the vicinity of \[the stages of\]
conformity and change-of- lineage by one who has practiced \[the duty
of\] going \[with the meditation subject on alms round\] and coming back
\[with it\].11



[29.] Others have said:



A prior effort, and great knowledge,\
\[Knowledge of\] dialects, of scriptures,\
And questioning, and then achievement,\
And likewise waiting on a teacher,\
Success in friends---these are conditions\
Productive of discriminations.



9\. *Byabhicāra (vyabhicāra):* not in PED; normal grammarian's term for
an "exception."



10\. The idea behind the term "individual-essence language"
(*sabhāvanirutti*)*,* that is to say, that there is a real name for each
thing that is part of that thing's individual essence, is dealt with at
Dhs-a 391--92. Magadhan as "the root speech of all beings" and the
"individual-essence language" is dealt with in greater detail at Vibh-a
387.



11\. The expression *garapaccāgatikabhāva * refers to the practice of
"carrying the meditation subject to and from the alms round," which is
described at M-a I 257 in detail. The same expression is also used of a
certain kind of refuse-rag (see II. 17).



[]



[]



[30.] Herein, *prior effort* is the same as that already
stated. *Great learning* is skill in some science or sphere of craft.
*Dialects* means skill in the hundred-and-one tongues, particularly in
that of Magadha. *Scriptures* means mastery of the Buddha's word, even
if only of the Chapter of Similes.12 *Questioning* is questioning about
defining the meaning of even a single stanza. *Achievement* is
stream-entry ... or Arahantship. *Waiting on a teacher* is living with
very learned intelligent teachers. *Success in friends* is acquisition
of friends such as that. \[443\]



[31.] Herein, Buddhas and Paccekabuddhas reach the
discriminations through prior effort and through achievement. Disciples
do so through all these means. And there is no special way of developing
a meditation subject in order to attain discriminations. But in trainers
the attaining of the discriminations comes about next upon the
liberation consisting in trainers' fruition, and in non-trainers it does
so next upon the liberation consisting in non-trainers' fruition. For
the discriminations come to success in Noble Ones only through the noble
fruition as the ten powers do in Perfect Ones.



So these were the discriminations referred to when it was said above:
"It is of



four kinds ... as the four discriminations" (§8).



[32.] (v)  *HOW  IS  IT  DEVELOPED?* Now, tHE  THINGS  CLASSed
as aggregates, bases, elements, faculties, truths, dependent
origination, etc., are the soil of this understanding, and the \[first\]
two purifications, namely, purification of virtue and purification of
consciousness, are its roots, while the five purifications, namely,
purification of view, purification by overcoming doubt, purification by
knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path,
purification by knowledge and vision of the way, and purification by
knowledge and vision, are the trunk. Consequently, one who is perfecting
these should first fortify his knowledge by learning and questioning
about those things that are the "soil" after he has perfected the two
purifications that are the "roots," then he can develop the five
purifications that are the "trunk." This is in brief. The detail is as
follows.



\[B. DESCRIPTION OF THE FIVE AGGREGATES\]



[33.]When it was said above "the things classed as aggregates,
bases, elements, faculties, truths, dependent origination, etc., are the
soil," the aggregates here are the five aggregates, that is to say, the
materiality aggregate, the feeling aggregate, the perception aggregate,
the formations aggregate, and the consciousness aggregate.



\[THE  MATERIALITY  AGGREGATE\]



[34.]Herein, all kinds of states whatsoever that have the
characteristic of "being molested" (*ruppana*) by cold, etc., taken all
together should be understood as the materiality (*rūpa*) aggregate.



12\. "The 'Chapter of Similes' is the Chapter of Twin Verses in the
Dhammapada (Dhp 1--20), they say. Others say that it is the Book of
Pairs in the First Fifty (MN 31-- 40)" (Vism-mhṭ 436).



[]



[]



*1.* That is of one kind with the characteristic of "being molested."



*2.* It is also of two kinds when classed as (a) primary entity
(*bhūta*) and (b)



derived \[by clinging\] (*upādāya*).



[35.]Herein (a) *primary materiality* is of four kinds as the
earth element, water element, fire element, and air element. Their
characteristic, function, and manifestation have been given under the
definition of the four elements (XI.87, 93); but as to the proximate
cause, each has the other three as its proximate cause. \[444\]



[36.](b) *Derived materiality* is of twenty-four kinds as eye,
ear, nose, tongue, body, visible datum, sound, odour, flavour;13
femininity faculty, masculinity faculty, life faculty, heart-basis;
bodily intimation, verbal intimation; space element; lightness of
matter, malleability of matter, wieldiness of matter, growth of matter,
continuity of matter, ageing of matter, impermanence of matter, and
physical nutriment.



[37.] *1.* Herein, the *eye's* characteristic is sensitivity of
primary elements that is ready for the impact of visible data; or its
characteristic is sensitivity of primary elements originated by kamma
sourcing from desire to see.14 Its function is to



13\. "Tangible data are omitted from this list because, not being
derived matter, they are included in the primaries" (Vism-mhṭ 442). They
are described as consisting of three of the four primaries, excluding
the water (cohesion) element. "What is the materiality of the great
primaries? It is the tangible-data base and the water-element" (Dhs
663). For the whole list see Dhs 596, in which (N.B.) the heart-basis
does not appear. See also note 32 and Ch. XV, n. 15.\



14\. "Here the first-mentioned characteristic of the eye is described
according to the kamma that produces a selfhood, and is common to all of
it, and this without touching on differentiation is the cause. The
second is according to the specialized kamma generated thus, "Let my eye
be thus." This is what they say. But it can be taken that the
first-mentioned characteristic is stated as sensitivity's interest in
lighting up its own objective fields, the five senses' state of
sensitivity being taken as a generality; and that the second is stated
as the seeing that is due to the particular division of its own cause,
the sensitivities' cause as the state of kamma being taken as a
generality or as a unity. The same method applies to the ear and so on.\
"Here it may be asked, 'Is the arising of the faculties of the eye,
etc., due to kamma that is one or to kamma that is different?' Now, the
Ancients say, "In both ways." Herein, firstly, in the case of the
arising of an eye, etc., due to kamma that is different there is nothing
to be explained since the cause is divided up. But when their arising is
due to kamma that is one, how does there come to be differentiation
among them? It is due to dividedness in the cause too. For it is
craving, in the form of longing for this or that kind of becoming that,
itself having specific forms owing to hankering after the sense-bases
included in some kind of becoming or other, contrives, acting as
decisive- support, the specific divisions in the kamma that generates
such a kind of becoming. As soon as the kamma has acquired the
differentiation induced by that \[hankering\] it generates through
effort consisting in appropriate ability a multiple fruit with
differentiated individual essences, as though it had itself taken on a
multiple form. And the ability here need not be understood as anything
other than the able state; for it is simply the effort of producing
fruit that is differentiated by the differentiation due to the
differentiation in its cause. And the fact of this differentiating
effort on the part

pick up \[an object\]15 among visible data. It is manifested as the
footing of eye- consciousness. Its proximate cause is primary elements
born of kamma sourcing from desire to see.



[38.] The *ear's* characteristic is sensitivity of
primary elements that is ready for the impact of sounds; or its
characteristic is sensitivity of primary elements originated by kamma
sourcing from desire to hear. Its function is to pick up \[an object\]
among sounds. It is manifested as the footing of ear-consciousness. Its
proximate cause is primary elements born of kamma sourcing from desire
to hear.



[39.]*3. * The  *nose's* characteristic is sensitivity of
primary elements that is ready for the impact of odours; or its
characteristic is sensitivity of primary elements originated by kamma
sourcing from desire to smell. Its function is to pick up \[an object\]
among odours. It is manifested as the footing of nose-consciousness. Its
proximate cause is primary elements born of kamma sourcing from desire
to smell.



[40.]The *tongue's* characteristic is sensitivity
of primary elements that is ready for the impact of flavours; or its
characteristic is sensitivity of primary elements originated by kamma
sourcing from desire to taste. Its function is to pick up \[an object\]
among flavours. It is manifested as the footing of tongue-consciousness.
Its proximate cause is primary elements born of kamma sourcing from
desire to taste.



[41.]The body's characteristic is sensitivity of
primary elements that is ready for the impact of tangible data; or its
characteristic is sensitivity of primary elements originated by kamma
sourcing from desire to touch. Its function is to pick up \[an object\]
among tangible data. It is manifested as the footing of body-
consciousness. Its proximate cause is primary elements born of kamma
sourcing from desire to touch.



[42.]Some,16  however, say that the eye is sensitivity of
primary elements that have fire in excess, and that the ear, nose, and
tongue are sensitivity of primary elements that have \[respectively\]
air, earth, and water in excess, and that the body is that of all \[four
equally\]. Others say that the eye is sensitivity of those that have
fire in excess, and that the ear, nose, tongue, and body are
\[sensitivity\] of those that have \[respectively\] aperture, air,
water, and earth in excess. They should be asked to quote a sutta. They
will certainly not find one.



[43.]But some give as their reason that it is because these
\[several sensitivities\]



are \[respectively\] aided by visible data, etc., as qualities of fire,
and so on.17 They



of kamma that is one being the cause of the multiple faculties will be
dealt with below as to logic and texts (note 21). Besides, it is told
how one kind of consciousness only is the cause of the generation of the
sixteen kinds of resultant consciousness and so on; and in the world it
is also found that a single paddy seed is the cause of the generation of
the ripe, the unripe, the husked, and the unhusked fruit. But what is
the use of logical thinking? For the eye, etc., are the fruit of kamma;
and kamma-result is exclusively the province of a Buddha's knowledge"
(Vism-mhṭ 444).



15\. *Āviñjana---*"picking up": see *āvijjhati* in PED.



16\. *"'Some'* are certain Mahāsaṅghikas; for among these Vasudhamma
says this: 'In the eye fire is in excess; in the ear, air; in the nose,
earth; in the tongue, water; in the body all are equal'" (Vism-mhṭ 444).



[]



[]



should be asked, "But who has said that visible data, etc., are
qualities of fire and so on? \[445\] For it is not possible to say of
primary elements, which remain always inseparable,18 that 'This is a
quality of this one, that is a quality of that one.'"



[44.] Then they may say: "Just as you assume, from excess of
some primary element in such and such material things, the
\[respective\] functions of upholding (*sandhāraṇa*), etc., for earth,
etc., so from finding visibility, etc., \[respectively\] in a state of
excess19 in material things that have fire in excess, one may assume
that visible data, etc., are \[respectively\] qualities of these." They
should be told: "We might assume it if there were more odour in cotton,
which has earth in excess, than in fermented liquor, which has water in
excess, and if the colour of cold water were weaker than the colour of
hot water, which has heat in excess.



[45.]"But since neither of these is a fact, you should
therefore give up conjecturing the difference to be in the supporting
primary elements. Just as the natures of visible objects, etc., are
dissimilar from each other though there is no difference in the
primaries that form a single group, so too are eye-sensitivity, etc.,
though no other cause of their difference exists."20 This is how it
should be taken.



17\. *"'As qualities of fire, and so on':* \[aided\] by visible data as
the illuminating \[quality\] of heat, which is called lighting up; by
sound \[as a quality\] of air, by odour \[as a quality\] of earth, by
flavour \[as a quality\] of the water called spittle---so according to
the first theory \[that of 'some'\]; and it can be suitably adjusted to
accord with the second \[that of 'others'\] because they need to be
assisted by such and such qualities of primaries what is meant is that
they have to be helped in apprehending visible data and so on. This
theory holds that the quality is the ability of the eye, etc., to light
up \[respectively\] visible data, etc., only when associated with the
reasons that are their accessories consisting of light, etc., and
aperture's state of decisive support for ear-consciousness. Aperture is
taken in due order, as are fire, etc., since it is absence of primaries.
Or alternatively, when others intend that aperture is a quality of
primaries, as visible data, etc., are, then the qualities of primaries
are construable in their order thus: \[aided\] by visible data and light
\[as a quality\] of fire, by sound \[as a quality\] of aperture called
space, by odour \[as a quality\] of air, by flavour \[as a quality\] of
water, by tangible data \[as a quality\] of earth" (Vism-mhṭ 445).



18\. The four primaries are held to be inseparable and not to exist
separate from each other; cf. quotation from the "Ancients" in §45.
Vism-mhṭ says: "Excess is in capability, not in quantity, otherwise
their inseparability would be illogical" (Vism-mhṭ 451).



19\. *"'From finding visibility, etc., \[respectively\] in a state of
excess':* from finding them associated with these differences, namely,
the bright visible datum in fire, sound audible through its individual
essence in air, the odour beginning with *surabhi* perfume in earth, and
the sweet taste in water, thus *'visible data, etc., are the
\[respective\] qualities of these.'* This is according to the first
theory, and he has stated the conclusion *(uttara)* that follows,
beginning with *'we might assume'* in terms of that. The second is
confuted in the same way. Or alternatively, *'Then they may say,'* etc.,
can be taken as said emphasizing, in order to confute it, the theory of
Kaṇāda, which asserts that the eye, etc., are respectively made by fire,
space, earth, water, and air, that have visible data, etc., as their
respective qualities" (Vism-mhṭ 445).\



20\. In the P.T.S. text and Sinhalese Hewavitarne text the word
*ekakalāpe,* "that form a single group," occurs in this sentence but is
not in the Harvard text.

But what is it that is not common to them all?21 It is the kamma itself
that is the reason for their difference. Therefore their difference is
due to difference of kamma, not to difference of primary elements; for
if there were difference of primary elements, sensitivity itself would
not arise, since the Ancients have said: "Sensitivity is of those that
are equal, not of those that are unequal."



[46.]Now, among these \[sensitivities thus\] possessed of
difference due to differ- ence of kamma, the eye and the ear apprehend
non-contiguous objective fields, since consciousness is caused even if
the supporting \[primaries\] of the objective fields do not adhere to
the \[faculties'\] own supporting primaries.22 The nose,



21\. "If there is no differentiation according to primaries, what then
is the reason for the differentiation of the eye, and so on? Though the
kamma that is produced by the longing for a selfhood (individual
personality) with five sense-bases is one only, still it should be taken
as called *'not common to them all'* and *'difference of kamma'* because
it is the cause of the differentiation of the eye, and so on. For it is
not a condition for the ear through the same particular difference
through which it is a condition for the eye, since, if it were, it would
then follow that there was no distinction between the faculties. Because
of the words, 'At the moment of rebirth-linking, exalted volition is a
condition, as kamma condition, for the kinds of materiality due to kamma
performed' (Paṭṭh) it must be recognized that a single volition is kamma
condition for all the kinds of materiality due to kamma performed that
come into existence at the moment of rebirth-linking. For if the
volition were different, then, when there came to be the arising of the
faculties, it would follow that the materiality due to kamma performed
was generated by limited and exalted kamma. And rebirth-linking that is
one is not generated by a plurality of kinds of kamma. Thus it is
established that the arising of the plurality of the faculties is due to
a single kamma" (Vism-mhṭ 446).



22\. See also §134 and notes 60, 61. The amplification in this paragraph
is from Vism- mhṭ, which continues: "There is another method: the eye
and the ear have non-contiguous objective fields because arising of
consciousness is caused while their objective fields are separated by an
interval and apart *(adhika).* Some say that the ear has a contiguous
objective field. If it did, then sound born of consciousness would not
be the object of ear-consciousness, for there is no arising externally
of what is consciousness-originated. And in the texts sound as object is
spoken of as being the object of ear-consciousness without making any
distinction. Besides, there would be no defining the direction and
position of the sound because it would then have to be apprehended in
the place occupied by the possessor of the objective field, as happens
in the case of an odour. Consequently it remains in the same place where
it arose, if it comes into focus in the ear avenue (so the Burmese ed.).
Are not the sounds of washermen \[beating their washing on stones\]
heard later by those who stand at a distance? No; because there is a
difference in the way of apprehending a sound according to the ways in
which it becomes evident to one nearby and to one at a distance. For
just as, because of difference in the way of apprehending the sound of
words according to the ways in which it becomes evident to one at a
distance and to one nearby, there comes to be \[respectively\] not
apprehending, and apprehending of the differences in the syllables, so
also, when the sound of washermen (a) becomes \[an occurrence\] that is
evident throughout from beginning to end to one who is nearby, and (b)
becomes an occurrence that is evident in compressed form in the end or
in the middle to one who is at a distance, it is because there is a
difference in the

tongue and body apprehend contiguous objective fields, because
consciousness is caused only if their objective fields' \[primaries\]
adhere to their own supporting \[primaries\], \[that is to say, if the
objective fields' primaries adhere\] as support \[in the case of odours
and flavours\], and themselves \[directly in the case of tangible data,
which are identical with the three primaries excluding water\].



[47.] *1.* There is what is called the "eye" in the world. That
looks like a blue lotus petal and is surrounded by black eyelashes and
varied with dark and light circles. The eye \[sensitivity as meant\]
here is to be found in the place in the middle of the black circle
surrounded by the white circle in that \[feature of the\] eye with its
accessories where there appears the image of the bodies of those who
stand in front of it. It pervades the eye's seven layers like oil
sprinkled on seven layers of cotton. It is assisted by the four primary
elements whose \[respective\] functions are upholding, cohering,
maturing, and moving, as a warrior prince is by four nurses whose
functions are holding, bathing, dressing, and fanning. It is
consolidated by temperature, consciousness, and nutriment; it is
maintained by life; it is fu rnished with colour, odour, flavour, etc.
(see Ch. XVIII, §5); it is the size of a mere louse's head; and it duly
serves both as physical basis and as door for eye-consciousness, and the
rest \[of the consciousness of the cognitive series\]. \[446\]



[48.]And this is said by the General of the Dhamma:



"The sensitivity with which he sees a visible object\
Is small and it is subtle, too, no bigger, than a louse's head."(?)



[49.]The *ear* \[sensitivity\] is to be found
inside the \[feature of the\] ear-hole with its accessories in the place
that is shaped like a finger-stall and surrounded by fine brown hairs.
It is assisted by the elements in the way aforesaid. It is consolidated
by temperature, consciousness, and nutriment; it is maintained by life;
it is equipped with colour, etc.; and it duly serves both as physical
basis and as door for ear-consciousness, and the rest.



[50.] *3.* The *nose* \[sensitivity\] is to be found inside the
\[feature of the\] nose-hole with its accessories in the place shaped
like a goat's hoof. It has assistance, consolidation and maintenance in
the way aforesaid; and it duly serves both as physical basis and as door
for nose-consciousness, and the rest.



[51.] The *tongue* \[sensitivity\] is to be found
in the middle of the \[feature of the\] tongue with its accessories in
the place shaped like a lotus petal tip. It has assistance,
consolidation and maintenance in the way aforesaid; and it duly serves
both as physical basis and as door for tongue-consciousness, and the
rest.



apprehending and definition, which occur later in the cognitive series
of ear- consciousness, that there comes to be the assumption
*(abhimāna) * 'Heard faintly is heard later.' But that sound comes into
the ear's focus at the moment of its own existence and in dependence on
the place where it arises (see XIII. 112; Dhs-a 313). If there is
absolutely no successive becoming of sound, how does an echo arise? The
sound, though it remains at a distance, is a condition for the arising
of an echo and for the vibration of vessels, etc., elsewhere as a magnet
*(ayo-kanta)* is for the movement of iron" (Vism-mhṭ 446--47).

[52.] *5.* The *body* \[sensitivity\] is to be found
everywhere, like a liquid that soaks a layer of cotton, in this physical
body where there is matter that is clung to.23 It has assistance,
consolidation and maintenance in the way aforesaid too; and it duly
serves both as physical basis and as door for body-consciousness, and
the rest.



[53.]Like snakes, crocodiles, birds, dogs, and jackals that
gravitate to their own respective resorts, that is to say,
termite-mounds, water, space, villages, and charnel grounds, so the eye,
etc., should be regarded as gravitating to their own respective resorts,
that is to say, visible data, and so on (cf. Dhs-a 314).



[54.] *6. * As regards visible data, etc., which come next, a
*visible datum* has the characteristic of impinging on the eye. Its
function is to be the objective field of eye-consciousness. It is
manifested as the resort of that too. Its proximate cause is the four
great primaries. And all the \[following\] kinds of derived materiality
are the same as this. Where there is a difference we shall mention it.
This \[visible datum\] is of various kinds as "blue, yellow" (Dhs §617)
and so on.



[55.] *7.* Sound has the characteristic of impinging on the
ear. Its function is to be the object of ear-consciousness. It is
manifested as the resort of that too. It is of various kinds as "drum
sound, tabour sound" (Dhs §621) and so on. \[447\]



[56.] *8.* *Odour* has the characteristic of impinging on the
nose. Its function is to be the object of nose-consciousness. It is
manifested as the resort of that too. It is of various kinds as "root
odour, heartwood odour" (Dhs §625) and so on.



[57.] *9.* *Flavour* has the characteristic of impinging on the
tongue. Its function is to be the object of tongue-consciousness. It is
manifested as the resort of that too. It is of various kinds as "root
flavour, trunk flavour" (Dhs §629) and so on.



[58.] The *femininity faculty* has the female sex
as its characteristic. Its function is to show that "this is a female."
It is manifested as the reason for the mark, sign, work, and ways of the
female (cf. Dhs §633).



*11.* The *masculinity faculty* has the male sex as its characteristic.
Its function is to show that "this is a male." It is manifested as the
reason for the mark, sign, work, and ways of the male (cf. Dhs §634).



Both these last are coextensive with the whole body, as body-sensitivity
is. But it does not follow that they have to be called either "located
in the space where body-sensitivity is located" or "located in the space
where that is not located." Like the natures of visible data, etc.,
these are not confoundable one with the other.24



23\. *Upādiṇṇa * (also *upādiṇṇaka) * is pp. of *upādiyati * (he
clings), from which the noun *upādāna * (clinging)* * also comes.
*Upādiṇṇa-(ka-)rūpa * (clung-to matter) = *kammaja-rūpa\
*(kamma-born matter): see Dhs §653. It is vaguely renderable by "organic
or sentient or living matter"; technically, it is matter of the four
primaries that is "clung to" *(upādiṇṇa)* or "derived" *(upādāya)* by
kamma. Generally taken as a purely Abhidhamma term (Dhs 1), it
nevertheless occurs in the Suttas at M I 185 in the same sense.



24\. Ee reads *añnamaññaṃ saṅkaro natthi.* Ae omits *saṅkaro natthi.*
The word *saṅkara* in the sense of "confounding" or "error" is not in
PED; see Vism concluding verses, PTS ed., p.711:

[59.] The *life faculty* has the characteristic
of maintaining conascent kinds of matter. Its function is to make them
occur. It is manifested in the establishing of their presence. Its
proximate cause is primary elements that are to be sustained. And
although it has the capacity consisting in the characteristic of
maintaining, etc., yet it only maintains conascent kinds of matter at
the moment of presence, as water does lotuses and so on. Though states
(*dhamma*) arise due to their own conditions, it maintains them, as a
wet-nurse does a prince. And it occurs itself only through its
connection with the states that occur, like a pilot; it does not cause
occurrence after dissolution, because of its own absence and that of
what has to be made to occur. It does not prolong presence at the moment
of dissolution because it is itself dissolving, like the flame of a lamp
when the wick and the oil are getting used up. But it must not be
regarded as destitute of power to maintain, make occur, and make
present, because it does accomplish each of these functions at the
moment stated (cf. Dhs §635).25



"Though these things, that is to say, the 'mark ... of the female,'
etc., arise each due to its own condition consisting in kamma, etc.,
they mostly only do so as modes in a continuity accompanied by the
femininity faculty. And so 'it is manifested as the reason for the
mark,' etc., is said making the femininity faculty their cause. "As
regards the 'mark of the female,' etc., too, its 'facultiness' is stated
as predominance, in other words, as a state of cause, because the
conditions for the modal matter (*ākāra-rūpa*) consisting of the mark of
the female, etc., in a continuity accompanied by faculties do not arise
otherwise, and because these kinds of materiality are a condition for
apprehending the female. But because the femininity faculty does not
generate even the material instances in its own group or maintain or
consolidate them, and because it does not so act for the material
instances of other groups, it is therefore not called in the text
faculty, presence, and non-disappearance conditions, as the life faculty
is for the material instances of its group, and as nutriment is for the
material instances in succeeding groups. And it is because the mark,
etc., are dependent on other conditions that wherever they have
predominance its shape is encountered, even in dead and sculptured
matter that resembles it. And so too with the masculinity faculty. "And
since these two do not occur together in a single continuity, because of
the words, 'Does the masculinity faculty arise in one in whom the
femininity faculty arises?---No' (Yamaka), etc., therefore even in a
hermaphrodite there is only one of them at a given moment (see also
Dhs-a 323)" (Vism-mhṭ 448).



25\. "Since the life faculty is itself entirely kamma-born it is
established, by taking them as conascent, that the things to be
protected by it are kamma-born too; this is why there is no inclusion of
the term 'kamma-born.' It maintains as if it were its own that
kamma-born matter by being the cause of its occurrence even though only
lasting for a moment; that is why it has the characteristic of
maintaining conascent kinds of matter. For kamma alone is not competent
to be the cause of kamma-born things" presence, as nutriment, etc., are
of the nutriment-born. Why? Because it is no longer existent at that
moment.\
"'Because it does accomplish each of those functions': it does so
because it is a condition for distinguishing what is living. For it is
the life faculty that distinguishes matter that is bound up with
faculties from dead matter, and kamma-born matter and what is bound up
with that from matter that is temperature originated, and so on.

[60.] The heart-basis has the characteristic of
being the (material) support for the mind-element and for the
mind-consciousness-element. Its function is to observe them. It is
manifested as the carrying of them. It is to be found in dependence on
the blood, of the kind described in the treatise on mindfulness of the
body (VIII.111), inside the heart. It is assisted by the primaries with
their functions of upholding, etc.; it is consolidated by temperature,
consciousness, and nutriment; it is maintained by life; and it serves as
physical basis for the mind-element and mind-consciousness- element, and
for the states associated with them.26



"And the life faculty must be regarded as the reason not only for
presence during a moment but also for non-interruption of connection;
otherwise death as the termination of a life span would be illogical"
(Vism-mhṭ 448).



26\. "'The heart-basis ... the support for the mind-element and for the
mind- consciousness-element': how is that to be known? (i) From
scriptures and (ii) from logical reasoning.\
"The scripture is this: 'The materiality dependent on which the
mind-element and mind-consciousness-element occur is a condition, as a
support condition, for the mind-element and the
mind-consciousness-element and what is associated therewith' (Paṭṭh
I.4). If that is so, why is it not mentioned in the Rūpakaṇḍa of the
Dhammasaṅgaṇi? (Dhs §583ff.). Its not being mentioned there is for
another reason. What is that? Non-inconsistency of the teaching. For
while eye consciousness, etc., have the eye, etc., as their respective
supports absolutely, mind-consciousness does not in the same way have
the heart-basis as its support absolutely. And the teaching in the
physical-basis dyad *(vatthu-duka)* is given by way of the material
support thus, 'There is matter that is the physical basis of
eye-consciousness, there is matter that is not the physical basis of
eye-consciousness' (Dhs §585) and so on; and if the dyads were stated by
way of what had the heart-basis absolutely as its support thus, 'There
is matter that is the physical basis of mind-consciousness' and so on,
then the object dyads *(ārammaṇa-duka)* do not fall into line: for one
cannot say: 'There is matter that is the object of mind-consciousness,
there is matter that is not the object of mind- consciousness.' So the
physical-basis dyads and object dyads being thus made inconsistent, the
teaching would lack unity, and the Master's wish was to give the
teaching here in a form that has unity. That is why the heart-basis is
not mentioned, not because it is unapprehendable.\
"(ii) But the logical reasoning should be understood in this way. In the
five constituent becoming, \[that is, in the sense sphere and
fine-material sphere,\] these two elements have as their support
produced *(nipphanna)* derived matter. Herein, since the visible- data
base, etc., and nutritive essence, are found to occur apart from what is
bound up with faculties, to make them the support would be illogical.
And since these two elements are found in a continuity that is devoid of
the femininity and masculinity faculties \[i.e. in the Brahmā-world\],
to make them the support would be illogical too. And in the case of the
life faculty that would have to have another function, so to make it the
support would be illogical too. So it is the heart-basis that remains to
be recognized as their support. For it is possible to say that these two
elements have as their support produced derived matter, since existence
is bound up with matter in the five-constituent becoming. Whatever has
its existence bound up with matter is found to have as its support
produced derived matter, as the eye-consciousness-element does. And the
distinction 'in the five-constituent becoming' is made on account of the
mind- consciousness-element; in the four-constituent becoming, \[that
is, the immaterial

[61.] *Bodily intimation* is the mode
(conformation) and the alteration (deformation) in the
consciousness-originated air element that causes the occurrence of
moving forward, etc., which mode and alteration are a condition for the
stiffening, upholding, and moving of the conascent material body.
\[448\] Its function is to display intention. It is manifested as the
cause of bodily excitement. Its proximate cause is the
consciousness-originated air element. But it is called "bodily
intimation" (*kāya- viññatti*) because it is the cause of the intimating
(*viññāpana*) of intention by means of bodily excitement, and because it
is itself intimatable through the body, in other words, through that
bodily excitement. Moving forward, etc., should be understood to occur
owing to the movement of the \[kinds of matter\] that are
temperature-born, etc., which are interlocked with the
consciousness-born kinds moved by that \[intimation\]27 (See Dhs §636).



sphere,\] there is no mind-element. Does there not follow contradiction
of the middle term  *(hetu) * because of establishing faculties as their
support? No; because that is disproved by what is seen. For these two
elements are not, as in the case of eye- consciousness, controlled by
the slackness and keenness, etc., of their physical basis; and
accordingly it is not said in the texts that they have the faculties as
their condition. Hence their having faculties as their support, in other
words, their being controlled by them, is disproved.\
"Granted that these two elements have as their support the derived
matter consisting of the heart-basis, how is it to be known that it is
kamma-originated, has an invariable function, and is to be found located
in the heart? It may be said to be kamma-originated because, like the
eye, it is the materiality of a physical basis; and because of that it
has an invariable function; because it is the materiality of a physical
basis and because it is a support for consciousness, is the meaning. It
is known that its location is there because of the heart's exhaustion
*(khijjana)* in one who thinks of anything, bringing it to mind intently
and directing his whole mind to it" (Vism-mhṭ 449--50). The word
*hadaya* (heart), used in a purely mental and not physical sense, occurs
in the definitions of the mind-element and mind-consciousness-element in
the Vibhaṅga (Vibh 88--89). The brain *(matthaluṅga), * which seems to
have been first added as the 32nd part of the body in the Paṭisambhidā
(Paṭis I 7), was ignored, and the *Visuddhimagga* is hard put to it to
find a use for it. The Piṭakas (e.g. Paṭṭh 1,4 quoted above) connect the
mind with the matter of the body without specifying.\



27\. "It is the mode and the alteration of what? Of
consciousness-originated primary elements that have the air-element in
excess of capability. What is that capability? It is the state of being
consciousness-born and the state of being derived matter. Or
alternatively, it can be taken as the mode alteration of the air
element. If that is so, then intimation is illogical as derived matter,
for there is no derived matter with a single primary as its support,
since 'matter derived from the four great primaries' (M I 53) is said.
That is not wrong. Alteration of one of the four is that of all four, as
with wealth shared among four. And excess of air element in a material
group *(kalāpa)* does not contradict the words 'of the air element'; and
excess is in capability, not in quantity, otherwise their inseparability
would be illogical. According to some it is that of the air element
only. In their opinion the state of derived matter is inapplicable
*(durupapāda)* to intimation, since the alteration of one is not that of
all. But this \[air element\] is apprehended by mind-door impulsion that
is next to the non-intimating \[apprehension\] that is next to the
apprehension of the appearance of motion in the movement of the



[]



[]



hands, and so on. There is a certain kind of alteration that is separate
from the appearance of motion. And the apprehension of the former is
next to the apprehension of the latter. How is that to be known? By the
apprehension of intention. For no apprehension of intention such as, 'He
is getting this done, it seems' is met with in the case of trees'
movements, etc., which are devoid of intention. But it is met with in
the case of hand movements and so on. Therefore there is a certain kind
of alteration that is separate from the appearance of motion, and it is
known as the 'intimator of the intention.' Also it is known by inference
that the apprehension of the alteration is next to the apprehension of
the appearance thus: The intimator intimates the meaning to be intimated
only when it is apprehended as a cause, not merely as present. For they
say accordingly:\
Sounds that have entered no objective field\
Do not awaken any kind of meaning;\
And also beings merely recognized\
As such communicate no meanings either.\
"If just the apprehension of the alteration is the reason for the
apprehension of the intention, why is there no apprehension of intention
in unapprehended communication *(saṅketa)ī* It is not only just the
apprehension of the alteration that is the reason for the apprehension
of the intention; but rather it should be taken that the apprehension of
the previously-established connection is the decisive support for this.
The stiffening, upholding, and movement are due to the air-element
associated with the alteration belonging to the intimation, is what is
said. What, is it all the air-element that does all those things? It is
not like that. For it is the air element given rise to by the seventh
impulsion that, by acquiring as its reinforcing conditions the air
elements given rise to by the preceding impulsions, moves
consciousness-originated matter by acting as cause for its successive
arisings in adjacent locations, *(desantaruppatti---*cf. Ch. VIII, n.
54) not the others. The others, however, help it by doing the stiffening
and upholding, the successive arising in adjacent locations being itself
the movement. So the instrumentality should be taken as attributed when
there is the sign \[of movement\]; otherwise there would not be
uninterestedness and momentariness of dhammas. And here the cart to be
drawn by seven yokes is given as simile in the Commentary. But when
consciousness-born matter moves, the kinds of matter born of
temperature, kamma, and nutriment move too because they are bound up
with it, like a piece of dry cow-dung thrown into a river's current.\
"Since it has been said that the apprehension of intimation is next to
the apprehension of the appearance of motion, how then, is the air
element itself as the maker of the movement accompanied by the
alteration consisting in the intimation? It is not like that. It is the
air elements given rise to by the first impulsion, etc., and which are
unable to cause movement in that way and perform only the stiffening and
upholding, that should be taken as only accompanied by the alteration
belonging to intimation. For it is the alteration coexistent with the
intention that is the intimation, because of giving rise to alteration
in whatever direction it wishes to cause the occurrence of moving
forward and so on. Taking it in this way, it is perfectly logical to say
that the origination of intimation belongs to mind-door adverting. Since
the intention possessed of the aforesaid alteration is intimated through
the apprehension of that alteration, it is said that 'Its function is to
display intention.' The air element being the cause of the motion of the
bodily intimation, is figuratively said, as a state of alteration, to be
'manifested as the cause of bodily motion.' 'Its proximate cause is the
consciousness-originated air-element' is said since the air element's
excessive function

[62.] *15.* Verbal intimation is the mode (conformation) and
the alteration (deformation) in the consciousness-originated earth
element that causes that occurrence of speech utterance which mode and
alteration are a condition for the knocking together of clung-to
matter.28 Its function is to display intention. It is manifested as the
cause of the voice in speech. Its proximate cause is the
consciousness-originated earth element. But it is called "verbal
intimation" because it is the cause of the intimating of intention by
means of the voice in speech, and because it is itself intimatable
through speech, in other words, through that voice in speech. For, just
as, on seeing a sign for water consisting of an ox skull, etc., hung up
in the forest, it is intimated that "there is water here," so too, on
noticing either the bodily shaking or the voice in speech thus, they
intimate.29 (See Dhs §637.)



[63.] The *space element* has the characteristic
of delimiting matter. Its function is to display the boundaries of
matter. It is manifested as the confines of matter; or it is manifested
as untouchedness, as the state of gaps and apertures (cf. Dhs §638). Its
proximate cause is the matter delimited. And it is on account of it that
one can say of material things delimited that "this is above, below,
around, that."



[64.] *Lightness of matter* has the
characteristic of non-slowness. Its function is to dispel heaviness of
matter. It is manifested as light transformability. Its proximate cause
is light matter (cf. Dhs §639).



*18.* *Malleability of matter* has the characteristic of
non-stiffenedness. Its function is to dispel stiffness of matter. It is
manifested as non-opposition to any kind of action. Its proximate cause
is malleable matter (cf. Dhs §640).



*19.*  *Wieldiness of matter* has the characteristic of wieldiness that
is favourable to bodily action. Its function is to dispel unwieldiness.
It is manifested as non- weakness. Its proximate cause is wieldy matter
(cf. Dhs §641).



[65.] These three, however, are not found apart from each
other. Still their difference may be understood as follows. *Lightness
of matter* is alteration of matter such as any light (agile) state in
material instances, as in one who is healthy, any



is the cause of intimating intention by movement of the body" (Vism-mhṭ
450--52). Cf. Dhs-a 83f.\



28\. *Vacībheda---*"speech utterance" is not in PED, which does not give
this use of *bheda.* Vism-mhṭ (p. 452) explains: "The function
(---'knocking together') of the vocal apparatus (---'clung-to
matter')."\



29\. "The question, 'It is the mode and the alteration of what?,' should
be handled in the same way as for bodily intimation, with this
difference: for 'next to the apprehension of the appearance of movement'
substitute 'next to the hearing of an audible sound.' And here, because
of the absence of stiffening, etc., the argument beginning, 'For it is
the air element given rise to by the seventh impulsion' does not apply;
for the sound arises together with the knocking together, and the
knocking together only applies in the case of the first impulsion, and
so on. The knocking together is the arising of groups of primaries
*(bhūta-kalāpa)* in proximity to each other due to conditions. The
movement is the progression of the successive arising in adjacent
locations. This is the difference. The earth element's knocking together
is parallel to the air element's moving as regards function" (Vism-mhṭ
452).



[]



[]



non-slowness, any manner of light transformability in them, which is
originated by conditions that prevent any disturbance of elements
capable of creating sluggishness of matter. *Malleability of matter* is
alteration of matter such as any malleable state in material instances,
as in a well-pounded hide, any pliable manner consisting in amenableness
to exercise of power over them in all kinds of work without distinction,
which \[449\] is originated by conditions that prevent any disturbance
of elements capable of creating stiffness of matter. *Wieldiness of
matter* is alteration of matter such as any wieldy state in material
instances, as in well-refined gold, any manner in them consisting in
favourableness to the work of the body, which is originated by
conditions that prevent any disturbance of elements capable of creating
unfavourableness to the work of the body.



[66.]  *Growth of matter* has the characteristic
of setting up. Its function is to make material instances emerge in the
first instance. It is manifested as launching; or it is manifested as
the completed state. Its proximate cause is grown matter.



*21.* *Continuity of matter* has the characteristic of occurrence. Its
function is to anchor. It is manifested as non-interruption. Its
proximate cause is matter that is to be anchored.



Both of these are terms for matter at its birth; but owing to difference
of mode, and according to \[different persons'\] susceptibility to
instruction, the teaching in the summary (*uddesa*) in the Dhammasaṅgaṇī
is given as "growth and continuity" (cf. Dhs §596); but since there is
here no difference in meaning, consequently in the description
(*niddesa*) of these words, "the setting up of the sense-bases is the
growth of matter" and "the growth of matter is the continuity of matter"
is said (Dhs §642, 732, 865).



[67.]And in the Commentary, after saying, "It is genesis that
is called 'setting up,' increase that is called 'growth,' occurrence
that is called 'continuity,'" this simile is given: "Genesis as setting
up is like the time when water comes up in a hole dug in a river bank;
increase as growth is like the time when it fills \[the hole\];
occurrence as continuity is like the time when it overflows." And at the
end of the simile it is said: "So what is stated? Setting up is stated
by sense-base; sense-base is stated by setting up." Consequently, it is
the first genesis of material instances that is their *setting up*; the
genesis also of others that are generated in addition to those is
*growth* since it appears in the aspect of increase; the repeated
genesis also of others that are generated in addition to those is
*continuity* since it appears in the aspect of anchoring. This is how it
should be understood to have been declared thus.



[68.]*22. Ageing* has the characteristic of maturing (ripening)
material instances. Its function is to lead on towards \[their
termination\]. It is manifested as the loss of newness without the loss
of individual essence, like oldness in paddy. Its proximate cause is
matter that is maturing (ripening). This is said with reference to the
kind of ageing that is evident through seeing alteration in teeth, etc.,
as their brokenness, and so on (cf. Dhs §644). But that of immaterial
states, which has no such \[visible\] alteration, is called hidden
ageing. And that in earth, water, rocks, the moon, the sun, etc., is
called incessant ageing. \[450\]



[]



[]



[69.]  *Impermanence of matter* has the
characteristic of complete breaking up. Its function is to make material
instances subside. It is manifested as destruction and fall (cf. Dhs
§645). Its proximate cause is matter that is completely breaking up.



[70.] *Physical nutriment* has the characteristic
of nutritive essence. Its function is to feed kinds of matter. It is
manifested as consolidating. Its proximate cause is a physical basis
that must be fed with physical food. It is a term for the nutritive
essence by means of which living beings sustain themselves (cf. Dhs
§646).



[71.]These, firstly, are the material instances that have been
handed down in the texts.30 But in the Commentary, others have been
added as follows: matter as power, matter as procreation, matter as
birth, matter as sickness; and, in the opinion of some, matter as
torpor.31



In the first place, *matter as torpor* is rejected as non-existent by
the words:



Surely thou art a sage enlightened,\
There are no hindrances in thee (Sn 541).



As to the rest, *matter as sickness* is included by ageing and by
impermanence; *matter as birth* by growth and continuity; *matter as
procreation*, by the water element; and *matter as power* by the air
element. So taken separately not even one of these exists: this was the
agreement reached.



So this derived matter of twenty-four sorts and the aforesaid matter of
the primary elements, which is of four sorts, together amount to
twenty-eight sorts, neither more nor less.



[72.]And all that \[matter of twenty-eight sorts\] is of one
kind as "not-root-cause, root-causeless, dissociated from root-cause,
with conditions, mundane, subject to cankers" (Dhs §584), and so on.



It is of two kinds as internal and external, gross and subtle, far and
near, produced (*nipphanna*) and unproduced, sensitive matter and
insensitive matter, faculty and non-faculty, clung to and not-clung to,
and so on.



[73.] Herein, the five kinds beginning with the eye are
*internal* because they occur as an integral part of the selfhood (in
oneself); the rest are *external* because they are external to that
selfhood (personality). The nine beginning with the eye and the three
elements excepting the water element, making twelve kinds in all, are to
be taken as *gross* because of impinging; the rest are *subtle* because
they are the opposite of that. What is subtle is *far* because it is
difficult to penetrate, the other is *near* because it is easy to
penetrate. The eighteen kinds of matter, that is to say, the four
elements, the thirteen beginning with the eye, and physical nutriment,
are produced because they can be discerned through their own individual
essences, having exceeded the \[purely conceptual\] states of \[matter
as\] delimitation, \[matter as\] alteration, and \[matter as\]
characteristic (see §77); the rest, being the opposite, are
*unproduced*. The five kinds beginning with the

Anurādhapura" (Vism- mhṭ 455). A long discussion on this follows in
Vism-mhṭ, not given here.

eye are *sensitive matter* through their being conditions for the
apprehension of visible data, etc., because they are, as it were, bright
like the surface of a looking glass; the rest are *insensitive matter*
because they are the opposite of that. \[451\] Sensitive matter itself,
together with the three beginning with the femininity faculty, is
*faculty* in the sense of predominance; the rest are *not-faculty*
because they are the opposite of that. What we shall later describe as
"kamma-born" (§75 and XX.27) is *clung* to because that is "clung to,"
\[that is, acquired\] by kamma. The rest are *not-clung* to because they
are the opposite of that.



[74.] Again, all matter is of three kinds according to the
visible (*sanidassana*) triad, the kamma-born triad, etc. (see Dhs 2).
Herein, as regards the gross, a visible datum is visible with impact;
the rest are invisible with impact; all the subtle kinds are invisible
without impact. So firstly it is of three kinds according to the visible
triad.



[75.]According to the kamma-born triad, etc., however, that
born from kamma is *kamma-born*; that born from a condition other than
that is *not-kamma-born*; that not born from anything is
*neither-kamma-born-nor-not-kamma-born*.



That born from consciousness is *consciousness-born*; that born from a
condition other than consciousness is *not-consciousness-born*; that not
born from anything is 
*neither-consciousness-born-nor-not-consciousness-born*.



That born from nutriment is *nutriment-born*; that born from a condition
other than that is *not-nutriment-born*; that not born from anything is
*neither-nutriment- born-nor-not-nutriment-born*.



That born from temperature is *temperature-born*; that born from a
condition other than that is *not-temperature-born*; that not born from
anything is *neither- temperature-born-nor-not-temperature-born*.



So it is of three kinds according to the kamma-born triad, and so on.



[76.]Again, it is of four kinds as seen, etc., as concrete
matter, etc., and as the physical basis tetrads, and so on.



Herein, the visible-data base is *seen* because it is the objective
field of seeing. The sound base is *heard* because it is the objective
field of hearing. The three, that is to say, odours, flavours, and
tangible data, are *sensed* (lit. contacted) because they are the
objective fields of faculties that take contiguous \[objective fields\].
The rest are *cognized* because they are the objective field of
consciousness (cognition) only. So firstly it is of four kinds according
to the seen, etc., tetrad.32



32\. *"'Sensed (muta)'* means apprehendable by sensing *(mutvā), * by
reaching; hence he said *'because they are the objective fields of
faculties that take contiguous \[objective fields\]'* (cf. §46). But
what is it that is called a tangible datum? It is the three elements,
earth, heat, and air. But why is the water element not included here? Is
not cold apprehended by touching; and that is the water element?
Certainly it is apprehended but it is not the water element. What is it
then? It is just the fire element. For there is the sensation *(buddhi)*
of cold when heat is sluggish. There is no quality that is called cold;
there is only the assumption *(abhimāna) * of coldness due to the
sluggishness of the state of heat. How is that to be known? Because of
the unreliability of the sensation of cold,



[]



[]



[77.] Here, however, "produced matter" is *concrete matter*;
the space-element is *delimiting matter*; those from "bodily intimation"
up to "wieldiness" are *matter as alteration*; birth, ageing and
dissolution are *matter as characteristic*. So it is of four kinds as
concrete matter and so on.



[78.]Here, however, what is called the materiality of the heart
is *physical basis*, *not door* (see Dhs-a 82f.); the two intimations
are *door, not physical basis*; sensitive matter is *both physical basis
and door*; the rest are *neither physical basis nor door*. So it is four
kinds according to the physical basis tetrad.



[79.]Again, it is of five kinds as born of one, born of two,
born of three, born of four, and not born of anything.



Herein, what is kamma-born only or consciousness-born only is called
*born* *of one*. Of these, materiality of the faculties, together with
the heart-basis, is kamma- born only; the two intimations are
consciousness-born only. But what is born \[now\] of consciousness and
\[now\] of temperature is called *born of two*. That is the sound base
only.33 What is born of temperature, consciousness, and nutriment



like 'beyond and not beyond.' For in hot weather, while those who stand
in the sun and go into the shade have the sensation of cold, yet those
who go to the same place from an underground cave have the sensation of
heat. And if coldness were the water element it would be found in a
single group *(kalāpa)* along with heat; but it is not so found. That is
why it may be known that coldness is not the water element. And that is
conclusive *(uttara)* for those who agree to the inseparable existence
of the primary elements; and it is conclusive too even for those who do
not agree because it is disproved by associate existence through seeing
the functions of the four primaries in a single group. It is conclusive
too for those who say that coldness is the characteristic of the air
element; for if coldness were the air element, coldness would be found
in a single group along with heat, and it is not so found. That is why
it may be known that coldness is not the air element either. But those
who hold the opinion that fluidity *(dravatā)* is the water element and
that that is apprehended by touching should be told: 'That fluidity
touched is merely the venerable ones' assumption as is the case with
shape.' For this is said by the Ancients:\
'Three elements coexisting with fluidity\
Together form what constitutes a tangible;\
That "I succeed in touching this fluidity"\
Is a common misconception in the world.\
And as a man who touches elements,\
And apprehends a shape then with his mind,\
Fancies "I really have been touching shape,"\
So too fluidity is recognized'" (Vism-mhṭ 459).\



33\. "'*The sound base only*'*: * here some say, 'The consciousness-born
is always intimative  *(saviññattika).' * The Ancients say, 'There is
sound due to the intervention *(vipphāra)* of applied thought that does
not intimate.' While depending on the word of the Great Commentary that
puts it thus, 'Intimatable (cognizable) through the ear by means of the
sound due to applied thought's intervention,' still there is also need
of the arising of consciousness-originated sound without intimation
(cognition) for because of the words, 'For the intimation (cognition) is
not due to intimating speech' (?), it arises together with sound not
intimatable (cognizable) through the ear. That



[]



[]



\[452\] is called *born of three*. But that is the three beginning with
"lightness" only. What is born from the four beginning with kamma is
called *born of four*. That is all the rest except "matter as
characteristic."



[80.]But "matter as characteristic" is called *not born of
anything*. Why? Because there is no arising of arising, and the other
two are the mere maturing and breakup of what has arisen. Though in the
passage, "The visible-data base, the sound base, the odour base, the
flavour base, the tangible-data base, the space element, the water
element, lightness of matter, malleability of matter, wieldiness of
matter, growth of matter, continuity of matter, and physical
food---these states are consciousness-originated" (cf. Dhs §667) and so
on, a state of birth \[that is, growth\] being born from somewhere can
be understood as allowable since the point of view here is the moment
when the conditions that are giving birth to the kinds of materiality
are exercising their function.



This, firstly, is the section of the detailed explanation dealing with
the



materiality aggregate.



\[THE  CONSCIOUSNESS  AGGREGATE\]



[81.]Among the remaining aggregates, however, whatever has the
characteristic of being felt34 should be understood, all taken together,
as the feeling aggregate; and whatever has the characteristic of
perceiving, all taken together, as the perception aggregate; and
whatever has the characteristic of forming, all taken together, as the
formations aggregate; and whatever has the characteristic of cognizing,
all taken together, as the consciousness aggregate. Herein, since the
rest are easy to understand when the consciousness aggregate has been



being so, there would have to be a consciousness-born sound-ennead. And
that theory is rejected by Saṅghakaras who imagine that it is
self-contradictory to say that there is sound not intimatable
(cognizable) through the ear. Others, however, do not reject the Great
Commentary's statement and they comment on its intention. How? \[They
say that\] the non-intimation (non-cognition) through the ear of the
sound activated due to applied thought's intervention is stated in the
Suttas with this intention, 'He tells by hearing with the divine ear the
subtle sound that is conascent with the intimation, originated by
applied thought, and consisting in movement of the tongue and palate,
and so on' (cf. A I 171), and that in the Paṭṭhāna (Paṭṭh 1, 7) the
state of object condition for ear-consciousness is stated with reference
to gross sound" (Vism-mhṭ 460).



34\. "'*Has the characteristic of being felt*' means that it has as its
characteristic what is felt, what is experienced as the 'taste
(stimulus)' of the object. '*Characteristic of perceiving'* means that
it has as its characteristic the perceiving of an object classed as
blue, etc., and the knowing, the apprehending, of it by arousing the
perception of it as blue, yellow, long, short, and so on. Forming
*(abhisaṅkharaṇa) * is accumulating, or it is contriving by becoming
interested. And it is because volition is basic in both of these ways
that the formations aggregate is said thus to have the *characteristic
of forming.* For in expounding the formations aggregate in the
Suttanta-Bhājaniya of the Vibhaṅga, volition was expounded by the
Blessed One thus, 'Eye-contact-born volition' (Vibh 8) and so on. '*Has
the characteristic of cognizing*' means that it has as its
characteristic that kind of knowing called apprehension of an object in
a mode in which the objective field is apprehended differently from the
mode of perceiving" (Vism-mhṭ 462).



[]



[]



understood, we shall therefore begin with the commentary on the
consciousness aggregate.



[82.] "Whatever has the characteristic of cognizing should be
understood, all taken together, as the consciousness aggregate" was said
above. And what has the characteristic of cognizing (*vijānana*)?
Consciousness (*viññāṇa*); according as it is said, "It cognizes,
friend, that is why 'consciousness' is said" (M I 292). The words
*viññāṇa* (consciousness), *citta* (mind, consciousness), and *mano*
(mind) are one in meaning.



\[THE 89 KINDS OF CONSCIOUSNESS---SEE TABLE III\]



That same \[consciousness\], though one in its individual essence with
the characteristic of cognizing, is threefold according to kind, namely,
(I) profitable, (II) unprofitable, and (III) indeterminate.35



[83.] I. Herein, the *profitable* is fourfold according to
plane, namely, (A) of the sense sphere, (B) of the fine-material sphere,
(C) of the immaterial sphere, and (D) supramundane.36



35\. *Profitable * in the sense of health, blamelessness, and pleasant
result (see Vism- mhṭ 463). *Unprofitable* in the opposite sense.
*Indeterminate* because not describable as either profitable or
unprofitable (see Vism-mhṭ 464). This is the first of the twenty- two
triads in the Abhidhamma Mātikā (Dhs 1).\
Pali has five principal words, *nāma, viññāṇa, mano, citta,* and *ceto,*
against the normal English  *consciousness * and  *mind.* While their
etymology can be looked up in the dictionary, one or two points need
noting here. *Nāma* (rendered by "mentality" when not used to refer to a
*name*) is almost confined in the sense considered to the expression
*nāma-rūpa* ("mentality-materiality") as the fourth member of the
dependent origination, where it comprises the three mental aggregates of
feeling, perception and formations, but not that of consciousness
(*viññāṇa*).  *Viññāṇa* (rendered by "consciousness") is, loosely, more
or less a synonym for *mano* and *citta*; technically, it is bare
cognition considered apart from feeling, perception or formations.
*Mano* (rendered by "mind"), when used technically, is confined to the
sixth internal base for contact (Ch. XV). *Citta* (rendered by "mind"
and "consciousness" or "\[manner of\] consciousness"), when used
technically, refers to a momentary type-situation considered as
*viññāṇa* in relation to the tone of its concomitant feeling, perception
and formations. Possibly, a better rendering would have been
"cognizance" throughout. It carries a flavour of its etymological
relative, *cetanā* ("volition"). *Ceto* (another etymological relative,
rendered by "heart"---i.e. "seat of the emotions,"---"will" or "mind"),
when used loosely is very near to *citta;* but technically it is
restricted to one or two such expressions as *ceto- vimutti*
("mind-deliverance" or "heart-deliverance").\



36\. "'Sense sphere' *(kāmāvacara):* here there are the two kinds of
sense desire *(kāma),* sense desire as basis *(vatthu-kāma) * and sense
desire as defilement *(kilesakāma). * Of these, sense desire as
\[objective\] basis particularized as the five cords of sense desire
*(pañca-kāma-guṇa* = dimensions of sensual desires), is desired
*(kāmiyati).* Sense desire\
as defilement, which is craving, desires *(kāmeti). * The sense sphere
*(kāmāvacara) * is where these two operate *(avacaranti) * together. But
what is that? It is the elevenfold sense-desire becoming, i.e. hell,
asura demons, ghosts, animals, human beings, and six sensual-sphere
heavens. So too with the fine-material sphere and the immaterial sphere,
taking "fine-material" as craving for the fine-material too, and
"immaterial" as



[]

I. A. Herein, (1)--(8) that of the *sense sphere* is eightfold, being
classified according to joy, equanimity, knowledge, and prompting, that
is to say: (1) when accompanied-by-joy it is either
associated-with-knowledge and unprompted, or (2) prompted; or (3) it is
dissociated-from-knowledge and likewise \[unprompted, or (4) prompted\];
and (5) when accompanied-by-equanimity it is either
associated-with-knowledge and prompted, or (6) unprompted; or (7) it is
dissociated-from-knowledge \[453\] and likewise \[unprompted, or (8)
prompted\].



[84.](1) When a man is happy on encountering an excellent gift
to be given, or recipient, etc., or some such cause for joy, and by
placing right view foremost that occurs in the way beginning "There is
\[merit in\] giving" (M I 288), he unhesitatingly and unurged by others
performs such merit as giving, etc., then his consciousness is
*accompanied by joy*, *associated with knowledge, and unprompted*. (2)
But when a man is happy and content in the way aforesaid, and, while
placing right view foremost, yet he does it hesitantly through lack of
free generosity, etc., or urged on by others, then his consciousness is
of the same kind as the last but *prompted*; for in this sense
"prompting" is a term for a prior effort exerted by himself or others



[85.](3) But when young children have a natural habit due to
seeing the behav- iour of relatives and are joyful on seeing bhikkhus
and at once give them whatever they have in their hands or pay homage,
then the third kind of consciousness arises. (4) But when they behave
like this on being urged by their relatives, "Give; pay homage," then
the fourth kind of consciousness arises. (5)--(8) But when the
consciousnesses are devoid of joy in these four instances through
encountering no excellence in the gift to be given, or in the recipient,
etc., or through want of any such cause for joy, then the remaining
four, which are *accompanied by equanimity*, arise.



So sense-sphere profitable \[consciousness\] should be understood as of
eight



kinds, being classed according to joy, equanimity, knowledge, and
prompting.



[86.]I. B. The consciousness of the fine-material sphere is
fivefold, being classed according to association with the jhāna factors.
That is to say, (9) the first is associated with applied thought,
sustained thought, happiness, bliss, and concentration, (10) the second
leaves out applied thought from that, (11) the third leaves out
sustained thought from that, (12) the fourth makes happiness fade away
from that, (13) the fifth is associated with equanimity and
concentration, bliss having subsided.



[87.] I. C. That of the *immaterial sphere* is fourfold by
association with the four immaterial states; for (14) the first is
associated with the jhāna of the base consisting of boundless space in
the way aforesaid, while (15)--(17) the second, third, and fourth, are
\[respectively\] associated with those of the base consisting of
boundless consciousness, and so on.



[88.]I. D. The *supramundane* is fourfold (18)--(21) by
association with the four paths.



craving for the immaterial too. It crosses over *(uttarati)* from the
world *(loka),* thus it is supramundane *(lokuttara)"* (Vism-mhṭ 464).



[]



[]



So firstly, profitable consciousness itself is of twenty-one kinds.
\[454\]



[89.] II. The *unprofitable* is one kind according to plane,
being only of the sense sphere. It is of three kinds according to root,
as (a) rooted in greed, (b) rooted in hate, and (c) rooted in delusion.



[90.]II. (a) Herein, (22)--(29) that *rooted in greed* is of
eight kinds, being classed according to joy, equanimity, \[false\] view,
and prompting, that is to say: (22) when accompanied by joy it is either
associated-with-\[false-\]view and unprompted, or (23) prompted; or (24)
it is dissociated-from-\[false-\]view and likewise \[unprompted or (25)
prompted\]; and (26) when accompanied-by-equanimity it is either
associated- with-\[false-\]view and unprompted, or (27) prompted; or
(28) it is dissociated-from- \[false-\]view and likewise \[unprompted,
or (29) prompted\].



[91.](22) When a man is happy and content in placing wrong view
foremost of the sort beginning "There is no danger in sense desires" (M
I 307),  and either enjoys sense desires with consciousness that in its
own individual essence is eager without being urged, or believes
auspicious sights, etc., have a \[real substantial\] core, then the
first kind of unprofitable consciousness arises (23); when it is with
consciousness that is sluggish and urged on, then it is the second kind
(24). But when a man is happy and content only, without placing wrong
view foremost, and indulges in sexual intercourse, or covets others'
good fortune, or steals others' goods, with consciousness that in its
own individual essence is eager without being urged, then it is the
third kind (25). When it is with consciousness that is sluggish and
urged on, then it is the fourth kind (26)--(29). But when the
consciousnesses are devoid of joy in these four instances through
encountering no excellence in the sense desires, or through want of any
such cause for joy, then the remaining four, which are accompanied by
equanimity, arise.



So that rooted in greed should be understood as of eight kinds, being
classed



according to joy, equanimity, \[false\] view and prompting.



[92.]II. (b) That *rooted in hate* is of two kinds: (30)--(31)
being *accompanied-by-grief* and  *associated-with-resentment*, it is
either *prompted* or *unprompted*. It should be understood to occur at
the times when \[consciousness\] is either keen \[if unprompted\] or
sluggish \[if prompted\] in the killing of living things, and so on.



[93.]II. (c) That *rooted in delusion* is of two kinds:
(32)--(33) being *accompanied-by- equanimity*, it is either
associated-with uncertainty or associated-with-agitation. It should be
understood to occur at the time of indecision or of distraction.



So unprofitable consciousness is of twelve kinds.



[94.]III. The *indeterminate* is of two kinds: (i) resultant
and (ii) functional. Herein, III. i. *resultant* is of four kinds
according to plane; namely, (A) of the sense sphere, (B) of the
fine-material sphere, (C) of the immaterial sphere, and (D)
supramundane. Herein, III. i. A. that of the *sense sphere* is of two
kinds, namely, (a) profitable result and (b) unprofitable result. And
III. i. A. (a) the *profitable resultant* is of two kinds, namely, (1)
without root-cause and (2) with root-cause.



[95.]III. i. A. (a) i. Herein, that *without root-cause* is
that devoid of non-greed, etc., as the cause of result. It is of eight
kinds as (34) eye-consciousness (35)--(38),



[]



[]



ear-, nose-, tongue-, and body-consciousness (39), mind-element with the
function of receiving (40)--(41), the two mind-consciousness-elements
with the functions of investigating, and so on. \[455\]



[96.]Herein, (34) *eye-consciousness* has the characteristic of
being supported by the eye and cognizing visible data. Its function is
to have only visible data as its object. It is manifested as occupation
with visible data. Its proximate cause is the departure of (70) the
functional mind-element that has visible data as its object.



(35)--(38)  *Ear-, nose-, tongue-*, and *body-consciousness*
\[respectively\] have the characteristic of being supported by the ear,
etc., and of cognizing sounds, and so on. Their functions are to have
only sounds, etc., as their \[respective\] objects. They are manifested
as occupation with \[respectively\] sounds, and so on. Their proximate
cause is the departure of (70) the functional mind-element that has
\[respectively\] sounds, etc., as its object.



[97.] (39) \[The resultant\] *mind-element* has the
characteristic of cognizing \[respectively\] visible data, etc.,
immediately next to (34)--(38) eye-consciousness, and so on. Its
function is to receive visible data, and so on. It is manifested as the
state \[of receiving\] corresponding to that \[last-mentioned
function\].37 Its proximate cause is the departure of eye-consciousness,
and so on.



(40)--(41) Also the twofold resultant *mind-consciousness-element
without root-* *cause* with the function of investigating, etc., has as
its characteristic the cognizing of the six kinds of objects. Its
function is that of investigating, and so on. It is manifested as the
state \[of investigating\] corresponding to that \[last- mentioned
function\]. Its proximate cause is the heart-basis.



[98.]But it is classed according to its association with joy or
with equanimity, and according to its being divisible into that with two
positions and that with five positions \[in the cognitive series\]. For
of these, (40) one is associated-with- joy because of its presence when
entirely desirable objects occur; and it has two positions \[in the
cognitive series\] because it occurs as investigating at the five doors
and as registration at the end of impulsion. (41) The other kind is
associated-with-equanimity because of its presence when
desirable-neutral objects occur, and it has five positions since it
occurs as investigation, registration, rebirth-linking, life-continuum,
and death.



[99.]And this eightfold resultant consciousness without
root-cause is of two kinds as well because of having an invariable
object and a variable object. It is of three kinds as classed according
to \[bodily\] pleasure, \[mental\] joy, and equanimity. For (34)--(38)
the five consciousnesses have each an invariable object since they occur
respectively only with respect to visible data, and so on. The others
(39)--(41) have a variable object. For here (39) the mind-element occurs
with respect to the five beginning with visible data, and (40)--(41) the
two mind-consciousness-elements



37\. The meaning of the expression *tathābhāva-paccupaṭṭhāna * appears
more clearly where it is used again at §108. In this definition
*(sādhana)* the function *(kicca-rasa)* in fact describes the verb
action *(kicca)* while the manifestation *(paccupaṭṭhāna)* describes the
relevant nounal state *(bhāva).* So *"tathābhāva"* means that what has
just been taken as a function (e.g. "receiving") is to be taken also as
a state ("reception").



[]



[]



occur with respect to \[all\] six. Here, however, body-consciousness is
associated with \[bodily\] pleasure. The mind-consciousness-element (40)
with two positions is associated with \[mental\] joy; the other (41) is
associated with equanimity.



So firstly, the profitable resultant without root-cause should be
understood as



of eight kinds.



[100.] III. i. A. (a) 2. But that with root-cause is (42)--(49)
that associated with non-greed, etc., as the cause of the result. It is
of eight kinds because it is classed according to joy, etc., like the
profitable of the sense sphere (1)--(8). But it does not occur with
respect to the six objects38 through giving, etc., as the profitable
does; for it occurs only with respect to the six objects that are
included among limited states,39 as rebirth-linking, life-continuum,
death, and registration. But the prompted and unprompted states should
be understood here as due to the source it has come from, and so on.40
\[456\] And while there is no difference in the associated states, the
resultant should be understood as passive like the reflection of a face
in a looking-glass while the profitable is active like the face.



[101.] III. i. A. (b) Unprofitable resultant, though, is
without root-cause only. It is of seven kinds as (50) eye-consciousness,
(51)--(54) ear-, nose-, tongue-, and body-consciousness, (55)
mind-element with the function of receiving, and (56)
mind-consciousness-element with the function of investigating, etc., and
having five positions. It should be understood as to characteristic,
etc., in the same way as the profitable resultant without root-cause
(34)--(41).



[102.] Profitable resultant, though, has desirable or
desirable-neutral objects only, while these have undesirable or
undesirable-neutral objects only. The former are of three kinds, being
classed according to equanimity, bodily pleasure, and mental joy, while
these are of two kinds, being classed according to bodily pain and
equanimity. For here it is only body-consciousness that is accompanied
by bodily pain; the rest are accompanied by equanimity. And the
equanimity in these is inferior, and not very sharp as the pain is;
while in the former it is superior, and not very sharp as the pleasure
is.



So with these seven kinds of unprofitable resultant and the previous
sixteen kinds of profitable resultant, sense-sphere resultant
consciousness is of twenty- three kinds.



38\. "To the six kinds of objects all classed as limited, etc., past,
etc., internal, etc" (Vism-mhṭ 474).\



39\. Registration consciousness does not, it is stated, occur with an
object of exalted consciousness---see Vibh-a 154.\



40\. "'*The source it has come from, and so on'* means the source it has
come from and its condition. Here, in the opinion of certain teachers
the result of the unprompted profitable is unprompted and the result of
the prompted is prompted, like the movement of the face's reflection in
a looking-glass when the face moves; thus it is *due to the source it
has come from.* But in the opinion of other teachers the unprompted
arises due to powerful kamma as condition and the prompted does so due
to weak kamma; thus it is *due to its condition*" (Vism-mhṭ 474).



[]



[]



[103.] III. i. B. That of the *fine-material sphere*, however,
is of five kinds (57)--(61) like the profitable (9)--(13). But the
profitable occurs in a cognitive series with the impulsions as an
attainment \[of jhāna\], while this occurs in an existence \[in the
fine-material sphere\] as rebirth-linking, life-continuum, and death.



[104.] III. i. C. And as that of the fine-material sphere \[was
like the profitable of that sphere\] so that of the *immaterial sphere*
(62)--(65) is of four kinds like the profitable too (14)--(17). And its
occurrence is classed in the same way as that of the fine-material
sphere.



[105.] III. i. D. The *supramundane resultant* is of four kinds
(66)--(69) because it is \[respectively\] the fruitions of the
consciousnesses associated with the four paths (18)--(21). It occurs in
two ways, that is to say, as \[fruition in\] the cognitive series of the
path and as fruition attainment (see Ch. XXII).



So resultant consciousness in all the four planes is of thirty-six
kinds.



[106.] III. ii. The functional, however, is of three kinds
according to plane: (A) of the sense sphere, (B) of the fine-material
sphere, (C) of the immaterial sphere. Herein, III. ii. A., that of the
sense sphere, is of two kinds, namely, (1) without root- cause, and (2)
with root-cause.



III\. ii. A. 1. Herein, that without root-cause is that devoid of
non-greed, etc., as the cause of result. That is of two kinds, being
classed as (70) mind-element, and (71)--(72) mind-consciousness-element.



[107.] Herein, (70) the *mind-element* has the characteristics
of being the forerunner of eye-consciousness, etc., and of cognizing
visible data and so on. Its function is to advert. It is manifested as
confrontation of visible data, and so on. Its proximate cause is the
interruption of \[the continued occurrence of consciousness as\] life-
continuum. It is associated with equanimity only.



[108.]But the mind-consciousness-element is of two kinds,
namely, shared by all and not shared by all. \[457\] Herein, (71) that
shared by all is the functional \[mind- consciousness-element\]
accompanied by equanimity without root-cause. It has the characteristic
of cognizing the six kinds of objects. Its function is to determine at
the five doors and to advert at the mind door. It is manifested as the
states \[of determining and adverting\] corresponding to those
\[last-mentioned two functions\]. Its proximate cause is the departure
either of the resultant mind-consciousness-element without root-cause
(40)--(41) \[in the first case\], or of one among the kinds of
life-continuum \[in the second\]. (72) That *not shared by all* is the
functional \[mind-consciousness- element\] accompanied by joy without
root-cause. It has the characteristic of cognizing the six kinds of
objects. Its function is to cause smiling41 in Arahants about things
that are not sublime. It is manifested as the state corresponding to
that \[last-mentioned function\]. Its proximate cause is always the
heart-basis.



So the sense-sphere functional without root-cause is of three kinds.



[109.] III. ii. A. 2. That, however, *with root cause* is of
eight kinds (73)--(80), like the



profitable (1)--(8), being classed according to joy and so on. While the
profitable



41\. "With respect to such unsublime objects as the forms of skeletons
or ghosts" (Vism-mhṭ 476). See e.g. Vin III 104.



[]



[]



arises in trainers and ordinary men only, this arises in Arahants only.
This is the difference here.



So firstly, that of the sense sphere is of eleven kinds.



III\. ii. B., III. ii. C. That, however, of the *fine-material sphere*
(81)--(85), and that of the  *immaterial sphere* (86)--(89) are
\[respectively\] of five kinds and of four kinds like the profitable.
But they should be understood to differ from the profitable in that they
arise only in Arahants.



So functional consciousness in the three planes is of twenty kinds in
all.



[110.] So the 21 kinds of profitable, the 12 kinds of
unprofitable, the 36 kinds of resultant, and the 20 kinds of functional,
amount in all to 89 kinds of consciousness. And these occur in the
fourteen modes of (a) rebirth-linking, (b) life-continuum, (c)
adverting, (d) seeing, (e) hearing, (f) smelling, (g) tasting, (h)
touching, (i) receiving, (j) investigating, (k) determining, (l)
impulsion, (m) registration, and (n) death.



\[THE 14 MODES OF OCCURRENCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS\]



[111.]How so? (a) When, through the influence of the eight
kinds of sense-sphere profitable \[consciousness\] (1)--(8), beings come
to be reborn among deities and human beings, then the eight kinds of
sense-sphere resultant with root-cause (42)-- (49) occur, and also the
resultant mind-consciousness-element without root-cause associated with
equanimity (41), which is the weak profitable result with two root-
causes in those who are entering upon the state of eunuchs, etc., among
human beings---thus nine kinds of resultant consciousness in all occur
as rebirth-linking; and they do so making their object whichever among
the kamma, sign of kamma, or sign of destiny has appeared at the time of
dying (see also XVII.120).42



[112.] When, through the influence of the profitable of the
fine-material sphere (9)--(13) and the immaterial sphere (14)--(17),
beings are reborn \[respectively\] in the fine-material and immaterial
kinds of becoming, then the nine kinds of fine- material (57)--(61) and
immaterial (62)--(65) resultant occur as *rebirth-linking*; and they do
so making their object only the sign of kamma that has appeared at the
time of dying.43



[113.] When, through the influence of the unprofitable
(22)--(33), they are reborn in a state of loss, then the one kind of
unprofitable resultant mind-consciousness- element without root-cause
(56) occurs as rebirth-linking; and it does so making its object
whichever among the kamma, sign of kamma, and sign of destiny has
appeared at the time of dying. \[458\]



42\. See also M-a IV 124f. "Here *'kamma'* is stored-up profitable kamma
of the sense sphere that has got an opportunity to ripen; hence he said
'*that* *has appeared.' 'Sign of kamma'* is the gift to be given that
was a condition for the volition at the moment of accumulating the
kamma. *'Sign of destiny'* is the visible-data base located in the
destiny in which he is about to be reborn" (Vism-mhṭ 477). See XVII.
136ff.



43\. "'*The sign of kamma*" here is only the kamma's own object
consisting of an earth kasiṇa, etc" (Vism-mhṭ 478).



[]



[]



This firstly is how the occurrence of nineteen kinds of resultant
consciousness



should be understood as rebirth-linking.



[114.](b) When the rebirth-linking consciousness has ceased,
then, following on whatever kind of rebirth-linking it may be, the same
kinds, being the result of that same kamma whatever it may be, occur as
life-continuum consciousness with that same object; and again those same
kinds.44 And as long as there is no other kind of arising of
consciousness to interrupt the continuity, they also go on occurring
endlessly in periods of dreamless sleep, etc., like the current of a
river.45



This is how the occurrence of those same \[nineteen kinds of\]
consciousness



should be understood as life-continuum.



[115.] (c) With the life-continuum continuity occurring thus,
when living beings' faculties have become capable of apprehending an
object, then, when a visible datum has come into the eye's focus, there
is impinging upon the eye-sensitivity due to the visible datum.
Thereupon, owing to the impact's influence, there comes to be a
disturbance in \[the continuity of\] the life-continuum.46 Then, when
the life-continuum has ceased, the functional mind-element (70) arises
making that same visible datum its object, as it were, cutting off the
life-continuum and accomplishing the function of *adverting*. So too in
the case of the ear door and so on.



[116.] When an object of anyone of the six kinds has come into
focus in the mind door, then next to the disturbance of the
life-continuum the functional mind- consciousness-element without
root-cause (71) arises accompanied by



44\. "'*With that same object'*:* * if kamma is the life-continuum's
object, then it is that kamma; if the sign of the kamma, or the sign of
the destiny, then it is one of those" (Vism-mhṭ 478).\



45\. "'*Occurring endlessly'*: this is, in fact, thus called
*'bhavaṅga'* (life-continuum, lit. 'limb' (or 'practice'---see II. 11)
of becoming) because of its occurring as the state of an *aṅga* ('limb'
or 'practice') of the rebirth-process becoming *(uppatti-bhava)"*
(Vism-mhṭ 478).\
For the commentarial description of dream consciousness and kamma
effected during dreams, see Vibh-a (commentary to Ñāṇa-Vibhaṅga, Ekaka)
and A-a, (commentary to AN 5:196) which largely but not entirely
overlap. Vism-mhṭ says here: "The seeing of dreams is done with
consciousness consisting only of the functional" (Vism-mhṭ 478).\



46\. "'*A disturbance in the life-continuum*'* * is a wavering of the
life-continuum consciousness; the meaning is that there is the arrival
at a state that is a reason for dissimilarity in its occurrence twice in
that way. For it is called disturbance *(calana)* because it is like a
disturbance (movement) since there seems to be a cause for an occasion 
*(avatthā) * in the mind's continuity different from the previous
occasion. Granted, firstly, that there is impact on the sensitivity
owing to confrontation with an object, since the necessity for that is
established by the existence of the objective field and the possessor of
the objective field, but how does there come to be disturbance
(movement) of the life-continuum that has a different support? Because
it is connected with it. And here the example is this: when grains of
sugar are put on the surface of a drum and one of the grains of sugar is
tapped, a fly sitting on another grain of sugar moves" (Vism-mhṭ 478).



[]



[]



equanimity, as it were, cutting off the life-continuum and accomplishing
the function of adverting.



This is how the occurrence of two kinds of functional consciousness
should



be understood as *adverting*.



[117.] (d)--(h) Next to adverting,47 taking the eye door first,
*eye-consciousness* (d) arises accomplishing the function of *seeing* in
the eye door and having the eye- sensitivity as its physical basis. And
\[likewise\] (e) *ear-*, (f) *nose-*, (g) *tongue-*, and (h) 
*body-consciousness* arise, accomplishing respectively the functions of
*hearing*, etc., in the ear door and so on.



These comprise the profitable resultant \[consciousnesses\] (34)--(38)
with respect to desirable and desirable-neutral objective fields, and
the unprofitable resultant (50)--(54) with respect to undesirable and
undesirable-neutral objective fields.



This is how the occurrence of ten kinds of resultant consciousness
should be



understood as seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and touching.



[118.] (i) Because of the words, "Eye-consciousness having
arisen and ceased, next to that there arises consciousness, mind,
mentation ... which is appropriate mind-element" (Vibh 88), etc., next
to eye-consciousness, etc., and *receiving* the same objective fields as
they \[deal with\], mind-element arises as (39) profitable resultant
next to profitable resultant \[eye-consciousness, etc.,\] and as (55)
unprofitable resultant next to \[459\] unprofitable resultant
\[eye-consciousness, and so on\].



This is how the occurrence of two kinds of resultant consciousness
should be



understood as receiving.



[119.](j) Because of the words, "Mind-element having arisen and
ceased, also, next to that there arises consciousness, mind, mentation
... which is appropriate mind-element" (Vibh 89),48 then resultant
mind-consciousness-element without root-cause arises *investigating* the
same objective field as that received by the mind-element. When next to
(55) unprofitable-resultant mind-element it is (56)
unprofitable-resultant, and when next to (39) profitable-resultant
\[mind-element\] it is either (40) accompanied by joy in the case of a
desirable object, or (41) accompanied by equanimity in the case of a
desirable-neutral object.



This is how the occurrence of three kinds of resultant consciousness
should



be understood as investigating.



[120.] (k) Next to investigation, (71) functional
mind-consciousness-element without root-cause arises accompanied by
equanimity determining that same objective field.



47\. "'*Next to adverting*'* * means next to five-door adverting. For
those who do not admit the cognitive series beginning with receiving,
just as they do not admit the heart basis, the Pali has been handed down
in various places in the way beginning, 'For the eye-consciousness
element as receiving *(sampaṭicchanāya cakkhuviññāṇa- dhātuyā)'* (see
Ch. IV, n. 13); for the Pali cannot be contradicted" (Vism-mhṭ 479). The
quotation as it stands is not traced to the Piṭakas.\



48\. See Ch. IV, note 13.



[]



[]



This is how the occurrence of one kind of resultant consciousness should
be



understood as determining.



[121.] (l) Next to determining, if the visible datum, etc., as
object is vivid,49 then six or seven *impulsions* impel with respect to
the objective fields as determined. These are one among (1)--(8) the
eight kinds of sense-sphere profitable, or (22)-- (33) the twelve kinds
of unprofitable, or (72)--(80) the nine remaining sense- sphere
functional. This, firstly, is the way in the case of the five doors.



But in the case of the mind door those same \[impulsions arise\] next to
(71)



mind-door adverting.



Beyond \[the stage of\] change-of-lineage50 any \[of the following 26
kinds of impulsion\] that obtains a condition51 impels; that is, any
kind among (9)--(13) the five profitable, and (81)--(85) the five
functional, of the fine-material sphere, and (14)--(17) the four
profitable, and (86)--(89) the four functional of the immaterial sphere,
and also (18)--(21) the four path consciousnesses and (66)-- (69) four
fruition consciousnesses of the supramundane.



This is how the occurrence of fifty-five kinds of profitable,
unprofitable,



functional, and resultant consciousness should be understood as
impulsion.



[122.] (m) At the end of the impulsions, if the object is a
very vivid one52 in the five doors, or is clear in the mind door, then
in sense-sphere beings at the end of sense-sphere impulsions resultant
consciousness occurs through any condition it may have obtained such as
previous kamma, impulsion consciousness, etc., with desirable, etc.,
object.53 \[It occurs thus\] as one among the eight sense-sphere
resultant kinds with root cause (42)--(49) or the three resultant mind-
consciousness elements without root-cause (40), (41), (56), and it
\[does so\] twice



49\. "'*If ... vivid (lit. large)':* this is said because it is the
occurrence of consciousness at the end of the impulsions that is being
discussed. For an object is here intended as 'vivid' when its life is
fourteen conscious moments; and that should be understood as coming into
focus when it has arisen and is two or three moments past" (Vism-mhṭ
479).



50\. "This includes also the preliminary-work and the cleansing (see Ch.
XXII, note 7), not change-of-lineage only" (Vism-mhṭ 479). See also
IV.74 and XXI. 129.



51\. "'*That obtains a condition':* any impulsion that has obtained a
condition for arising next to change-of-lineage, as that of the
fine-material sphere, and so on" (Vism-mhṭ 479).



52\. "'*A very vivid one*' is one with a life of sixteen conscious
moments. For registration consciousness arises with respect to that, not
with respect to any other. *'Clear'* means very evident, and that is
only in the sense sphere; for registration arises with respect to that"
(Vism-mhṭ 479).\



53\. "'*Previous kamma*'*: * this is said in order to show the
differences in kinds of registration; for kamma that generates
rebirth-linking is not the only kind to generate registration; other
kinds of kamma do so too. But the latter generates registration unlike
that generatable by the kamma that generates rebirth-linking.
*'Impulsion consciousness':* this is said in order to show what defines
the registration; for it is said, 'Registration is definable by
impulsion' (?). The word 'etc.' includes rebirth-linking, however; for
that is not a condition for registration that is more outstanding than
itself. *'Any condition':* any condition from among the desirable
objects, etc., that has combined *(samaveta)* to produce the arising of
registration" (Vism-mhṭ 479).

or \[460\] once, following after the impulsions that have impelled, and
with respect to an object other than the life-continuum's object, like
some of the water that follows a little after a boat going upstream.
Though ready to occur with the life- continuum's object after the
impulsions have ended, it nevertheless occurs making the impulsions'
object its object. Because of that it is called *registration*
(*tadārammaṇa---*lit. "having-that-as-its-object").



This is how the occurrence of eleven kinds of resultant consciousness
should



be understood as registration.



[123.] (n) At the end of registration the life-continuum
resumes its occurrence. When the \[resumed occurrence of the\]
life-continuum is again interrupted, adverting, etc., occur again, and
when the conditions obtain, the conscious continuity repeats its
occurrence as adverting, and next to adverting seeing, etc., according
to the law of consciousness, again and again, until the life-continuum
of one becoming is exhausted. For the last life-continuum consciousness
of all in one becoming is called death (*cuti*) because of falling
(*cavanatta*) from that \[becoming\]. So that is of nineteen kinds too
\[like rebirth-linking and life- continuum\].



This is how the occurrence of nineteen kinds of resultant consciousness
should



be understood as death.



[124.] And after death there is rebirth-linking again; and
after rebirth-linking, life-continuum. Thus the conscious continuity of
beings who hasten through the kinds of becoming, destiny, station \[of
consciousness\], and abode \[of beings\] occurs without break. But when
a man attains Arahantship here, it ceases with the cessation of his
death consciousness.



This is the section of the detailed explanation dealing with the
consciousness



aggregate.



\[THE  FEELING  AGGREGATE\]



[125.] Now, it was said above, "Whatever has the characteristic
of being felt should be understood, all taken together, as the feeling
aggregate" (§81). And here too, what is said to have the characteristic
of being felt is feeling itself, according as it is said, "It is felt,
friend, that is why it is called feeling" (M I 293).



[126.] But though it is singlefold according to its individual
essence as the characteristic of being felt, it is nevertheless
threefold as to kind, that is to say, profitable, unprofitable, and
indeterminate. Herein, it should be understood that when associated with
the profitable consciousness described in the way beginning "(1)--(8)
That of the sense sphere is eight-fold, being classified according to
joy, equanimity, knowledge, and prompting" (§83), it is profitable;54



54\. "This should be regarded as a secondary characteristic
*(upalakkhaṇa)* of profitable feeling, that is to say, the fact that
whatever profitable feeling there is, is all associated with profitable
consciousness. That, however, is not for the purpose of establishing its
profitableness. For the profitableness of profitable feeling is not due
to its association with profitable consciousness, but rather to wise
attention and so on. That is why he said *'as to kind.'* So too in the
case of the unprofitable and so on" (Vism-mhṭ 481).



[]



[]



that associated with unprofitable consciousness is unprofitable; that
associated with indeterminate consciousness is *indeterminate*. \[461\]



[127.] It is fivefold according to the analysis of its
individual essence into \[bodily\]



pleasure, \[bodily\] pain, \[mental\] joy, \[mental\] grief, and
equanimity.



Herein,  *pleasure* is associated with profitable resultant
body-consciousness (38) and pain with unprofitable resultant
body-consciousness (54). *Joy* is associated with 62 kinds of
consciousness, namely, as to sense sphere, with 4 kinds of profitable
(1)--(4), with 4 resultant with root-cause (42)--(45), with 1 resultant
without root-cause (40), with 4 functional with root-cause (73)--(76),
with 1 functional without root-cause (72), and with 4 unprofitable
(22)--(25); and as to the fine-material-sphere, with 4 kinds of
profitable (9)--(12), 4 resultant (57)--(60), and 4 functional
(81)--(84), leaving out that of the fifth jhāna in each case; but there
is no supramundane without jhāna and consequently the \[eight\] kinds of
supramundane (18)--(21) and (66)--(69) multiplied by the five jhāna make
forty; but leaving out the eight associated with the fifth jhāna, it is
associated with the remaining 32 kinds of profitable resultant. Grief is
associated with two kinds of unprofitable (30)--(31). *Equanimity* is
associated with the remaining fifty-five kinds of consciousness.



[128.] Herein, *pleasure* has the characteristic of
experiencing a desirable tangible datum. Its function is to intensify
associated states. It is manifested as bodily enjoyment. Its proximate
cause is the body faculty.



*Pain* has the characteristic of experiencing an undesirable tangible
datum. Its function is to wither associated states. It is manifested as
bodily affliction. Its proximate cause is the body faculty.



*Joy* has the characteristic of experiencing a desirable object. Its
function is to exploit55 in one way or another the desirable aspect. It
is manifested as mental enjoyment. Its proximate cause is tranquillity.



*Grief* has the characteristic of experiencing an undesirable object.
Its function is to exploit in one way or another the undesirable aspect.
It is manifested as mental affliction. Its proximate cause is invariably
the heart-basis.



*Equanimity* has the characteristic of being felt as neutral. Its
function is not to intensify or wither associated states much. It is
manifested as peacefulness. Its proximate cause is consciousness without
happiness.56



55\. *Sambhoga---"exploiting":* not in this sense in PED (see also
XVII.51).



56\. "Pleasure and pain respectively gratify and afflict by acting in
one way on the body and in another way on the mind, but not so
equanimity, which is why the latter is described as of one class.\
"Just as, when a man places a piece of cotton wool on an anvil and
strikes it with an iron hammer, and his hammer goes right through the
cotton and hits the anvil, the violence of the blow is great, so too
because the violence of the impact's blow is great, body-consciousness
is accompanied by pleasure when the object is a desirable or
desirable-neutral one, and by pain when the object is an undesirable or
undesirable- neutral one. \[It is the impact of primary matter (tangible
object) on the primaries of the body.\]



[]



[]



This is the section of the detailed explanation dealing with the feeling



aggregate.



\[THE  PERCEPTION  AGGREGATE\]



[129.] Now, it was said above, "Whatever has the characteristic
of perceiving should be understood, all taken together, as the
perception aggregate" (§81). And here too, what is said to have the
characteristic of perceiving is perception itself, according as it is
said, "It perceives, friend, that is why it is called perception" (M I
293).



But though it is singlefold according to its individual essence as the
characteristic of perceiving, it is nevertheless threefold as to kind,
that is to say, profitable, unprofitable, and indeterminate. Herein,
\[462\] that associated with profitable consciousness is *profitable*,
that associated with unprofitable consciousness is *unprofitable*, that
associated with indeterminate consciousness is indeterminate. Since
there is no consciousness dissociated from perception, perception
therefore has the same number of divisions as consciousness \[that is to
say, eighty-nine\].



[130.] But though classed in the same way as consciousness,
nevertheless, as to characteristic, etc., it all has just the
characteristic of perceiving. Its function is to make a sign as a
condition for perceiving again that "this is the same," as carpenters,
etc., do in the case of timber, and so on. It is manifested as the
action of interpreting by means of the sign as apprehended, like the
blind who "see" an elephant (Ud 68--69). Its proximate cause is an
objective field in whatever way that appears, like the perception that
arises in fawns that see scarecrows as men.



This is the section of the detailed explanation dealing with the
perception



aggregate.



\[THE FORMATIONS AGGREGATE---SEE TABLES II & IV\]



[131.] Now, it was said above, "Whatever has the characteristic
of forming should be understood, all taken together, as the formations
aggregate" (§81). And here too, what is said to have the characteristic
of forming is that which has the characteristic of agglomerating.57 What
is that? It is formations themselves, according as it is said, "They
form the formed, bhikkhus, that is why they are called formations" (S
III 87).



[132.] They have the characteristic of forming. Their function
is to accumulate.



They are manifested as intervening.58 Their proximate cause is the
remaining



"Herein, though profitable-resultant and unprofitable-resultant
consciousness discriminated according to the desirable and undesirable
might logically be associated with pleasure and pain, nevertheless the
eight kinds of consciousness that have the eye, etc., as their support
((34)--(37) and (50)--(53)) are invariably associated only with
equanimity, because of the gentleness of the impact's blow in the case
of two instances of derived matter, like that of two pieces of cotton
wool" (Vism-mhṭ 482). For a simile see Dhs-a 263.



57\. "'*The characteristic of agglomerating*' means the characteristic
of adding together *(sampiṇḍana);* then they are said to have the
function of accumulating, for the dhammas in the formations aggregate
are so described because volition is their basis" (Vism- mhṭ 484).



[]



[]



three \[immaterial\] aggregates. So according to characteristic, etc.,
they are singlefold. And according to kind they are threefold, namely,
(I) profitable, (II) unprofitable, and (III) indeterminate. As regards
these, when associated with profitable consciousness they are
profitable, when associated with unprofitable consciousness they are
unprofitable, when associated with indeterminate consciousness they are
indeterminate.



\[ACCORDING TO ASSOCIATION WITH CONSCIOUSNESS\]



[133.] I. (1) Herein, firstly, those associated with the first
sense-sphere profitable consciousness (1) amount to thirty-six, that is
to say, the constant ones, which are the twenty-seven given in the texts
as such, and the four "or-whatever- states,"59 and also the five
inconstant ones (cf. Dhs §1).



Herein, the twenty-seven given as such are these:



[(i)]



contact,



[(ii)]



volition,



[(iii)]



applied thought, \[463\]



[(iv)]



sustained thought,



[(v)]



happiness (interest),



[(vi)]



energy,



[(vii)]



life,



[(viii)]



concentration,



[(ix)]



faith,



[(x)]



mindfulness,



[(xi)]



conscience,



[(xii)]



shame,



[(xiii)]



non-greed,



[(xiv)]



non-hate,



[(xv)]



non-delusion,



[(xvi)]



tranquillity of the \[mental\] body,



[(xvii)]



tranquillity of consciousness,



[(xviii)]



lightness of the \[mental\] body,



[(xix)]



lightness of consciousness,



[(xx)]



malleability of the \[mental\] body,



[(xxi)]



malleability of consciousness,



[(xxii)]



wieldiness of the \[mental\] body,



[(xxiii)]



wieldiness of consciousness,



[(xxiv)]



proficiency of the \[mental\] body,



[(xxv)]



proficiency of consciousness,



[(xxvi)]



rectitude of the \[mental) body,



58\. *Vipphāra---*"intervening" here is explained by Vism-mhṭ (p. 484)
as *vyāpāra* (interest or work); not in this sense in PED. See Ch. VI,
note 6.



59\. *Yevāpanaka (ye-vā-pana-ka)* is commentarial shorthand derived from
the Dhammasaṇgaṇī phrase *"ye-vā-pana tasmiṃ samaye aññe pi atthi
paṭiccasamuppannā arūpino dhammā*"---"Or whatever other immaterial
conditionally-arisen states (phenomena) there are too on that occasion"
(Dhs 1). Cf. also M I 85.



[]

[(xxvii)]



rectitude of consciousness.



The four 'or-whatever-states' are these:



[(xxviii)]



zeal (desire),



[(xxix)]



resolution,



[(xxx)]



attention (bringing to mind),



[(xxxi)]



specific neutrality.



And the five inconstant are these:



[(xxxii)]



compassion,



[(xxxiii)]



gladness,



[(xxxiv)]



abstinence from bodily misconduct,



[(xxxv)]



abstinence from verbal misconduct,



[(xxxvi)]



abstinence from wrong livelihood.



These last arise sometimes \[but not always\], and when they arise they
do not



do so together.



[134.] Herein, (i) it touches (*phusati*), thus it is contact
(*phassa*). This has the characteristic of touching. Its function is the
act of impingement. It is manifested as concurrence. Its proximate cause
is an objective field that has come into focus.



\[As to its characteristic\], although this is an immaterial state, it
occurs with respect to an object as the act of touching too.60 And \[as
to its function\], although it is not adherent on anyone side61 as
eye-cum-visible-object and ear-cum-sound are, yet it is what makes
consciousness and the object impinge. It is said to be manifested as
concurrence because it has been described as its own action, namely, the
concurrence of the three \[(cf. M I 111), that is, eye, visible object,
and eye-consciousness\]. And it is said to have as its proximate cause
an objective field that has come into focus because it arises
automatically through the appropriate \[conscious\] reaction and with a
faculty when the objective field is presented. But it should be regarded
as like a hideless cow (S II 99) because it is the habitat62 of feeling.



[135.] (ii) It wills (*cetayati*), thus it is *volition*
(*cetanā*); it collects, is the meaning.



Its characteristic is the state of willing. Its function is to
accumulate. It is



60\. "'*As the act of touching too':* by this he shows that this is its
individual essence even though it is immaterial. And the characteristic
of touching is obvious in its occurrence in such instances as, say, the
watering of the mouth in one who sees another tasting vinegar or a ripe
mango, the bodily shuddering in a sympathetic person who sees another
being hurt, the trembling of the knees in a timid man standing on the
ground when he sees a man precariously balanced on a high tree branch,
the loss of power of the legs in one who sees something terrifying such
as a *pisāca* (goblin)" (Vism-mhṭ 484--85).



61\. For "non-adherent" see §46. "'*On any one side'* means on any one
side of itself, like a pair of planks and so on. *'Non-adherent'* means
not sticking *(asaṃsilissamāna).* It is only the impact without
adherence that contact shares with visible data and sound, not the
objective field. Just as, though eye and ear are non-adherent
respectively to visible data and sounds still they have the word
'touched' used of them, so too it can be said of contact's touching and
impinging on the object. Contact's impinging is the actual concurrence
(meeting) of consciousness and object" (Vism-mhṭ 485).



62\. *Adhiṭṭhāna---*"habitat" (or site or location or foundation): this
meaning not given in PED.

manifested as coordinating. It accomplishes its own and others'
functions, as a senior pupil, a head carpenter, etc., do. But it is
evident when it occurs in the marshalling (driving) of associated states
in connection with urgent work, remembering, and so on. \[464\]



[136.] (iii)--(v) What should be said about *applied thought*, 
*sustained thought*, and *happiness* has already been said in the
commentary on the first jhāna in the Description of the Earth Kasiṇa
(IV.88--98).



[137.](vi) *Energy* (*viriya*) is the state of one who is
vigorous (*vīra*). Its characteristic is marshalling (driving). Its
function is to consolidate conascent states. It is manifested as
non-collapse. Because of the words: "Bestirred, he strives wisely" (A II
115), its proximate cause is a sense of urgency; or its proximate cause
is grounds for the initiation of energy. When rightly initiated, it
should be regarded as the root of all attainments.



[138.] (vii) By its means they live, or it itself lives, or it
is just mere living, thus it is life. But its characteristic, etc.,
should be understood in the way stated under material life (§59); for
that is life of material things and this is life of immaterial things.
This is the only difference here.



[139.] (viii) It puts (*ādhiyati*) consciousness evenly
(*samaṃ*) on the object, or it puts it rightly (*sammā*) on it, or it is
just the mere collecting (*samādhāna*) of the mind, thus it is
concentration (*samādhi*). Its characteristic is non-wandering, or its
characteristic is non-distraction. Its function is to conglomerate
conascent states as water does bath powder. It is manifested as peace.
Usually its proximate cause is bliss. It should be regarded as
steadiness of the mind, like the steadiness of a lamp's flame when there
is no draught.



[140.] (ix) By its means they have faith (*saddahanti*), or it
itself is the having of faith, or it is just the act of having faith
(*saddahana*), thus it is faith (*saddhā*). Its characteristic is having
faith, or its characteristic is trusting. Its function is to clarify,
like a water-clearing gem, or its function is to enter into, like the
setting out across a flood (cf. Sn 184). It is manifested as
non-fogginess, or it is manifested as resolution. Its proximate cause is
something to have faith in, or its proximate cause is the things
beginning with hearing the Good Dhamma (*saddhamma*) that constitute the
factors of stream-entry.63 It should be regarded as a hand \[because it
takes hold of profitable things\], as wealth (Sn 182), and as seed (Sn
77).



[141.](x) By its means they remember (*saranti*), or it itself
remembers, or it is just mere remembering (*saraṇa*), thus it is
*mindfulness* (*sati*). It has the characteristic of not wobbling.64 Its
function is not to forget. It is manifested as guarding, or it is
manifested as the state of confronting an objective field. Its proximate
cause is



63\. The four factors of stream-entry (see S V 347) are: waiting on good
men, hearing the Good Dhamma, wise attention, and practice in accordance
with the Dhamma. Again they are: absolute confidence in the Buddha, the
Dhamma, and the Sangha, and possession of noble virtue (S V 343).\



64\. "*Apilāpana (*'*not wobbling*'*) * is the steadying of an object,
the remembering and not forgetting it, keeping it as immovable as a
stone instead of letting it go bobbing about like a pumpkin in water"
(Vism-mhṭ 487).



[]



[]



strong perception, or its proximate cause is the foundations of
mindfulness concerned with the body, and so on (see MN 10). It should be
regarded, however, as like a pillar because it is firmly founded, or as
like a door-keeper because it guards the eye-door, and so on.



[142.] (xi)--(xii) It has conscientious scruples (*hiriyati*)
about bodily misconduct, etc., thus it is conscience (*hiri*). This is a
term for modesty. It is ashamed (*ottappati*) of those same things, thus
it is shame (*ottappa*). This is a term for anxiety about evil. Herein,
*conscience* has the characteristic of disgust at evil, while *shame*
has the characteristic of dread of it. *Conscience* has the function of
not doing evil and that in the mode of modesty, while *shame* has the
function of not doing it and that in the mode of dread. They are
manifested as shrinking from evil in the way already stated. Their
proximate causes are self-respect and respect of others
\[respectively\]. \[465\] A man rejects evil through *conscience* out of
respect for himself, as the daughter of a good family does; he rejects
evil through *shame* out of respect for another, as a courtesan does.
But these two states should be regarded as the guardians of the world
(see A I 51).



[143.] (xiii)--(xv) By its means they are not greedy (*na
lubbhanti*), or it itself is not greedy, or it is just the mere not
being greedy (*alubbhana*), thus it is *non-greed* (*alobha*). The same
method applies to *non-hate*  (*adosa*) and *non-delusion*  (*amoha*)
\[*na dussanti*, *adussana* = *adosa*, and *na muyhanti, amuyhana* =
*amoha* (see §§171,161)\].\
Of these, *non-greed* has the characteristic of the mind's lack of
desire for an object, or it has the characteristic of non-adherence,
like a water drop on a lotus leaf. Its function is not to lay hold, like
a liberated bhikkhu. It is manifested as a state of not treating as a
shelter, like that of a man who has fallen into filth. *Non- hate* has
the characteristic of lack of savagery, or the characteristic of non-
opposing, like a gentle friend. Its function is to remove annoyance, or
its function is to remove fever, as sandalwood does. It is manifested as
agreeableness, like the full moon. *Non-delusion* has the characteristic
of penetrating \[things\] according to their individual essences, or it
has the characteristic of sure penetration, like the penetration of an
arrow shot by a skilful archer. Its function is to illuminate the
objective field, like a lamp. It is manifested as non-bewilderment, like
a guide in a forest. The three should be regarded as the roots of all
that is profitable.



[144.] (xvi)--(xvii) The tranquillizing of the body is
*tranquillity of the body*. The tranquillizing of consciousness is
*tranquillity of consciousness*. And here body means the three
\[mental\] aggregates, feeling, \[perception and formations\] (see Dhs
40). But both tranquillity of that body and of consciousness have,
together, the characteristic of quieting disturbance of that body and of
consciousness. Their function is to crush disturbance of the \[mental\]
body and of consciousness. They are manifested as inactivity and
coolness of the \[mental\] body and of consciousness. Their proximate
cause is the \[mental\] body and consciousness. They should be regarded
as opposed to the defilements of agitation, etc., which cause
unpeacefulness in the \[mental\] body and in consciousness.



[145.] (xviii)--(xix) The light (quick) state of the \[mental\]
body is lightness of the body. The light (quick) state of consciousness
is lightness of consciousness. They have the characteristic of quieting
heaviness in the \[mental\] body and in



[]



[]



consciousness. Their function is to crush heaviness in the \[mental\]
body and in consciousness. They are manifested as non-sluggishness of
the \[mental\] body and of consciousness. Their proximate cause is the
\[mental\] body and consciousness. They should be regarded as opposed to
the defilements of stiffness and torpor, which cause heaviness in the
\[mental\] body and in consciousness.



[146.] (xx)--(xxi) The malleable state of the \[mental\] body
is *malleability of body*. The malleable state of consciousness is
*malleability of consciousness*. They have the characteristic of
quieting rigidity in the \[mental\] body and in consciousness. Their
function is to crush stiffening in the \[mental\] body and in
consciousness. They are manifested as non-resistance. Their proximate
cause is the \[mental body and consciousness. They should be regarded as
opposed to the defilements of views, conceit (pride), etc., which cause
stiffening of the \[mental body and of consciousness.



[147.] (xxii)--(xxiii) The wieldy state of the \[mental\] body
is *wieldiness of body*. The wieldy state of consciousness is
*wieldiness of consciousness*. They have the characteristic of quieting
unwieldiness in the \[mental\] body and in consciousness. \[466\] Their
function is to crush unwieldiness in the \[mental\] body and in
consciousness. They are manifested as success in making \[something\] an
object of the \[mental\] body and consciousness. Their proximate cause
is the \[mental\] body and consciousness. As bringing trust in things
that should be trusted in and as bringing susceptibility of application
to beneficial acts, like the refining of gold, they should be regarded
as opposed to the remaining hindrances, etc., that cause unwieldiness in
the \[mental\] body and in consciousness.



[148.] (xxiv)--(xxv) The proficient state of the \[mental\]
body is *proficiency of body*. The proficient state of consciousness is
*proficiency of consciousness*. They have the characteristic of
healthiness of the \[mental\] body and of consciousness. Their function
is to crush unhealthiness of the \[mental\] body and of consciousness.
They are manifested as absence of disability. Their proximate cause is
the \[mental\] body and consciousness. They should be regarded as
opposed to faithlessness, etc., which cause unhealthiness in the
\[mental\] body and in consciousness.



[149.] (xxvi)--(xxvii) The straight state of the \[mental\]
body is *rectitude of body*. The straight state of consciousness is
*rectitude of consciousness*. They have the characteristic of
uprightness of the \[mental\] body and of consciousness. Their function
is to crush tortuousness in the \[mental\] body and in consciousness.
They are manifested as non-crookedness. Their proximate cause is the
\[mental\] body and consciousness. They should be regarded as opposed to
deceit, fraud, etc., which cause tortuousness in the \[mental\] body and
in consciousness.65



65\. "And here by tranquilization, etc., of consciousness only
consciousness is tranquillized and becomes light, malleable, wieldy,
proficient and upright. But with tranquilization, etc., of the
\[mental\] body also the material body is tranquillized, and so on. This
is why the twofoldness of states is given by the Blessed One here, but
not in all places" (Vism-mhṭ 489).



[]



[]



[150.] (xxviii)  *Zeal*  (*desire*) is a term for desire to
act. So that zeal has the characteristic of desire to act. Its function
is scanning for an object. It is manifested as need for an object. That
same \[object\] is its proximate cause. It should be regarded as the
extending of the mental hand in the apprehending of an object.



[151.] (xxix) The act of resolving66 is  *resolution*. It has
the characteristic of conviction. Its function is not to grope. It is
manifested as decisiveness. Its proximate cause is a thing to be
convinced about. It should be regarded as like a boundary-post owing to
its immovableness with respect to the object.



[152.](xxx) It is the maker of what is to be made, it is the
maker in the mind (*manamhi kāro*), thus it is attention
(*bringing-to-mind---manasi-kāra*). It makes the mind different from the
previous \[life-continuum\] mind, thus it is attention. It has three
ways of doing this: as the controller of the object, as the controller
of the cognitive series, and as the controller of impulsions. Herein,
the controller of *the* *object* is the maker in the mind, thus it is
*attention*. That has the characteristic of conducting (*sāraṇa*). Its
function is to yoke associated states to the object. It is manifested as
confrontation with an object. Its proximate cause is an object. It
should be regarded as the conductor (*sārathi*) of associated states by
controlling the object, itself being included in the formations
aggregate. *Controller of the cognitive series* is a term for five-door
adverting (70). *Controller of impulsions* is a term for mind-door
adverting (71). These last two are not included here.



[153.] (xxxi)  *Specific neutrality* 
(*tatra-majjhattatā---*lit. "neutrality in regard thereto") is
neutrality (*majjhattatā*) in regard to those states \[of consciousness
and consciousness-concomitants arisen in association with it\]. It has
the characteristic of conveying consciousness and
consciousness-concomitants evenly. Its function is to prevent deficiency
and excess, \[467\] or its function is to inhibit partiality. It is
manifested as neutrality. It should be regarded as like a conductor
(driver) who looks with equanimity on thoroughbreds progressing evenly.



[154.] (xxxii)--(xxxiii)  *Compassion* and *gladness* should be
understood as given in the Description of the Divine Abodes (IX.§92, 94,
95), except that those are of the fine-material sphere and have attained
to absorption, while these are of the sense sphere. This is the only
difference. Some, however, want to include among the inconstant both
loving-kindness and equanimity. That cannot be accepted for, as to
meaning, non-hate itself is loving-kindness, and specific neutrality is
equanimity.



[155.] (xxxiv)--(xxxvi)  *Abstinence from bodily misconduct*:
the compound *kāyaduccaritavirati* resolves as *kāyaduccaritato virati*;
so also with the other two. But as regards characteristic, etc., these
three have the characteristic of non- transgression in the respective
fields of bodily conduct, etc.; they have the characteristic of not
treading there, is what is said. Their function is to draw back from the
fields of bodily misconduct, and so on. They are manifested as the not
doing of these things. Their proximate causes are the special qualities
of



66\. "'*The act of resolving'* should be understood as the act of being
convinced *(sanniṭṭhāna)* about an object, not as trusting *(pasādana)"*
(Vism-mhṭ 489). See §140.



[]



[]



faith, conscience, shame, fewness of wishes, and so on. They should be
regarded as the mind's averseness from evil-doing.



[156.] So these are the thirty-six formations that should be
understood to come into association with the first profitable
consciousness of the sense sphere (1). And as with the first, so with
the second (2), the only difference here being promptedness.



(3)--(4) Those associated with the third (3) should be understood as all
the foregoing except non-delusion (xv). Likewise with the fourth (4),
the only difference here being promptedness.



(5)--(6) All those stated in the first instance, except happiness (v),
come into association with the fifth (5). Likewise with the sixth (6),
the only difference here being promptedness.



(7)--(8) \[Those associated\] with the seventh (7) should be understood
as \[the last\] except non-delusion (xv). Likewise with the eighth (8),
the only difference here being promptedness.



[157.] (9)--(13) All those stated in the first instance, except
the three abstinences (xxxiv-xxxvi), come into association with the
first of the fine-material profitable \[kinds of consciousness\] (9).
With the second (10) applied thought (iii) is also lacking. With the
third (11) sustained thought (iv) is also lacking. With the fourth (12)
happiness (v) is also lacking. With the fifth (13) compassion (xxxii)
and gladness (xxxiii), among the inconstant, are also lacking.



(14)--(17) In the case of the four kinds of immaterial \[profitable
consciousness\] these are the same as the last-mentioned, for it is only
the immaterialness that is the difference here.



[158.] (18)--(21) As regards the supramundane, firstly, in the
case of the path consciousness having the first jhāna they should be
understood to be as stated in the case of the first fine-material-sphere
consciousness (9). The paths classed as belonging to the second jhāna,
etc., should be understood to be as stated in the cases \[respectively\]
of the second fine-material-sphere jhāna, and so on (10)-- (13). But the
difference here is absence of compassion (xxxii) and gladness
(xxxiii),67 constancy of the abstinences (xxxiv-xxxvi), and
supramundaneness. \[468\]



[159.] II. (22) As regards the *unprofitable*, there are
firstly seventeen associated with the first unprofitable consciousness
rooted in greed (22), that is to say, thirteen constant given in the
texts as such (see Dhs § 365) and four or-what- ever-states.



Herein, the thirteen given as such are these:



contact (i),\
volition (ii),\
applied thought (iii),



67\. "Because the path consciousnesses have Nibbāna as their object and
because compassion, gladness, etc., have living beings as their object,
there is no compassion, etc., in the path" (Vism-mhṭ 491).



[]



[]



sustained thought (iv),\
happiness (v),\
energy (vi),\
life (vii),\
concentration (viii),



[(xxxvii)]



consciencelessness,



[(xxxviii)]



shamelessness,



[(xxxix)]



greed,



[(xl)]



delusion,



[(xli)]



wrong view.



The four or-whatever-states are these:



zeal (xxviii),\
resolution (xxix),



[(xlii)]



agitation,\
attention (xxx).



[160.] Herein, (xxxvii) it has no conscientious scruples, thus
it is *consciencelessness*.



[(xxxviii)] It is unashamed, thus it is *shamelessness*. Of
these, *consciencelessness* has the characteristic of absence of disgust
at bodily misconduct, etc., or it has the characteristic of immodesty.
*Shamelessness* has the characteristic of absence of dread on their
account, or it has the characteristic of absence of anxiety about them.
This is in brief here. The detail, however, is the opposite of what was
said above under conscience (xi) and shame (xii).



[161.] (xxxix) By its means they are greedy, or it itself is
greedy, or it is just the mere being greedy, thus is it *greed*. (xl) By
its means they are deluded, or it itself is deluded, or it is just the
mere being deluded, thus it is *delusion*.



[162.]Of these, *greed* has the characteristic of grasping an
object, like birdlime (lit. "monkey lime"). Its function is sticking,
like meat put in a hot pan. It is manifested as not giving up, like the
dye of lamp-black. Its proximate cause is seeing enjoyment in things
that lead to bondage. Swelling with the current of craving, it should be
regarded as taking \[beings\] with it to states of loss, as a
swift-flowing river does to the great ocean.



[163.] *Delusion* has the characteristic of blindness, or it
has the characteristic of unknowing. Its function is non-penetration, or
its function is to conceal the individual essence of an object. It is
manifested as the absence of right theory (see Ch. XVII, §52), or it is
manifested as darkness. Its proximate cause is unwise (unjustified)
attention. It should be regarded as the root of all that is
unprofitable.



[164.] (xli) By its means they see wrongly, or it itself sees
wrongly, or it is just the mere seeing wrongly, thus it is *wrong view*.
Its characteristic \[469\] is unwise (unjustified) interpreting. Its
function is to presume. It is manifested as wrong interpreting. Its
proximate cause is unwillingness to see Noble Ones, and so on. It should
be regarded as the most reprehensible of all.



[165.] (xlii)  *Agitation* is agitatedness. It has the
characteristic of disquiet, like water whipped by the wind. Its function
is unsteadiness, like a flag or banner whipped by the wind. It is
manifested as turmoil, like ashes flung up by pelting



[]



[]



with stones. Its proximate cause is unwise attention to mental disquiet.
It should be regarded as distraction of consciousness.



[166.]The remaining formations here should be understood as
already stated under the profitable. For it is only the unprofitableness
that differentiates them as bad.



So these are the seventeen formations that should be understood to come
into



association with the first unprofitable consciousness (22). (23) And as
with the first, so with the second (23), but here the difference is
promptedness and inconstant \[occurrence\] of (xliii) stiffening and
torpor.



[167.] Herein, (xliii) stiffening (*thīnanatā*) is stiffness
(*thīna*); making torpid (*middhanatā*) is torpor (*middha*). The
meaning is, paralysis due to lack of urgency, and loss of vigour. The
compound *thīnamiddha*  (*stiffness*-*and*-*torpor*) should be resolved
into *thīnañ* *ca middhañ* *ca*. Herein, *stiffness* has the
characteristic of lack of driving power. Its function is to remove
energy. It is manifested as subsiding. *Torpor* has the characteristic
of unwieldiness. Its function is to smother. It is manifested as
laziness, or it is manifested as nodding and sleep.68 The proximate
cause of both is unwise attention to boredom, sloth, and so on.



[168.] (24) With the third \[unprofitable consciousness\] (24)
there should be understood to be associated those given for the first
(22), excepting wrong view (xli). But here the difference is that there
is inconstant \[occurrence\] of (xliv) pride (conceit).



That \[pride\] has the characteristic of haughtiness. Its function is
arrogance. It is manifested as vain gloriousness. Its proximate cause is
greed dissociated from views. It should be regarded as like madness.



\(25\) With the fourth (25) should be understood to be associated those
given for the second (23), excepting wrong view (xli). And here pride
(xliv) is among the inconstant too.



[169.] (26) Those given for the first (22), excepting happiness
(v), come into association with the fifth (26).



\(27\) And as with the fifth (26), so with the sixth too (27); but the
difference here is promptedness and the inconstant \[occurrence\] of
stiffness-and-torpor (xliii).



\(28\) With the seventh (28) should be understood to be associated those
given



for the fifth (26), except views (xli); but pride (xliv) is inconstant
here.



\(29\) With the eighth (29) should be understood to be associated those
given for the sixth (27), except views (xli); and here too pride (xliv)
is among the inconstant.



[170.] (30)--(31) As regards the two \[kinds of unprofitable
consciousness\] rooted in hate, \[470\] there are, firstly, eighteen
associated with the first (30), that is, eleven constant given in the
texts as such (see Dhs § 413), four or-whatever- states, and three
inconstant. Herein the eleven given as such are these:



68\. "Because the paralysis *(saṃhanana) * of consciousness comes about
through stiffness, but that of matter through torpor like that of the
three aggregates beginning with feeling, therefore torpor is manifested
as nodding and sleep" (Vism-mhṭ 493).



[]



[]



contact (i),\
volition (ii),\
applied thought (iii),\
sustained thought (iv),\
energy (vi),\
life (vii),\
concentration (viii),\
consciencelessness (xxxvii),\
shamelessness (xxxviii),



[(xiv)]



hate,\
delusion (xl).



The four or-whatever-states are these:



zeal (xxviii),\
resolution (xxix),\
agitation (xlii),\
attention (xxx).



The three inconstant are these:



[(xlvi)]



envy,



[(xlvii)]



avarice,



[(xlviii)]



worry.



[171.] Herein, (xlv) by its means they hate, or it itself
hates, or it is just mere hating, thus it is *hate* (*dosa*). It has the
characteristic of savageness, like a provoked snake. Its function is to
spread, like a drop of poison, or its function is to burn up its own
support, like a forest fire. It is manifested as persecuting (*dūsana*),
like an enemy who has got his chance. Its proximate cause is the grounds
for annoyance (see A V 150). It should be regarded as like stale urine
mixed with poison.



[172.] (xlvi) Envying is *envy*. It has the characteristic of
being jealous of other's success. Its function is to be dissatisfied
with that. It is manifested as averseness from that. Its proximate cause
is another's success. It should be regarded as a fetter.



[173.] (xlvii) Avariciousness is *avarice*. Its characteristic
is the hiding of one's own success that has been or can be obtained. Its
function is not to bear sharing these with others. It is manifested as
shrinking, or it is manifested as meanness. Its proximate cause is one's
own success. It should be regarded as a mental disfigurement.



[174.](xlviii) The vile (*kucchita*) that is done (*kata*) is
villainy (*kukata*).69 The state of that is *worry* (*kukkucca*). It has
subsequent regret as its characteristic. Its function is to sorrow about
what has and what has not been done. It is manifested as remorse. Its
proximate cause is what has and what has not been done. It should be
regarded as slavery.



69\. *Kukata* is not in PED. It is impossible to render into English
this "portmanteau" etymology, e.g. *kucchita-kata---kukata, kukutatā*
... *kukkucca,* which depends mostly on a fortuitous parallelism of
meaning and verbal forms in the Pali. While useless to strict modern
etymologists, it has a definite semantic and mnemonic use.



[]



[]



[175.] The rest are of the kind already described.



So these eighteen formations should be understood to come into
association



with the first \[unprofitable consciousness\] rooted in hate (30).



\(31\) And as with the first (30), so with the second (31), the only
difference, however, being promptedness and the presence of stiffness
and torpor (xliii) among the inconstant.



[176.] (32)--(33) As regards the two rooted in delusion,
firstly: \[associated\] with \[the consciousness that is\] associated
with uncertainty (32) \[471\] are the eleven given in the texts as such
thus:



contact (i),\
volition (ii),\
applied thought (iii),\
sustained thought (iv),\
energy (vi),\
life (vii),



[(xlix)]



steadiness of consciousness,\
consciencelessness (xxxvii),\
shamelessness (xxxviii),\
delusion (xl),



[(l)]



uncertainty.



The or-whatever-states are these two:



agitation (xlii),\
attention (xxx).



And these together total thirteen.



[177.] Herein, (xlix) *steadiness of consciousness* is weak
concentration (viii)



consisting in mere steadiness in occurrence.70



\(1\) It is without wish to cure (*vigatā cikicchā*), thus it is
*uncertainty* (*vicikicchā*). It has the characteristic of doubt. Its
function is to waver. It is manifested as indecisiveness, or it is
manifested as taking various sides. Its proximate cause is unwise
attention. It should be regarded as obstructive of theory (see XVII.52).



The rest are as already described.



[178.] (33) \[The consciousness\] associated with agitation
(33) has the same \[formations as the consciousness\] associated with
uncertainty (32), except for uncertainty (1). But with the absence of
uncertainty resolution (xxix) arises here. So with that they are
likewise thirteen, and concentration (viii) is stronger because of the
presence of resolution. Also agitation is given in the texts as such,
while resolution (xxix) and attention (xxx) are among the
or-whatever-states.



70\. "'*Mere steadiness in occurrence*'* * is mere presence for a
moment. That it is only "mere steadiness in occurrence" owing to the
mere condition for the steadiness of the mind *(ceto)* is because of
lack of real steadiness due to absence of decidedness *(nicchaya),* and
it is incapable of being a condition for such steadiness in continuity
(see §188) as the steadiness of consciousness stated thus: 'like the
steadiness of a flame sheltered from a draught' (XIV.139)" (Vism-mhṭ
495).



[]



[]



Thus should the unprofitable formations be understood.



[179.]III. As regards the *indeterminate*, firstly, the
*resultant indeterminate* (34)--(69) are twofold, classed as those
without root-cause and those with root-cause. Those associated with
resultant consciousness without root-cause (34)--(41), (50)--(56) are
those without root-cause.



Herein, firstly, those associated with the profitable resultant (34) and
unprofitable resultant (50) eye-consciousness are the four given in the
texts as such, namely:



contact (i),\
volition (ii),\
life (vii),\
steadiness of consciousness (xlix),



which amount to five with



attention (xxx)



as the only or-whatever-state.



These same kinds are associated with ear-, nose-, tongue-, and body-



consciousness (35)--(38), (51)--(54).



[180.] Those associated with both kinds of resultant
mind-element (39), (55) come to eight by adding applied thought (iii),
sustained thought (iv) and resolution (xxix). Likewise those associated
with the threefold mind- consciousness-element with root-cause (40),
(41), (56). But here (40) that accompanied by joy should be understood
to have happiness (v) also in addition to that.



[181.] The \[formations\] associated with resultant
consciousness with root-cause (42)--(49) are those with root-cause. Of
these, firstly, those associated with the sense-sphere resultant
\[consciousness\] with root-cause are similar to the formations
associated with the eight sense-sphere \[consciousnesses\] (1)--(8). But
of the inconstant ones, compassion (xxxii) and gladness (xxxiii) are not
among the resultant because they have living beings as their object. For
the resultant ones of the sense-sphere have only limited objects. And
not only compassion and gladness but also the three abstinences
(xxxiv)--(xxxvi) are not among the resultant; \[472\] for it is said
that "the five training precepts are profitable only" (Vibh 291).



[182.] (57)--(69) Those associated with the resultant
consciousness of the fine- material sphere (57)--(61), the immaterial
sphere (62)--(65), and the supramundane (66)--(69) are similar to the
formations associated with the profitable consciousnesses of those kinds
(9)--(21) too.



[183.] (70)--(89)  *Functional indeterminate* \[formations\]
are also twofold classed as those without root-cause (70)--(72) and
those with root-cause (73)--(80). Those without root-cause are
associated with functional consciousness without root- cause; and they
are the same as those associated \[respectively\] with profitable
resultant mind-element (39) and the pair of mind-consciousness-elements
without root-cause (40)--(41). But in the case of the two
mind-consciousness-



[]



[]



elements (71)--(72), energy (vi) is additional, and because of the
presence of energy, concentration (viii) is strong. This is the
difference here.



[184.] Those associated with functional consciousness with
root-cause (73)-- (80) are those with root-cause. Of these, firstly,
those associated with the eight sense-sphere functional consciousnesses
(73)--(80) are similar to the formations associated with the eight
sense-sphere profitable (1)--(8), except for the abstinences
(xxxiv)--(xxxvi).



Those associated with the functional \[consciousnesses\] of the
fine-material sphere (81)--(85) and the immaterial sphere (86)--(89) are
in all aspects similar to those associated with profitable consciousness
(9)--(17).



This is how formations should be understood as indeterminate.



This is the section of the detailed explanation dealing with the
formations



aggregate.



\[C. CLASSIFICATION OF THE AGGREGATES\]



[185.] The foregoing section, firstly, is that of the detailed
explanation of the aggregates according to the Abhidhamma-Bhājaniya \[of
the Vibhaṅga\]. But the aggregates have been given in detail by the
Blessed One \[in the Suttanta- Bhājaniya\] in this way: "Any materiality
whatever, whether past, future or present, internal or external, gross
or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near: all that together in the
mass and in the gross is called the materiality aggregate. Any feeling
whatever ... Any perception whatever ... Any formations whatever ... Any
consciousness whatever, whether past, future or present ... all that
together in the mass and in the gross is called the consciousness
aggregate" (Vibh 1--9; cf. M III 17).



\[MATERIALITY\]



[186.] Herein, the word *whatever* includes without exception.
*Materiality* prevents over-generalization. Thus materiality is
comprised without exception by the two expressions. Then he undertakes
its exposition as *past*,  *future* and *present*, etc.; for some of it
is classed as past and some as future, and so on. So also in the case of
feeling, and so on.



Herein, the materiality called (i) *past* is fourfold, according to (a)
extent, (b)



continuity, (c) period, and (d) moment. Likewise (ii) the *future* and
(iii) the *present*.71



71\. "Here when the time is delimited by death and rebirth-linking the
term 'extent' is applicable. It is made known through the Suttas in the
way beginning 'Was I in the past?' (M I 8); for the past state is
likewise mentioned as 'extent' in the Bhaddekaratta Sutta too in the way
beginning, 'He does not follow what is past (the past extent)' (M III 1
88). But when it is delimited in the ultimate sense as in the
Addhāniruttipatha Sutta thus, 'Bhikkhus, there are three extents, the
past extent, the future extent, and the present extent' (It 53), then it
is appropriate as delimited by moment. Herein, the existingness of the
present is stated thus, 'Bhikkhus, of matter that is born ...
manifested, it is said that: "It exists"' (S IV 72), and pastness and
futureness are respectively called before and after that" (Vism-mhṭ
496).



[]



[]



[187.] Herein, (a) firstly, *according to extent*: in the case
of a single becoming of one \[living being\], previous to
rebirth-linking is *past*, subsequent to death is *future*, between
these two is *present*.



[188.] (b)  *According to continuity*: that \[materiality\]
which has like or single origination72 by temperature and single
origination by nutriment, though it occurs successively, \[473\] is
*present*. That which, previous to that, was of unlike origination by
temperature and nutriment is *past*. That which is subsequent is
*future*. That which is born of consciousness and has its origination in
one cognitive series, in one impulsion, in one attainment, is *present*.
Previous to that is  *past*. Subsequent to that is *future*. There is no
special classification into past continuity, etc., of that which has its
origination in kamma, but its pastness, etc., should be understood
according as it supports those which have their origination through
temperature, nutriment, and consciousness.



[189.] (c)  *According to period*: any period among those such
as one minute, morning, evening, day-and-night, etc., that occurs as a
continuity, is called *present*. Previous to that is *past*. Subsequent
is *future*.



[190.](d) *According to moment*: what is included in the trio
of moments, \[that is to say, arising, presence, and dissolution\]
beginning with arising is called *present*. At a time previous to that
it is *future*. At a time subsequent to that it is *past*.73



[191.] Furthermore, that whose functions of cause and
condition74 have elapsed



is *past*. That whose function of cause is finished and whose function
of condition



72\. "Cold temperature is like with cold, and hot with hot. But that
temperature which falls on the body, whether hot or cold, and occurs as
a continuity in one mode, being neither less nor more, is called 'single
temperature.' The word 'single' is used because of the plurality of
'like' temperature. So too with nutriment. *'In one cognitive series, in
one impulsion'* refers respectively to five-door and mind-door
consciousness. The explanations of *continuity* and *period* are given
in the Commentaries for the purpose of helping the practice of insight"
(Vism-mhṭ 496).\



73\. In these two paragraphs "*past*"* * and "*future*"* * refer not to
time, as in the other paragraphs, but to the materiality.\



74\. "'*Cause*' *(hetu)* is what gives birth *(janaka);* '*condition*'
*(paccaya)* is what consolidates *(upatthambhaka).* Their respective
functions are arousing and consolidating. Just as the seed's function is
to arouse the sprout and that of the earth, etc., is to consolidate it,
and just as kamma's function is to arouse result as matter that is due
to kamma performed, and that of nutriment is to consolidate it, so the
function of those \[conditions\] that give birth to each material group
and each thought-arising and serve as kamma and proximity-conditions,
etc., for them, and the function of those that consolidate them and
serve as conascence, prenascence, and postnascence conditions for them
may be construed accordingly as appropriate.\
"Because there is similarity and dissimilarity in temperature, etc., in
the way stated, the pastness, etc., of material instances originated by
it are stated according to continuity. But there is no such similarity
and dissimilarity in the kamma that gives birth to a single becoming, so
instead of stating according to continuity the pastness, etc., of
material instances originated by that, it is stated according to what
consolidates. However, when there comes to be reversal of sex, then the
male sex disappears owing

is unfinished is *present*. That which has not attained to either
function is *future*. Or alternatively, the moment of the function is
*present*. At a time previous to that it is *future*. At a time
subsequent to that it is *past*.



And here only the explanations beginning with the *moment* are
absolutely



literal. The rest are in a figurative \[or relative\] sense.



[192.] (iv)--(v) The division into *internal and external* is
as already stated (§73). Besides, it is internal in the sense of one's
own75 that should be understood here as internal and that of another
person as external.



[(vi)]--(vii) *Gross and subtle* are also as already stated
(§73).



[193.] (viii)--(ix)  *Inferior and superior* are twofold,
namely, figuratively (relatively) and absolutely (literally). Herein,
the materiality of the Sudassin deities is inferior to the materiality
of the Akaniṭṭha (Highest) deities. That same materiality \[of the
Sudassin deities\] is superior to the materiality of the Sudassa
deities. Thus, firstly, should inferiority and superiority be understood
figuratively (relatively) down as far as the denizens of hell. But
absolutely (literally) it is inferior where it arises as unprofitable
result, and it is superior where it arises as profitable result.76



[194.] (x)--(xi) *Far and near*: this is also as already
described (§73). Besides, relative



farness and nearness should be understood here according to location.



[195.] *All that together in the mass and in the gross*: by
making all that materiality, separately described by the words "past,"
etc., into a collection by understanding its oneness, in other words,
its characteristic of being molested (*ruppana*), it comes to be called
the materiality (*rūpa*) aggregate. This is the meaning here.



[196.] By this, too, it is shown that the materiality aggregate
is all materiality, which all comes into the collection with the
characteristic of being molested; for there is no materiality aggregate
apart from materiality. \[474\]



And just as in the case of materiality, so also feeling, etc., \[are
respectively shown as the feeling aggregate, etc.,\] since they come
under the collections with the \[respective\] characteristics of being
felt, etc.; for there is no feeling aggregate apart from feeling and so
on.



to powerful unprofitable kamma, and the female sex appears owing to weak
profitable kamma; and the female sex disappears owing to weak
unprofitable kamma, while the male sex appears owing to powerful
profitable kamma (see Dhs-a 321). So there is in fact dissimilarity in
what is originated by kamma and consequent dissimilarity in what is
past, etc., in accordance with the continuity of these as well. But it
is not included because it does not happen always" (Vism-mhṭ 497).



75\. *Niyakajjhatta---*"internally in the sense of one's own": four
kinds of *ajjhatta* (internal, lit. "belonging to oneself") are
mentioned in the commentaries and sub-commentaries (see Dhs-a 46):
*gocarajjhatta---*internally* * as range or resort (M-a IV 161; II 90,
292), *ajjhattajjhata---*internally as such (Vism-mhṭ 152),
*niyakajjhatta---*internally in the sense of one's own (IV.141, IX.114,
this ref.; M-a IV 161), *visayajjhatta---*internally as objective field
(M-a IV 160).\



76\. Profitable result is superior because it produces a desirable
object (see Vism- mhṭ 498). This question is treated at length at Vibh-a
9f.

\[FEELING\]



[197.] In the classification (i)--(iii) into *past*, etc., the
past, future, and present state of feeling should be understood
according to continuity and according to moment and so on.



Herein,  *according to continuity*, that included in a single cognitive
series, a single impulsion, a single attainment, and that occurring in
association with an objective field of one kind,77 is *present*. Before
that is *past*. Subsequent is *future*.



*According to moment*, etc.: that feeling included in the trio of
moments, which is in between the past time and the future time, and
which is performing its own function, is *present*. Before that is
*past*. Subsequent is *future*.



[198.](iv)--(v)The classification into *internal* and
*external* should be understood according to the internal in the sense
of one's own.



[(vi)]--(vii) The classification into *gross * and  *subtle*
should be understood (a) according to kind, (b) individual essence, (c)
person, and (d) the mundane and supramundane, as stated in the Vibhaṅga
in the way beginning "Unprofitable feeling is gross, profitable and
indeterminate feeling is subtle, \[profitable and unprofitable feeling
is gross, indeterminate feeling is subtle\]" (Vibh 3), and so on.



[199.] (a)  *According to kind*, firstly: unprofitable feeling
is a state of disquiet, because it is the cause of reprehensible actions
and because it produces burning of defilement, so it is *gross*
\[compared\] with profitable feeling. And because it is accompanied by
interestedness and drive and result, and because of the burning of the
defilements, and because it is reprehensible, it is gross compared with
resultant indeterminate. Also because it is accompanied by result,
because of the burning of the defilements, and because it is attended by
affliction and is reprehensible, it is gross compared with functional
indeterminate. But in the opposite sense profitable and indeterminate
feeling are subtle compared with unprofitable feeling. Also the two,
that is, profitable and unprofitable feeling, involve interestedness,
drive and result, so they are respectively gross compared with the
twofold indeterminate. And in the opposite sense the twofold
indeterminate is subtle compared with them. This, firstly, is how
grossness and subtlety should be understood according to kind.



[200.](b)  *According to individual essence*: painful feeling
is gross compared with the others because it is without enjoyment, it
involves intervention, causes disturbance, creates anxiety, and is
overpowering. The other two are subtle compared with the painful because
they are satisfying, peaceful, and superior, and respectively agreeable
and neutral. Both the pleasant and the painful are gross compared with
the neither-painful-nor-pleasant because they involve intervention,
cause disturbance and are obvious. The latter is subtle in the way



77\. "The feeling that accompanies the faith, etc., occurring in one who
sees an image of the Buddha or who hears the Dhamma, even for a whole
day, is 'present'" (Vism- mhṭ 499).



[]



[]



aforesaid compared with both the former. Thus should grossness and
subtlety be understood according to individual essence.



[201.] (c)  *According to person*: feeling in one who has no
attainment is gross compared with that in one who has one, because it is
distracted by a multiple object. In the opposite sense the other is
subtle. This is how grossness and subtlety should be understood
according to person. \[475\]



[202.] (d)  *According to the mundane and supramundane*:
feeling subject to cankers is mundane, and that is gross compared with
that free from cankers, because it is the cause for the arising of
cankers, is liable to the floods, liable to the bonds, liable to the
ties, liable to the hindrances, liable to the clingings, defilable, and
shared by ordinary men. The latter, in the opposite sense, is subtle
compared with that subject to cankers. This is how grossness and
subtlety should be understood according to the mundane and supramundane.



[203.] Herein, one should beware of mixing up \[the
classifications\] according to kind and so on. For although feeling
associated with unprofitable resultant body-consciousness is subtle
according to kind because it is indeterminate, it is nevertheless gross
according to individual essence, and so on. And this is said:
"Indeterminate feeling is subtle, painful feeling is gross. The feeling
in one with an attainment is subtle, that in one with no attainment is
gross. Feeling free from cankers is subtle, feeling accompanied by
cankers is gross" (Vibh 3). And like painful feeling, so also pleasant,
etc., is gross according to kind and subtle according to individual
essence.



[204.] Therefore feeling's grossness and subtlety should be
understood in such a way that there is no mixing up of the
classifications according to kind and so on. For instance, \[when it is
said\] "The indeterminate according to kind is subtle compared with the
profitable and the unprofitable," the individual-essence class, etc.,
must not be insisted upon like this: "Which kind of indeterminate? Is it
the painful? Is it the pleasant? Is it that in one with an attainment?
Is it that in one with no attainment? Is it that subject to cankers? Is
it that free from cankers?" and so in each instance.



[205.] Furthermore, because of the words "Or feeling should be
regarded as gross or subtle in comparison with this or that feeling"
(Vibh 4), among the unprofitable, etc., feeling accompanied by hate,
too, is gross compared with that accompanied by greed because it burns
up its own support, like a fire; and that accompanied by greed is
subtle. Also, that accompanied by hate is gross when the hate is
constant, and subtle when it is inconstant. And the constant is gross
when giving result that lasts for the aeon, while the other is subtle.
And of those giving result lasting for the aeon the unprompted is gross,
while the other is subtle. But that accompanied by greed is gross when
associated with \[false\] view, while the other is subtle. That also
when constant and giving result lasting for the aeon and unprompted is
gross, while the others are subtle. And without distinction the
unprofitable with much result is gross, while that with little result is
subtle. But the profitable with little result is gross, while that with
much result is subtle.



[]



[]



[206.] Furthermore, the profitable of the sense sphere is
gross; that of the fine- material sphere is subtle; next to which the
immaterial, and next the supramundane \[should be similarly compared\].
That of the sense sphere is gross in giving, while it is subtle in
virtue; next, that in development. Also, that in development is gross
with two root-causes, while with three root-causes it is subtle. Also
that with three root-causes is gross when prompted, while it is subtle
when unprompted. That of the fine-material sphere is gross in the first
jhāna, \[while it is subtle in the second jhāna. That also of the second
jhāna is gross\] ... of the fifth jhāna is subtle. And that of the
immaterial sphere associated with the base consisting of boundless space
is gross ... \[476\] that associated with the base consisting of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception is subtle only. And the
supramundane associated with the stream-entry path is gross ... that
associated with the Arahant path is subtle only. The same method applies
also to resultant and functional feeling in the various planes and to
feeling stated according to pain, etc., according to one with no
attainment, etc., and according to that subject to cankers, and so on.



[207.] Then according to location, painful feelings in hell are
gross, while in the animal generation they are subtle ... Those among
the Paranimmitavasavatti Deities are subtle only. And the pleasant
should be construed throughout like the painful where suitable.



[208.] And according to physical basis, any feeling that has an
inferior physical



basis is gross, while one with a superior physical basis is subtle.



[(viii)]--(ix) What is gross should be regarded as *inferior*
in the inferior-superior



classification, and what is subtle *superior*.



[209.] \[(x)--(xi) The word *far* is explained in the Vibhaṅga
in the way beginning "The unprofitable is far from the profitable and
indeterminate" (Vibh 4) and the word  *near* in the way beginning
"Unprofitable feeling is near to unprofitable feeling" (Vibh 4).
Therefore, unprofitable feeling is far from the profitable and the
indeterminate because of dissimilarity, unconnectedness, and non-
resemblance. The profitable and the indeterminate are likewise far from
the unprofitable. And so in all instances. But unprofitable feeling is
near to unprofitable feeling because of similarity and resemblance.



This is the section of the detailed explanation dealing with the past,
etc.,



classifications of the feeling aggregate.



\[PERCEPTION, FORMATIONS AND CONSCIOUSNESS\]



[210.] This should also be understood of the perception, etc.,
associated with any kind of feeling.



\[D. CLASSES OF KNOWLEDGE OF THE AGGREGATES\]



Having understood this, again as regards these same aggregates:



Knowledge of aggregates is classed



\(1\)



As to order, and (2) distinction,



\(3\)



As to neither less nor more,



\(4\)



And likewise as to simile,



[]



[]



\(5\)



And twice as to how to be seen,



\(6\)



And as to good for one seeing thus---



This is the way of exposition



That a wise man should rightly know.



[211.] *1.* Herein, *as to order*: order is of several kinds,
namely, order of arising,



order of abandoning, order of practice, order of plane, order of
teaching.



Herein, "First there comes to be the foetus in the first stage, then
there comes to be the foetus in the second stage" (S I 206), etc., is
*order of arising*. "Things to be abandoned by seeing, things to be
abandoned by development" (Dhs 1), etc., is  *order of abandoning*.
"Purification of virtue \[477\] ... purification of consciousness" (M I
148), etc., is *order of practice*. "The sense sphere, the fine-
material sphere" (Paṭis I 83), etc., is *order of plane*. "The four
foundations of mindfulness, the four right efforts" (D II 120), etc., or
"Talk on giving, talk on virtue" (M I 379), etc., is *order of
teaching*.



[212.] Of these, firstly, *order of arising* is not applicable
here because the aggregates do not arise in the order in which they are
successively dealt with, as is the case with "the foetus in the first
stage," etc., nor is *order of abandoning* applicable, because the
profitable and indeterminate are not to be abandoned; nor is *order of
practice*, because what is unprofitable is not to be practiced; nor is
*order of plane*, because feeling, etc., are included in all four
planes.



[213.] *Order of teaching* is appropriate however; for there
are those people who, while teachable, have fallen into assuming a self
among the five aggregates owing to failure to analyze them; and the
Blessed One is desirous of releasing them from the assumption by getting
them to see how the \[seeming\] compactness of mass \[in the five
aggregates\] is resolved; and being desirous of their welfare, he first,
for the purpose of their easy apprehension, taught the materiality
aggregate, which is gross, being the objective field of the eye, etc.;
and after that, feeling, which feels matter as desirable and
undesirable; then perception, which apprehends the aspects of feeling's
objective field, since "What one feels, that one perceives" (M I 293);
then formations, which form volitionally through the means of
perception; and lastly, consciousness, which these things beginning with
feeling have as their support, and which dominates them.78



This, in the first place, is how the exposition should be known as to
order.



[214.] *As to distinction*: as to the distinction
between aggregates and aggregates- as-objects-of-clinging. But what is
the distinction between them? Firstly, *aggregates* is said without
distinguishing. *Aggregates \[as objects\] of clinging* is said
distinguishing those that are subject to cankers and are liable to the
clingings, according as it is said: "Bhikkhus, I shall teach you the
five aggregates and the five aggregates \[as objects\] of clinging.
Listen ... And what, bhikkhus, are the five aggregates? Any kind of
materiality whatever, bhikkhus, whether past, future or present ... far
or



78\. "Consciousness dominates because of the words, 'Dhammas have mind
as their forerunner' (Dhp l), 'Dhammas (states) that have parallel
turn-over with consciousness' (Dhs §1522), and 'The king, lord of the
six doors (?)'" (Vism-mhṭ 503).



[]



[]



near: this is called the materiality aggregate. Any kind of feeling
whatever ... Any kind of perception whatever ... Any kind of formations
whatever ... Any kind of consciousness whatever ... far or near: this is
called the consciousness aggregate. These, bhikkhus, are called the five
aggregates. And what, bhikkhus, are the five aggregates \[as objects\]
of clinging? Any kind of materiality whatever ... far or near, that is
subject to cankers and liable to the clingings: this is called the
materiality aggregate \[as object\] of clinging. Any kind of feeling
whatever ... Any kind of perception whatever ... Any kind of formations
whatever ... Any kind of consciousness whatever ... far or near, that is
subject to cankers and liable to the clingings: this is called the
consciousness aggregate \[as object\] of clinging. These, bhikkhus, are
called the five aggregates \[as objects\] of clinging" (S III 47).
\[478\]



[215.] Now, while there is feeling, etc., both free from
cankers \[and subject to them\],79 not so materiality. However, since
materiality can be described as a \[simple\] aggregate in the sense of a
total, it is therefore mentioned among the \[simple\] aggregates. And
since it can be described as an aggregate \[that is the object\] of
clinging in the sense of a total and in the sense of being subjected to
cankers, that \[same materiality\] is therefore mentioned among the
aggregates \[as objects\] of clinging too. But feeling, etc., are only
mentioned among the \[simple\] aggregates when they are free from
cankers. When they are subject to cankers, they are mentioned among the
aggregates \[as objects\] of clinging. And here the meaning of the term
"aggregates as objects of clinging" should be regarded as this:
aggregates that are the resort of clinging are aggregates of clinging.
But here all these taken together are intended as aggregates.



[216.] *3.* *As to neither less nor more*: but why are five
aggregates, neither less nor more, mentioned by the Blessed One? (a)
Because all formed things that resemble each other fall into these
groups, (b) because that is the widest limit as the basis for the
assumption of self and what pertains to self, and (c) because of the
inclusion80 by them of the other sorts of aggregates.



[217.] (a) When the numerous categories of formed states are
grouped together



according to similarity,81 materiality forms one aggregate through being
grouped



79\. *Sammohavinodanī* (Be) (Khandha Vibhaṅga Commentary) in the
identical passage, reads *vedanādayo anāsavā pi sāsavā pi atthi.* Ee and
Ae read *vedanādayo anāsavā pi atthi.* 80. *Avarodha---*"inclusion": not
in PED. The term *etaparama---*"the widest limit" is not mentioned in
PED. See M I 80, 339; S V 119; M-a III, 281. Cf. also *etāvaparama,* M I
246.



81\. "When all formed dhammas are grouped together according to
similarity, they naturally fall into five aggregates. Herein, it is the
items that are the same owing to the sameness consisting respectively in
'molesting,' etc., that are to be understood as 'similar.' Among them,
those that are strong in the volition whose nature is accumulating with
the function of forming the formed, are called the formations aggregate.
And the others, that is, contact, etc., which are devoid of the
distinguishing characteristics of 'being molested,' etc., may also be so
regarded under the generality of forming the formed. But the
similarities consisting in touching are not describable separately by
the word 'aggregate,' and so that is why no aggregates of contact, etc.,
have been stated by the Perfect One who knows the similarities of
dhammas. 'Bhikkhus, whatever ascetics or brahmans there are who are
asserters of eternity and declare the self and



[]



[]



together according to similarity consisting in materiality; feeling
forms one aggregate through being grouped together according to
similarity consisting in feeling; and so with perception and the other
two. So they are stated as five because similar formed things fall into
groups.



[218.] (b) And this is the extreme limit as the basis for the
assumption of self and what pertains to self, that is to say, the five
beginning with materiality. For this is said: "Bhikkhus, when matter
exists, it is through clinging to matter, through insisting upon
(interpreting) matter, that such a view as this arises: 'This is mine,
this is I, this is my self.' When feeling exists ... When perception
exists ... When formations exist ... When consciousness exists, it is
through clinging to consciousness, through insisting upon (interpreting)
consciousness, that such a view as this arises: 'This is mine, this is
I, this is my self'"(S III 181--82). So they are stated as five because
this is the widest limit as a basis for the assumption of self and what
pertains to self.



[219.] (c) And also, since those other \[sorts of aggregates\]
stated as the five aggregates of things beginning with virtue82 are
comprised within the formations aggregate, they are included here too.
Therefore they are stated as five because they include the other sorts.



This is how the exposition should be known as to neither less nor more.



[220.] *4.*  *As to simile*: the materiality aggregate \[as
object\] of clinging is like a sick-room because it is the
dwelling-place, as physical basis, door, and object, of the sick man,
namely, the consciousness aggregate as object of clinging. The feeling
aggregate as object of clinging is like the sickness because it
afflicts. The perception aggregate as object of clinging is like the
provocation of the sickness because it gives rise to feeling associated
with greed, etc., owing to perception of sense desires, and so on. The
formations aggregate as object of clinging is like having recourse to
what is unsuitable because it is the source of feeling, which is the
sickness; \[479\] for it is said: "Feeling as feeling is the formed that
they form" (S III 87), and likewise: "Because of unprofitable kamma
having been performed and stored up, resultant body-consciousness has
arisen accompanied by pain" (Dhs §556). The consciousness aggregate as
object of clinging is like the sick man because it is never free from
feeling, which is the sickness.



[221.] Also they are (respectively) like the prison, the
punishment, the offence, the punisher, and the offender. And they are
like the dish, the food, the curry sauce \[poured over the food\], the
server, and the eater.83



the world to be eternal, all do so depending and relying on these same
five aggregates or on one or other of them' (cf. S IV 46), and so on"
(Vism-mhṭ 503).



82\. The aggregates of virtue, concentration, understanding, liberation,
and knowledge and vision of liberation (S I 99), etc.\



83\. "The matter of the body is like the *prison* because it is the site
of the punishment. *Perception is like the offence* because owing to
perception of beauty, etc., it is a cause of the *punishment,* which is
*feeling.* The *formations aggregate* is like the *punisher* because it
is a cause of feeling. *Consciousness* is like the *offender* because it
is afflicted by feeling. Again, *matter* is like the *dish* because it
bears the food. *Perception* is like the *curry sauce*

This is how the exposition should be known as to simile.



[222.] *5.*  *Twice as to how to be seen*: the exposition
should be known twice as to



how to be seen, namely, in brief and in detail.



[223.] In brief \[that is, collectively\] the five aggregates
as objects of clinging should be seen as an enemy with drawn sword (S IV
174) in the Snake Simile, as a burden (S III 25) according to the Burden
Sutta, as a devourer (S III 87f) according to the To-be-devoured
Discourse, and as impermanent, painful, not- self, formed, and
murderous, according to the Yamaka Sutta (S III 112f).



[224.] In detail \[that is, individually,\] matter should be
regarded as a lump of froth because it will not stand squeezing, feeling
as a bubble on water because it can only be enjoyed for an instant,
perception as a mirage because it causes illusion, formations as a
plantain trunk because they have no core, and consciousness as a
conjuring trick because it deceives (S III 140--42).



In particular, even sublime internal materiality84 should be regarded as
foul (ugly); feeling should be regarded as painful because it is never
free from the three kinds of suffering (see XVI.34); perception and
formations as not-self because they are unmanageable; and consciousness
as impermanent because it has the nature of rise and fall.



[225.] *6.* *As to good for one seeing thus*: good comes to be
accomplished in one who sees in the two ways thus in brief and in
detail. And the way of definition should be known according to that,
that is to say, firstly, one who sees the five aggregates as objects of
clinging in the form of an enemy with drawn sword, etc., is not worried
by the aggregates, but one who sees materiality, etc., in detail as a
lump of froth, etc., is not one who sees a core in the coreless.



[226.] And in particular, \[480\] one who sees internal
materiality as foul (ugly) fully understands nutriment consisting of
physical nutriment. He abandons the perversion \[of perceiving\] beauty
in the foul (ugly), he crosses the flood of sense desire, he is loosed
from the bond of sense desire, he becomes canker-free as regards the
canker of sense desire, he breaks the bodily tie of covetousness. He
does not cling with sense-desire clinging.



[227.]One who sees feeling as pain fully understands nutriment
consisting of contact. He abandons the perversion of perceiving pleasure
in the painful. He crosses the flood of becoming. He is loosed from the
bond of becoming. He becomes canker-free as regards the canker of
becoming. He breaks the bodily tie of ill will. He does not cling with
rules-and-vows clinging.



[228.] One who sees perception and formations as not-self fully
understands



nutriment consisting of mental volition. He abandons the perversion of



because, owing to perception of beauty, etc., it hides the *food, *
which is *feeling. * The *formations aggregate* is like the *server *
because it is a cause of *feeling; * and service is included since one
who is taking a meal is usually served. *Consciousness * is like the
*eater* because it is helped by feeling" (Vism-mhṭ 504). For *cāraka*
(prison) see XVI.18.

perceiving self in the not-self. He crosses the flood of views. He is
loosed from the bond of views. He breaks the bodily tie of
interpretations (insistence) that "This is the truth." He does not cling
with self-theory clinging.



[229.] One who sees consciousness as impermanent fully
understands nutriment consisting of consciousness. He abandons the
perversion of perceiving permanence in the impermanent. He crosses the
flood of ignorance. He is loosed from the bond of ignorance. He becomes
canker-free as regards the canker of ignorance. He breaks the bodily tie
of holding to rules and vows. He does not \[cling with false-\] view
clinging.

## CHAPTER XV 


THE BASES AND ELEMENTS



(*Āyatana-dhātu-niddesa*)



\[A. DESCRIPTION OF THE BASES\]



[1.]\[481\] The "bases" (XIV.32) are the twelve bases, that is
to say, the eye base, visible-data base, ear base, sound base, nose
base, odour base, tongue base, flavour base, body base, tangible-data
base, mind base, mental-data base.



[2.] Herein:



\(1\) Meaning, (2) character, (3) just so much,\
(4) Order, and (5) in brief and detail,\
(6) Likewise as to how to be seen---\
Thus should be known the exposition.



[3.]Herein, \[*as to meaning*\] firstly
individually:



It relishes (*cakkhati*), thus it is an eye (*cakkhu*); the meaning is
that it enjoys a



visible datum and turns it to account.



It makes visible (*rūpayati*), thus it is a visible datum (*rūpa*); the
meaning is that by undergoing an alteration in appearance (colour) it
evidences what state is in the mind (lit. heart).



It hears (*suṇāti*), thus it is an ear (*sota*).



It is emitted (*sappati*), thus it is sound (*sadda*); the meaning is
that it is uttered.



It smells (*ghāyati*), thus it is a nose (*ghāna*).



It is smelt (*gandhayati*) thus it is odour (*gandha*); the meaning is
that it betrays



its own physical basis.



It evokes (*avhayati*) life (*jīvita*), thus it is a tongue (*jivhā*).



Living beings taste (*rasanti*) it, thus it is flavour (*rasa*); the
meaning is that they



enjoy it.



It is the origin (*āya*) of vile (*kucchita*) states subject to cankers,
thus it is a body



(*kāya*), origin being the place of arising.



It is touched (*phusiyati*), thus it is a tangible datum (*phoṭṭhabba*).



It measures (*munāti*), thus it is a mind (*mano*).



They cause their own characteristic to be borne (*dhārayanti*), thus
they are



mental data (*dhammā*).1


[]



[]



[4.]\[As to meaning\] in general, however, base (*āyatana*)
should be understood as such (a) because of its actuating (*āyatana*),
(b) because of being the range (*tanana*) of the origins (*āya*), and
(c) because of leading on (*nayana*) what is actuated (*āyata*).2



Now, the various states of consciousness and its concomitants belonging
to such and such a door-cum-object among those consisting of the
eye-cum-visible- datum, etc., (a) are actuated (*āyatanti*), each by
means of its individual function of experiencing, etc.; they are active,
strive, and endeavour in these, is what is meant. And (b) these
\[doors-cum-objects\] provide the range for (*tananti*) those states
that are origins (*āya*); they give them scope, is what is meant. And
(c) as long as this suffering of the round of rebirths, which has gone
on occurring throughout the beginningless round of rebirths and so is
enormously actuated (*āyata*), does not recede, so long they lead on
(*nayanti*); they cause occurrence, is what is meant.



So all these \[482\] things are called "bases" because they actuate,
because they



are the range of the origins, and because they lead on what is actuated.



1\. The following words in §3 are not in PED: *cakkhati* (it relishes),
*rūpayati* (it makes visible---only referred to under *rūpa*), 
*sappati* (it is emitted; pass. of *sapati*, to swear (Ud 45)),
*udāhariyati* (it is uttered, lit. "is carried up to"), *gandhayati* (it
is smelt), *sūcayati* (it betrays), *rasati* (it tastes). Be ed. of
Vibh-a reads *manayati* (not in PED) for *muṇāti* in parallel passage.\
Vism-mhṭ (p. 508) explains *cakkhati* (relishes) semantically by
"tasting a flavour as in 'relishing' honey or sauce" and cites M I 503.
Linguistically it connects the word with *ācikkhati* (to show).\
"When a visible form (*rūpa*) undergoes, like the visible aspect of a
chameleon, an alteration in appearance (colour) at times when \[the mind
is\] dyed with greed or corrupted with hate, etc., it makes visible what
state \[is prevalent\] in the heart (i.e. the mind) and makes that
evident as though it were an actual visible object; the meaning is that
it demonstrates it by giving it, as it were, a graspable entity
(*saviggaha*). Or the word rūpa means demonstration, and that is the
same as evidencing. Or the word *rūpa* can be regarded as evidencing of
elements too, since it has many meanings. *Rūpayati* (it makes visible)
is a derivative (*nibbacana*) of the word *rūpa* that expresses
appearance (colour), while *ruppati* (it is molested) is a derivative
that expresses the materiality aggregate. \[As to sound\] only the sound
of words (*vacana-sadda*) would be covered by the meaning '*is uttered*
(*udāhariyati*),' and here sound is not only the sound of words, but
rather all that can be cognized by the ear is what '*is emitted*
(*sappati*)'; the meaning is that by means of its own conditions it is
emitted (*sappiyati*), is made cognizable by the ear" (Vism-mhṭ 508)
(cf. also *sappari*, to crawl). "'It *evokes life* (*jīvitaṃ avhayati*)'
owing to appetite for tastes in food (*āhāra*), which is the cause of
life (*jīvita*), since the act of swallowing is rooted in approval of
tastes. This is the linguistic characteristic of the word *jivhā*
(tongue)" (Vism-mhṭ 509).



2\. The following words in §4 are not in PED: *āyatana* (actuating:
verbal n. fm. *āyatati*, to actuate); *tanana* (range: verbal n. fm.
*tanoti*, to provide a range for, to extend---q.v. PED---; mentioned
under *āyatana*, base); *nayana* (lead in on: verbal n. fm. *neti*, to
lead on; lit, meaning not in PED); *āyatati* (to
actuate---*cakkhuviññāṇādīnaṃ uppādanaṃ āyatanaṃ*, Vism-mhṭ). See also
*āyāpenti* Paṭis II 21.



[]



[]



[5.]Furthermore, "base, (*āyatana*) should be understood in the
sense of place of abode, store (mine),3 meeting place, locality of
birth, and cause. For accordingly in the world in such phrases as the
lord's sphere" (*āyatana*) and "Vāsudeva's sphere" (*āyatana*), it is a
place of abode that is called "base"; and in such phrases as "the sphere
of gold" and "the sphere of silver" it is a store (mine) that is called
"base." But in the Dispensation, in such passages as:



"And so in the delightful realm (*āyatana*)\
Those flying in the air attend him" (A III 43),



it is a meeting place; and in such phrases as "The southern land is the
realm (*āyatana*) of cattle" (?) it is the locality of birth; and in
such passages as "He acquires the ability to be a witness of it ...
whenever there is an occasion (*āyatana*) for it'" (M I 494; A I 258),
it is a cause.



[6.]And these various states of consciousness and its
concomitants dwell in the eye, etc., because they exist in dependence on
them, so the eye, etc., are their *place of abode*. And they frequent
the eye, etc., because they have them \[respectively\] as their
\[material\] support and as their object, so the eye, etc., are their
*store*. And the eye, etc., are their *meeting place* because they meet
together in one or other of them, \[using them\] as physical basis,
door, and object. And the eye, etc., are the *locality of their birth*
because they arise just there, having them as their respective supports
and objects. And the eye, etc., are their *reason* because they are
absent when the eye, etc., are absent.



[7.]So for these reasons too these things are called "bases" in
the sense of place of abode, store, meeting place, locality of birth,
and reason.



Consequently, in the sense already stated, it is an eye and that is a
base, thus it is the eye base ... They are mental data and those are a
base, thus they are the mental-data base.



This is how the exposition should be known here as to meaning.



[8.] *Character*: Here too the exposition should
be known as to the characteristic of the eye and so on. But their
characteristics should be understood in the way given above in the
Description of the Aggregates (XIV.37ff.).



[9.] *As to just so much*: as just so many.4 What
is meant is this: The eye, etc., are mental data too; that being so, why
is "twelve bases" said instead of simply "mental-data base?" It is for
the sake of defining door-cum-object for the arising of the six
consciousness groups. And here they are stated as twelve since this is
how they are classed when so defined. \[483\]



[10.]For only the eye base is the door of arising, and only the
visible-data base is the object, of the consciousness group comprised in
a cognitive series containing eye-consciousness. Likewise the others for
the others.



3\. *Ākara* means either a mine or a store (PED apparently believes in
mining for pearls---see  *ratanākara*).\



4\. "Because of the absence of anything whatever not included in the
twelve bases, there is no arguing that they are more than twelve"
(Vism-mhṭ 510).



[]



[]



But only one part of the mind base, in other words, the life-continuum
mind,5 is the door of arising, and only the mental-data base not common
to all is the object, of the sixth \[consciousness group\].



So they are called "the twelve" because they define door-cum-object for
the arising of the six consciousness groups. This is how the exposition
should be known here as to just so much.



[11.] *4. As to order*: here too, from among "order of
arising," etc., mentioned above (XIV.211), only "order of teaching" is
appropriate. For the eye is taught first among the internal bases since
it is obvious because it has as its objective field what is visible with
resistance (see last triad, Dhs 2). After that the ear base, etc., which
have as their objective fields what is invisible with resistance. Or
alternatively, the eye base and ear base are taught first among the
internal bases because of their great helpfulness as \[respective\]
causes for the "incomparable of seeing" and the "incomparable of
hearing" (see D III 250). Next, the three beginning with the nose base.
And the mind base is taught last because it has as its resort the
objective fields of the \[other\] five (M I 295). But among the external
bases the visible-data base, etc., \[are taught\] each one next \[to its
corresponding internal base\] because they are the respective resorts of
the eye base, and so on.



[12.]Furthermore, their order may be understood as that in
which the reasons for consciousness's arising are defined; and it is
said: "Due to eye and to visible objects eye-consciousness arises, ...
due to mind and mental objects mind- consciousness arises" (M I 111).



This is how the exposition should be known here as to order.



[13.] *5.*  *In brief and in detail*: in brief the twelve bases
are simply mentality- materiality because the mind base and one part of
the mental-data base are included in mentality, and the rest of the
bases in materiality.



[14.]But in detail, firstly as regards the internal bases, the
eye base is, as to kind, simply eye sensitivity; but when it is
classified according to condition, destiny, order \[of beings\], and
person,6 it is of infinite variety. Likewise the four beginning with the
ear base. And the mind base, when classified according to profitable,
unprofitable, resultant, and functional consciousness, is of eighty-nine
kinds or of one hundred and twenty-one kinds,7 but it is of infinite
variety when classified



5\. "'*In other words, the life-continuum mind*': that which occurs
twice in disturbance (see Ch. XIV, note 46). Only when there has been
the occurrence of the life-continuum in a state of disturbance (in a
state of dissimilar occurrence) is there the arising of adverting, not
otherwise. Taking it thus as the reason for adverting, what is called
'life-continuum mind' is a door of arising. '*Not common to all*' means
not common to eye-consciousness and the rest" (Vism-mhṭ 510). See M I
293.



6\. "'*Condition*' is kamma, etc., 'destiny' is from hell upwards;
'order \[*of beings*\]' refers to such species as elephants, horses,
etc., or to the castes of the khattiyas (warrior nobles), and so on;
'*person*' refers to any given living being's continuity" (Vism-mhṭ
511).



7\. There are eighty-one mundane sorts of consciousness; and since there
is no path or fruition without jhāna, when the four paths and four
fruitions are multiplied by the five jhānas, there are forty kinds of
supramundane consciousness: 81+40 = 121.



[]



[]



according to physical basis, progress, and so on.8 The visible-data,
sound, odour, and flavour bases are of infinite variety when classified
according to dissimilarity, condition, and so on.9 The tangible-data
base is of three kinds as consisting of earth element, fire element, and
air element; \[484\] but when classified according to condition, etc.,
it is of many kinds. The mental-data base is of many kinds when
classified according to the several individual essences of feeling,
perception, formations, subtle matter, and Nibbāna (see Vibh 72).



This is how the exposition should be known in brief and in detail.



[15.] *6.* *As to how to be seen*: here all formed bases should
be regarded as having no provenance and no destination. For they do not
come from anywhere prior to their rise, nor do they go anywhere after
their fall. On the contrary, before their rise they had no individual
essence, and after their fall their individual essences are completely
dissolved. And they occur without mastery \[being exercisable over
them\] since they exist in dependence on conditions and in between the
past and the future. Hence they should be regarded as having no
provenance and no destination.



Likewise they should be regarded as incurious and uninterested. For it
does not occur to the eye and the visible datum, etc., "Ah, that
consciousness might arise from our concurrence." And as door, physical
basis, and object, they have no curiosity about, or interest in,
arousing consciousness. On the contrary, it is the absolute rule that
eye-consciousness, etc., come into being with the union of eye with
visible datum, and so on. So they should be regarded as incurious and
uninterested.



[16.] Furthermore, the internal bases should be regarded as an
empty village because they are devoid of lastingness, pleasure, and
self; and the external ones as village-raiding robbers (S IV 175)
because they raid the internal ones. And this is said: "Bhikkhus, the
eye is harassed by agreeable and disagreeable visible objects" (S IV
175). Furthermore, the internal ones should be regarded as like the six
creatures (S IV 198--99) and the external ones as like their resorts.



This is how the exposition should be known here as to how to be seen.



This, firstly, is the section of the detailed explanation dealing with
the bases.



\[B. DESCRIPTION OF THE ELEMENTS\]



[17.]The "elements" next to that (XIV.32) are the eighteen
elements, that is to say, eye element, visible-data element,
eye-consciousness element; ear element, sound element, ear-consciousness
element; nose element, odour element, nose- consciousness element;
tongue element, flavour element, tongue-consciousness element; body
element, tangible-data element, body-consciousness element; mind
element, mental-data element, mind-consciousness element.



8\. "'*Physical basis*' is that consisting of the eye, etc.; according
to that '*Progress*' is a painful progress, and the other three. '*And
so on*' refers to jhāna, predominance, plane, object, and so on"
(Vism-mhṭ 512).\



9\. "Blue is similar to blue; it is dissimilar to any other colour.
'*Condition*' is kamma, and so on" (Vism-mhṭ 512).



[]



[]



[18.] Herein:



\(1\) As to meaning, (2) characteristic, et cetera,\
(3) Order, (4) just so much, and (5) reckoning,\
(6) Then condition, and (7) how to be seen---\
Thus should be known the exposition.



[19.] *1.* Herein, *as to meaning*: first the exposition of
"eye," etc., should be known individually as to meaning in the way
beginning: It relishes (*cakkhati*), thus it is an eye (*cakkhu*); it
makes visible (*rūpayati*), thus it is a visible datum; \[485\] and the
consciousness of the eye is eye-consciousness (see §3).



As to meaning in general: (a) it sorts out (*vidahati*), (b) it assorts
\[well\] (*dhīyate*),



[(c)] a sorting out (*vidhāna*), (d) it is sorted out
(*vidhīyate*) by means of that, or (e) it causes to be sorted
(*dhīyati*) here, thus it is a sort (*dhātu* = element).10



[20.] (a) The mundane sorts (elements), when defined according
to their instrumentality, *sort out* (*vidahanti*) the suffering of the
round of rebirths, which is of many kinds, just as the "sorts"
(ores---see XI.20) of gold and silver, etc., do gold and silver, and so
on. (b) They assort \[well\] (*dhīyante*) with living beings, as a
burden does with burden bearers; they are borne (*dhāriyanti*), is the
meaning. (c) And they are only mere sortings out (*vidhāna*) of
suffering because no mastery is exercisable over them. (d) And by means
of them as instruments the suffering of the round of rebirths is
continually being sorted out (*anuvidhīyati*) by living beings. (e) And
that \[suffering\], being sorted out (*vihita*) in this way, is caused
to be sorted (*dhīyati*) into those \[sorts (elements)\]; it is caused
to be placed in them, is the meaning. So each thing (*dhamma*) among
those beginning with the eye is called a "sort" (*dhātu---*element) in
the meaning just stated beginning "It sorts out, it assorts well."



[21.] Furthermore, while the self of the sectarians does not
exist with an individual essence, not so these. These, on the contrary,
are elements (*dhātu*) since they cause \[a state's\] own individual
essence to be borne (*dhārenti*).11 And just as in the world the
variously-coloured constituents of marble such as malachite, cinnabar,
etc., are called "elements," so too these \[beginning with the



10\. The verb *dahati*, the basis of all these derivatives, means
literally "to put." "There are five meanings stated, since the word
*dhātu* (element, sort, 'putting') has its form established (*siddha*)
here by (a) the transitive (*kattu*), (b) the intransitive (*kamma*),
(c) the abstract noun (*bhāva*), (d) the instrumental case (*kāraṇa*),
and (e) the causative voice (*adhikaraṇa*). Supramundane elements do not
sort out (*vidahanti*) the suffering of the round of rebirths; on the
contrary, they destroy (*vidhaṃsenti*) it. That is why '*mundane'* is
specified" (Vism-mhṭ 513).\



11\. "'*Are elements since they cause \[a state's\] own individual
essence to be borne*': here, while the establishment of the word's form
should be understood as "*dadhātī ti dhātu* (it puts, sorts, thus it is
an element),' still taking the word *dhā* to share the meanings \[of
both  *dadhāti* and *dhāreti* (see XI.104)\], there is also the meaning
of the active voice different from the first, because the meanings of
*vidhāna* (sorting out) and *dhāraṇa* (causing to bear) are unconnected.
The causing of the bearing of mere individual essences without any
permanent living being, is a basic meaning of the word *dhātu*
(element), and so it is stated separately" (Vism-mhṭ 513).

eye\] are elements like those;12 for they are the "variously-coloured"
constituents of knowledge and the knowable. Or just as the general term
"elements" is used for juices, blood, etc., which are constituents of
the collection called the "carcass," when they are distinguished from
each other by dissimilarity of characteristic, so too the general term
"elements" should be understood as used for the constituents of the
selfhood (personality) called "the pentad of aggregates"; for these
things beginning with the eye are distinguished from each other by
dissimilarity of characteristic.



[22.]Furthermore, "element" is a term for what is soulless; and
for the purpose of abolishing the perception of soul the Blessed One
accordingly taught the elements in such passages as "Bhikkhu, this man
has six elements" (M III 239). Therefore the exposition should be
understood here firstly as to meaning thus: it is an eye and that is an
element, thus it is the eye-element *...* It is mind- consciousness and
that is an element, thus it is mind-consciousness element.



[23.] *2.* *As to characteristic, et cetera*: here too the
exposition should be understood as to the characteristic, etc., of the
eye, and so on. And that should be understood in the way given above in
the Description of the Aggregates (XIV.37ff.).



[24.] *3.*  *As to order*: here too, from among "order of
arising," etc., mentioned above (XIV.211), only "order of teaching" is
appropriate. It is set forth according to successive definition of cause
and fruit.13 For the pair, eye element and visible- data element, are
the cause and eye-consciousness element is the fruit. So in each case.



[25.] *4.* *As to just so much*: as just so many. What is meant
is this: in various places in the Suttas and Abhidhamma the following as
well as other \[486\] elements are met with---the illumination element,
beauty element, base-consisting-of- boundless-space element,
base-consisting-of-boundless-consciousness element,
base-consisting-of-nothingness element,
base-consisting-of-neither-perception- nor-non-perception element,
cessation-of-perception-and-feeling element (S II 150); sense-desire
element, ill-will element, cruelty element, renunciation element,
non-ill-will element, non-cruelty element (Vibh 86); bodily-pleasure
element, bodily-pain element, joy element, grief element, equanimity
element, ignorance element (Vibh 85); initiative element, launching
element, persistence element (S V 66); inferior element, medium element,
superior element (D III 215); earth element, water element, fire
element, air element, space element, consciousness element (Vibh 82);
formed element, unformed element (M III 63); the world of many elements,
of various elements (M I 70)---that being so, why is the classification
only made according to these eighteen instead of making it



12\. "'*Are elements like those elements*': here, just as the word
"lion" (*sīha*), which is properly applicable to the bearer of a mane,
\[is used\] of a man, so too the word 'element,' which is properly
applicable to the constituents of marble, is used of the eye and so on"
(Vism-mhṭ 513).\



13\. "'*Successive definition of cause and fruit*' is just the state of
cause and fruit" (Vism- mhṭ 514).



[]



[]



according to all of them? Because, as far as individual essence is
concerned, all existing elements are included in that
\[classification\].



[26.] The visible data-element itself is the illumination
element. The beauty element is bound up with visible-data and so on.
Why? Because it is the sign of the beautiful. The sign of the beautiful
is the beauty element and that does not exist apart from visible data
and so on. Or since the visible data, etc., that are objects consisting
of profitable kamma-result are themselves the beauty element, that is
thus merely visible data and so on. As regards the base-consisting-of-
boundless-space element, etc., the consciousness is mind-consciousness
element only, while the remaining \[states\] are the mental-data
element. But the cessation- of-perception-and-feeling element does not
exist as an individual essence; for that is merely the cessation of two
elements.14



[27.]The sense-desire element is either merely the mental-data
element, according as it is said, "Herein, what is the sense-desire
element? It is the thought, applied thought, *...* wrong thinking, that
is associated with sense desires" (Vibh 86), or it is the eighteen
elements, according as it is said: "Making the Avīci hell the lower
limit and making the Paranimmitavasavatti deities the upper limit, the
aggregates, elements, bases, materiality, feeling, perception,
formations, and consciousness that are in this interval, that belong
here, are included here: these are called the sense desire element"
(Vibh 86). \[487\]



[28.]The renunciation element is the mental-data element; also,
because of the passage, "Also all profitable states are the renunciation
element" (Vibh 86), it is the mind-consciousness element too. The
elements of ill-will, cruelty, non-ill- will, non-cruelty, bodily
pleasure, bodily pain, joy, grief, equanimity, ignorance, initiative,
launching, and persistence are the mental-data element too.



[29.] The inferior, medium, and superior elements are the
eighteen elements themselves; for inferior eyes, etc., are the inferior
element, and medium and superior eyes, etc., are the medium and superior
elements. But literally speaking, the unprofitable mental-data element
and mind-consciousness element are the inferior element; both these
elements, when mundane profitable or mundane indeterminate, and the eye
element, etc., are the medium element; but the supramundane mental-data
element and mind-consciousness element are the superior element.



[30.]The earth, fire, and air elements are the tangible-data
element; the water element and the space element are the mental-data
element only; "consciousness element" is a term summarizing the seven
consciousness elements beginning with eye-consciousness.



[31.]Seventeen elements and one part of the mental-data element
are the formed element; but the unformed element is one part of the
mental-data element only. The "world of many elements, of various
elements" is merely what is divided up into the eighteen elements.



14\. "It is the mere cessation of the mind-consciousness element and
mental-data element because it is the ceasedness of thought-arisings in
the fourth immaterial state" (Vism-mhṭ 514).



[]



[]



So they are given as eighteen because, as to individual essence, all
existing



elements are included in that \[classification\].



[32.]Furthermore, they are stated as eighteen for the purpose
of eliminating the kind of perception to be found in those who perceive
a soul in consciousness, the individual essence of which is cognizing;
for there are beings who perceive a soul in consciousness, the
individual essence of which is cognizing. And so the Blessed One, who
was desirous of eliminating the long-inherent perception of a soul, has
expounded the eighteen elements thus making evident to them not only
consciousness's multiplicity when classed as eye-, ear-, nose-, tongue-
and body-consciousness elements, and mind, and mind-consciousness
elements, but also its impermanence, which is due to its existing in
dependence on eye- cum-visible-data, etc., as conditions.



[33.]What is more, the inclinations of those who are teachable
in this way \[have to be considered\]; and in order to suit the
inclinations of beings who are teachable by a teaching that is neither
too brief nor too long, eighteen are expounded. For:



By methods terse and long as need may be\
He taught the Dhamma, so that from beings' hearts,\
If they have wit to learn, the dark departs\
Melting in the Good Dhamma's brilliancy.



This is how the exposition should be understood here as to just so much.



[34.] *5.* *As to reckoning*: the eye-element, firstly, is
reckoned as one thing according to kind, \[488\] namely, eye
sensitivity. Likewise, the ear, nose, tongue, body, visible- data,
sound, odour, and flavour elements are reckoned as ear sensitivity, and
so on (XIV.37ff.). But the tangible-data element is reckoned as three
things, namely, earth, fire and air. The eye-consciousness element is
reckoned as two things, namely, profitable and unprofitable
kamma-result; and likewise the conscious- ness elements of the ear,
nose, tongue, and body. The mind element is reckoned as three things,
namely, five-door adverting (70), and profitable (39) and unprofitable
(55) resultant receiving. The mental-data element as twenty things,
namely, three immaterial aggregates, sixteen kinds of subtle matter, and
the unformed element (see Vibh 88).15 Mind-consciousness element is
reckoned as seventy-six things, namely, the remaining profitable,
unprofitable, and indeterminate consciousnesses. This is how the
exposition should be understood as to reckoning.



[35.] *6. Condition*: the eye element, firstly, is a condition,
in six ways, namely,



dissociation, pre-nascence, presence, non-disappearance, support, and
faculty



15\. In XIV.35--70, the material instances listed total 28, that is, 4
primary elements, 9 sense faculties (excluding the tangible-data
faculty, which is the 3 elements except water), and 15 kinds of subtle
materiality beginning with the femininity faculty (cf. treatment at Dhs
§596). Other lists, however, sometimes give a total of 26 kinds, that
is, 10 sense faculties (including the tangible-data faculty, which is
the 3 primary elements) and 16 kinds of subtle materiality, that is, the
above-mentioned 15 plus the water element, which is listed then after
the space element (cf. treatment at Dhs §653 and list at M-a II 261).
See Table I.

[]



for the eye-consciousness element. The visible-data element is a
condition, in four ways, namely, prenascence, presence,
non-disappearance, and object, for the eye-consciousness element.
Similarly with the ear-element and the sound- element for the
ear-consciousness element and so on.



[36.] The adverting mind element (70) is a condition, as the
five conditions, namely: proximity, contiguity, absence, disappearance,
and proximity-decisive- support, for these five \[beginning with the
eye-consciousness element\]. And these five are so too for the receiving
mind element ((39), (55)). And so is the receiving mind element for the
investigating mind-consciousness element ((40), (41), (56)). And so is
that too for the determining mind-consciousness element (71). And so is
the determining mind-consciousness element for impulsion mind-
consciousness element. But the impulsion mind-consciousness element is a
condition, as the six conditions, namely, as the five already stated and
as repetition condition, for the immediately following impulsion
mind-consciousness element.



This, firstly, is the way in the case of the five doors.



[37.] In the case of the mind door, however, the life-continuum
mind- consciousness element is a condition, as the previously-stated
five conditions, for the adverting mind-consciousness element (71). And
the adverting mind- consciousness element is so for the impulsion
mind-consciousness element.



[38.] The mental-data element is a condition in many ways, as
conascence, mutuality, support, association, presence,
non-disappearance, etc.,16 for the seven consciousness elements. The eye
element, etc., and some of the mental-data element,17 are conditions, as
object condition, etc., for some of the mind- consciousness element.



[39.] And not only are the eye and visible data, etc.,
conditions for the eye- consciousness element, etc., \[respectively\],
but also light, etc., are too. Hence the former teachers said:
"Eye-consciousness arises due to eye, visible datum, light, and
attention. \[489\] Ear-consciousness arises due to ear, sound, aperture,
and attention. Nose-consciousness arises due to nose, odour, air, and
attention. Tongue-consciousness arises due to tongue, flavour, water,
and attention. Body- consciousness arises due to body, tangible datum,
earth, and attention. Mind- consciousness arises due to
life-continuum-mind,18 mental datum, and attention."



This is in brief. But the kinds of conditions will be explained in
detail in the



Description of Dependent Origination (XVII.66ff.).



This is how the exposition should be understood here as to condition.



[40.] *7. How to be seen*: the meaning is that here too the
exposition should be



understood as to how they are to be regarded. For all formed elements
are to be



16\. "Here the word 'etc.' stands for the mind-consciousness element's
states where suitable as root-cause, predominance, kamma, kamma-result,
nutriment, faculty, jhāna, and path conditions" (Vism-mhṭ 516).\



17\. "I.e. subtle materiality and Nibbāna" (Vism-mhṭ 516).\



18\. "'*Life-continuum mind*' is the life-continuum consciousness
occurring twice in disturbance" (Vism-mhṭ 516).



[]



[]



regarded as secluded from the past and future,19 as void of any
lastingness, beauty, pleasure, or self, and as existing in dependence on
conditions.



[41.]Individually, however, the eye element should be regarded
as the surface of a drum, the visible-data element as the drumstick, and
the eye-consciousness element as the sound. Likewise, the eye element
should be regarded as the surface of a looking-glass, the visible-data
element as the face, and the eye-consciousness element as the image of
the face. Or else, the eye-element should be regarded as sugarcane or
sesame, the visible-data element as the \[sugarcane\] mill or the
\[sesame\] wheel rod, and the eye-consciousness element as the sugarcane
juice or the sesame oil. Likewise, the eye-element should be regarded as
the lower fire- stick, the visible-data element as the upper
fire-stick,20 and the eye-consciousness element as the fire. So too in
the case of the ear and so on.



[42.] The mind element, however, should be regarded as the
forerunner and



follower of eye-consciousness, etc., as that arises.



As to the mental-data element, the feeling aggregate should be regarded
as a dart and as a stake, the perception and formations aggregates as a
disease owing to their connection with the dart and stake of feeling. Or
the ordinary man's perception should be regarded as an empty fist
because it produces pain through \[disappointed\] desire; or as a forest
deer \[with a scarecrow\] because it apprehends the sign incorrectly.
And the formations aggregate should be regarded as men who throw one
into a pit of hot coals, because they throw one into rebirth-linking, or
as thieves pursued by the king's men because they are pursued by the
pains of birth; or as the seeds of a poison-tree, because they are the
root-cause of the aggregates' continuity, which brings all kinds of
harm. And materiality should be regarded as a razor-wheel (see J-a IV
3), because it is the sign of various kinds of dangers.



The unformed element, however, should be regarded as deathless, as
peace,



as safety. Why? Because it is the opposite of all ill. \[490\]



[43.]The mind-consciousness element should be regarded as a
forest monkey, because it does not stay still on its object; or as a
wild horse, because it is difficult to tame; or as a stick flung into
the air, because it falls anyhow; or as a stage dancer, because it
adopts the guise of the various defilements such as greed and hate.

future) because their individual essences are unapprehendable then"

## CHAPTER XVI 


THE FACULTIES AND TRUTHS



(*Indriya-sacca-niddesa*)



\[A. DESCRIPTION OF THE FACULTIES\]



[1.]\[491\] The "faculties" listed next to the elements
(XIV.32) are the twenty-two faculties, namely, eye faculty, ear faculty,
nose faculty, tongue faculty, body faculty, mind faculty, femininity
faculty, masculinity faculty, life faculty, \[bodily\] pleasure faculty,
\[bodily\] pain faculty, \[mental\] joy faculty, \[mental\] grief
faculty, equanimity faculty, faith faculty, energy faculty, mindfulness
faculty, concentration faculty, understanding faculty,
"I-shall-come-to-know-the-unknown" faculty, final- knowledge faculty,
final-knower faculty.



[2.] Herein:



[(l)] As to meaning, (2) character and so on, (3) Order, (4)
divided and undivided,\
(5) Likewise function, and (6) also plane---\
The exposition should be known.



[3.] Herein, firstly, the *meaning* of eye, etc.,
is explained in the way beginning: "It relishes (*cakkhati*), thus it is
an eye (*cakkhu*)" (XV.3). But as regards the last three, the first is
called the "I-shall-come-to-know-the-unknown" faculty because it arises
in the initial stage \[of the stream-entry path moment\] in one who has
entered on the way thus "I shall come to know the deathless state, or
the Dhamma of the Four (Noble) Truths, not known,"1 and because it
carries the meaning of faculty (rulership). The second of them is called
the final-knowledge faculty because of knowing finally, and because it
carries the meaning of faculty. The third is called the final-knower
faculty because it arises in one who has destroyed cankers, who
possesses final knowledge, and whose task of getting to know the four
truths is finished, and because it carries the meaning of faculty.



[4.]But what is this meaning of faculty
(rulership---*indriyattha*) that they have? (a) The meaning of being the
mark of a ruler (*inda*) is the meaning of faculty (rulership). (b) The
meaning of being taught by a ruler is the meaning of faculty, (c) The
meaning of being seen by a ruler is the meaning of faculty, (d) The
meaning of having been prepared by a ruler is the meaning of faculty,
(e) The



1\. "In the noble path moment's initial stage" (Vism-mhṭ 519).


[]



[]



meaning of having been fostered by a ruler is the meaning of faculty.2
And all that applies here in one instance or another.



[5.] The Blessed One, Fully Enlightened, is a ruler (*inda*)* *
because of supreme lordship*.* And so is kamma, profitable and
unprofitable; for no one has lordship over the kinds of kamma*.* So
here, the faculties (*indriya*), \[492\] which are created by kamma,
*are the mark* of profitable and unprofitable kamma. And since they are
*prepared* by it, they are faculties in the sense of (a) *being the mark
of a ruler* and (d) in the sense of *having been prepared by a ruler.*
But since they have also been correctly made evident and disclosed by
the Blessed One, they are all faculties (b) in the sense of *being
taught by a ruler* and (c) in the sense of *being seen by a ruler*. And
since some of them were cultivated by the Blessed One, Ruler of Sages,
in his cultivation of domain and some in his cultivation of development,
they are faculties (e) in the sense of *being fostered by a ruler*.



[6.] Furthermore, they are faculties (rulership) in the sense
of lordship called predominance. For predominance of the eye, etc., is
implied in the occurrence of eye-consciousness, etc., because of the
(consciousness') keenness when that \[faculty\] is keen and slowness
when it is slow.



This, firstly, is the exposition as to meaning.



[7.]*2. As to character and so on*: the meaning is that the
exposition of the eye and so on should be known according to
characteristic, function, manifestation, proximate cause, and so on. But
these characteristics, etc., of theirs are given above in the
Description of the Aggregates (XIV.37ff.). For the four beginning with
the understanding faculty are simply non-delusion as to meaning. The
rest are each given there as such.



[8.] *3.*  *As to order:* this too is only order of teaching
(see XIV.211). Herein, the noble plane \[which is the stage of
stream-entry, etc.\] is attained through the full- understanding of
internal states, and so the eye faculty and the rest included in the
selfhood are taught first. Then the femininity faculty and masculinity
faculty, to show on what account that selfhood is called "woman" or
"man." Next, the life faculty, to make it known that although that
selfhood is twofold, still its existence is bound up with the life
faculty. Next the \[bodily-\] pleasure faculty, etc., to make it known
that there is no remission of these feelings as long as that
\[selfhood\] continues, and that all feeling is \[ultimately\]
suffering. Next, the faith faculty, etc., to show the way, since these
things are to be developed in order to make that \[suffering\] cease.
Next, the "I-shall-come-to*-*know*-*the*-*unknown" faculty to show that
the way is not sterile, since it is through this way that this state is
first manifested in oneself. Next, the final*-*knowledge faculty,
because it is the fruit of the last*-*mentioned faculty and so must be
developed after it. Next, the final*-*knower faculty, the supreme
reward, is taught last to make it known that it



2\. The words *siṭṭha* (prepared---*sajjita, uppādita* Vism-mhṭ 520),
and *juṭṭha* (fostered---*sevita*, Vism-mhṭ 520) are not in PED. The
Pali is: *indaliṅgaṭṭho indriyaṭṭho, indadesitaṭṭho indriyaṭṭho,
indadiṭṭhaṭṭho indriyaṭṭho, indasiṭṭhaṭṭho indriyaṭṭho, indajuṭṭhaṭṭho
indriyaṭṭho*; cf. *Pāṇini* V 2,93: *Indriyam indraliṅgam indradºåṭam
indrasºåṭam indrajuåṭam indradattam iti vā*.



[]



[]



is attained by development, and that when it is attained there is
nothing more to be done. This is the order here. \[493\]



[9.] *As to divided and undivided*: here there is
only division of the life faculty; for that is twofold as the
material-life faculty and the immaterial-life faculty. There is no
division of the others.



This is how the exposition should be known here as to divided and
undivided.



[10.] *5.* *As to function:* what is the faculties' function?
Firstly, because of the words "The eye base is a condition, as faculty
condition, for the eye-consciousness element and for the states
associated therewith" (Paṭṭh 1.5) the eye faculty's function is to cause
by its own keenness, slowness, etc., the occurrence of eye-
consciousness and associated states, etc., in a mode parallel to its
own,3 which is called their keenness, slowness, etc., this function
being accomplishable through the state of faculty condition. So too in
the case of the ear, nose, tongue, and body. But the function of the
mind faculty is to make conascent states subject to its own mastery.
That of the life faculty is to maintain conascent states. That of the
femininity faculty and the masculinity faculty is to allot the modes of
the mark, sign, work and ways of women and men. That of the faculties of
pleasure, pain, joy, and grief is to govern conascent states and impart
their own particular mode of grossness to those states. That of the
equanimity faculty is to impart to them the mode of quiet, superiority
and neutrality. That of the faculties of faith, etc., is to overcome
opposition and to impart to associated states the mode of confidence and
so on. That of the "I-shall-come-to-know-the-unknown" faculty is both to
abandon three fetters and to confront associated states with the
abandonment of them. That of the final-knowledge faculty is both to
attenuate and abandon respectively lust, ill will, etc., and to subject
conascent states to its own mastery*.* That of the final-knower faculty
is both to abandon endeavour in all functions and to condition
associated states by confronting them with the Deathless.



This is how the exposition should be known here as to function.



[11.] *6.*  *As to plane*: the faculties of eye, ear, nose,
tongue, body, femininity, masculinity, pleasure, pain, and grief are of
the sense sphere only. The mind faculty, life faculty, and equanimity
faculty, and the faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration,
and understanding are included in the four planes. The joy faculty is
included in three planes, namely, sense sphere, fine-material sphere,
and supramundane. The last three are supramundane only. This is how the
exposition should be known here as to plane.



The monk who knows the urgent need\
To keep the faculties restrained\
By fully understanding them\
Will make an end of suffering.



[12.]This is the section of the detailed explanation dealing
with the faculties*.*



3\. *Anuvattāpana---*"causing occurrence parallel to": not in PED; not
in CPD.

[]



\[B. DESCRIPTION OF THE TRUTHS\]



[13.]\[494\] The "truths" next to that (XIV.32) are the Four
Noble Truths; that is to say, the noble truth of suffering, the noble
truth of the origin of suffering, the noble truth of the cessation of
suffering, the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of
suffering.



[14.] Herein:



\(1\) As to class, and (2) derivation,\
(3) Division by character, et cetera,\
(4) As to meaning, (5) tracing out meaning,\
And likewise (6) neither less nor more,\
(7) As to order, (8) as to expounding\
Birth and so on, (9) knowledge's function,\
(10) As to division of the content,\
(11) As to a simile, and (12) tetrad,\
(13) As to void, (14) singlefold and so on,\
(15) Similar and dissimilar---\
Thus should be known the exposition\
By those who know the teaching's order.



[15.] *1.* Herein, *as to class*: the meanings of \[the truths
of\] suffering, etc., are analyzed as four in each case that are "real,
not unreal, not otherwise" (S V 435) and must be penetrated by those
penetrating suffering, etc., according as it is said: "Suffering's
meaning of oppressing, meaning of being formed, meaning of burning,
meaning of changing, these are suffering's four meanings of suffering,
which are real, not unreal, not otherwise. Origin's meaning of
accumulating, meaning of source, meaning of bondage, meaning of impeding
... Cessation's meaning of escape, meaning of seclusion, meaning of
being unformed, meaning of deathlessness ... The path's meaning of
outlet, meaning of cause, meaning of seeing, meaning of predominance,
these are the path's meanings of path, which are real, not unreal, not
otherwise" (Paṭis II 104; cf. Paṭis I 19). Likewise, "Suffering's
meaning of oppressing, meaning of being formed, meaning of burning,
meaning of change, are its meaning of penetration to" (cf. Paṭis I 118),
and so on. So suffering, etc., should be understood according to the
four meanings analyzed in each case.



[16.] *2.* *As to derivation,* 3. *division by character, et
cetera:* here, however, firstly "as to derivation" \[of the word
*dukkha* (suffering):\] the word *du* ("bad") is met with in the sense
of vile (*kucchita*); for they call a vile child a *du*-*putta* ("bad
child"). The word *kham* ("-ness"), however is met with in the sense of
empty (*tuccha*), for they call empty space "*kham*." And the first
truth is vile because it is the haunt of many dangers, and it is empty
because it is devoid of the lastingness, beauty, pleasure, and self
conceived by rash people*. * So it is called *dukkhaṃ * ("badness" =
suffering, pain), because of vileness and emptiness. \[495\]



[17.] \[*Samudaya* (origin):\] the word *sam* (= prefix
"con*-*") denotes connection, as in the words *samāgama* (concourse,
coming together), *sameta* (congregated, gone together), and so on. The
word *u * denotes rising up, as in the words *uppanna* (arisen,
uprisen), *udita* (ascended, gone up), and so on. The word *aya*4
denotes a



[]



[]



reason (*kāraṇa*). And this second truth is the reason for the arising
of suffering when combined with the remaining conditions. So it is
called *dukkha*-*samudaya* (the origin of suffering) because it is the
reason in combination for the arising of suffering.



[18.]\[*Nirodha * (cessation):\] the word *ni * denotes
absence, and the word *rodha*, a prison.5 Now, the third truth is void
of all destinies \[by rebirth\] and so there is no constraint (*rodha*)
of suffering here reckoned as the prison of the round of rebirths; or
when that cessation has been arrived at, there is no more constraint of
suffering reckoned as the prison of the round of rebirths. And being the
opposite of that prison, it is called *dukkha*-*nirodha * (cessation of
suffering). Or alternatively, it is called "cessation of suffering"* *
because it is a condition for the cessation of suffering consisting in
non*-*arising.



[19.] \[*Nirodhagāminī paṭipadā* (way leading to cessation):\]
because the fourth truth goes (leads) to the cessation of suffering
since it confronts that \[cessation\] as its object, and being the way
to attain cessation of suffering, it is called *dukkha*-
*nirodha*-*gāminī paṭipadā*, the way leading to the cessation of
suffering.



[20.]They are called Noble Truths because the Noble Ones, the
Buddhas, etc., penetrate them, according as it is said: "Bhikkhus, there
are these Four Noble Truths. What four? ... These, bhikkhus are the Four
Noble Truths" (S V 425). The Noble Ones penetrate them, therefore they
are called Noble Truths.



[21.] Besides, the Noble Truths are the Noble One's Truths,
according as it is said: "Bhikkhus, in the world with its deities, its
Māras and its Brahmās, in this generation with its ascetics and
brahmans, with its princes and men, the Perfect One is the Noble One.
That is why they are called Noble Truths" (S V 435). Or alternatively,
they are called Noble Truths because of the nobleness implied by their
discovery, according as it is said: "Bhikkhus, it is owing to the
correct discovery of these Four Noble Truths that the Perfect One is
called accomplished, fully enlightened" (S V 433).



[22.]Besides, the Noble Truths are the Truths that are Noble.
To be noble is to be not unreal; the meaning is, not deceptive,
according as it is said: "Bhikkhus, these Four Noble Truths are real,
not unreal, not otherwise that is why they are called Noble Truths" (S V
435).



This is how the exposition should be known here as to derivation.



[23.] *3.*  *How as to division by character, et cetera*? The
truth of suffering has the characteristic of afflicting. \[496\] Its
function is to burn. It is manifested as occurrence (as the course of an
existence). The truth of origin has the characteristic of producing. Its
function is to prevent interruption. It is manifested as impediment. The
truth of cessation has the characteristic of peace. Its function is not
to die. It is manifested as the signless.6 The truth of the path has the



4\. *Aya---*"reason": not in PED in this sense.\



5\. *Cāraka---*"prison": not in PED in this sense; see XIV.221.



6\. "'*Signless*': being secluded from the sign of the five aggregates,
it is taken as having no graspable entity (*aviggaha*)" (Vism-mhṭ 525).



[]



[]



characteristic of an outlet. Its function is to abandon defilements. It
is manifested as emergence. They have, moreover, the respective
characteristics of occurrence, making occur, non-occurrence, and making
not occur, and likewise the characteristics of the formed, craving, the
unformed, and seeing. This is how the exposition should be understood
here as to characteristic, et cetera.



[24.] *4.* *As to meaning,* 5. *tracing out the meaning*: as to
"meaning" firstly, what is the "meaning of truth" (*saccattha*)? It is
that which, for those who examine it with the eye of understanding, is
not misleading like an illusion, deceptive like a mirage, or
undiscoverable like the self of the sectarians, but is rather the domain
of noble knowledge as the real unmisleading actual state with its
aspects of affliction, production, quiet, and outlet. It is this real
unmisleading actualness that should be understood as the "meaning of
truth" just as \[heat is\] the characteristic of fire, and just as \[it
is\] in the nature of the world \[that things are subject to birth,
ageing and death\], according as it is said, "Bhikkhus, this suffering
is real, not unreal, not otherwise" (S V 430), and so on, in detail.



[25.] Furthermore:



There is no pain but is affliction.\
And naught that is not pain afflicts:\
This certainty that it afflicts\
Is what is reckoned here as truth.



No other source of pain than craving.\
Nor aught that source provides but pain:\
This certainty in causing pain\
Is why it is considered truth.



There is no peace except Nibbāna



,



Nibbāna cannot but be peace:\
This certainty that it is peace\
Is what is reckoned here as truth.



No outlet other than the path.\
Nor fails the path to be the outlet:\
Its status as the very outlet\
Has made it recognized as truth.



This real infallibility.\
Which is their true essential core.\
Is what the wise declare to be\
Truth's meaning common to all four.



This is how the exposition should be understood as to meaning.



[26.] *5.* *How as to tracing out the meaning*? This word
"truth" (*sacca*) is met with in various meanings. In such passages as
"Let him speak truth and not be angry" (Dhp 224) it is verbal truth. In
such passages as "Ascetics and brahmans base themselves on truth" (?) it
is the truth of abstinence \[from lying\]. In such passages as \[497\]
"Why do they declare diverse truths, the clever talkers that hold
forth?" (Sn 885) it is truth as views. And in such passages as "Truth is
one, there is no second" (Sn 884) it is, as truth in the ultimate sense,
both Nibbāna and the path.



[]



[]



In such passages as "Of the four truths how many are profitable?" (Vibh
112; Paṭis II 108) it is noble truth. And here too it is proper as noble
truth.



This is how the exposition should be understood as to tracing out the
meaning.



[27.]*6. As to neither less nor more:* but why are exactly four
noble truths stated, neither less nor more? Because no other exists and
because none can be eliminated. For there is none extra to them, nor can
any one of them be eliminated, according as it is said: "Bhikkhus, that
an ascetic or brahman here should come and say: 'This is not the truth
of suffering, the truth of suffering is another; I shall set aside this
truth of suffering and make known another truth of suffering'---that is
not possible" (?) and so on, and according as it is said: "Bhikkhus,
that any ascetic or brahman should say thus: 'This is not the first
noble truth of suffering that is taught by the ascetic Gotama; rejecting
this first noble truth of suffering, I shall make known another first
noble truth of suffering'---that is not possible" (S V 428) and so on.



[28.]Furthermore, when announcing occurrence, \[that is, the
process of existence,\] the Blessed One announced it with a cause, and
he announced non*-*occurrence as having a means thereto. So they are
stated as four at the most as occurrence and non*-*occurrence and the
cause of each. Likewise, they are stated as four since they have to be
respectively fully understood, abandoned, realized, and developed; and
also since they are the basis for craving, craving, the cessation of
craving, and the means to the cessation of craving; and also since they
are the reliance \[depended upon\], the delight in the reliance, removal
of the reliance, and the means to the removal of the reliance*.*



This is how the exposition should be understood here as to neither less
nor



more*.*



[29.]*7. As to order,* this too is only order of teaching (see
XIV.211)*. * The truth of suffering is given first since it is easy to
understand because of its grossness and because it is common to all
living beings*.* The truth of origin is given next to show its cause*. *
Then the truth of cessation, to make it known that with the cessation of
the cause there is the cessation of the fruit*. * The truth of the path
comes last to show the means to achieve that. \[498\]



[30.]Or alternatively, he announced the truth of suffering
first to instill a sense of urgency into living beings caught up in the
enjoyment of the pleasure of becoming; and next to that, the truth of
origin to make it known that that \[suffering\] neither comes about of
itself as something not made nor is it due to creation by an Overlord,
etc. (see §85), but that on the contrary it is due to this \[cause\];
after that, cessation, to instill comfort by showing the escape to those
who seek the escape from suffering with a sense of urgency because
overwhelmed by suffering with its cause. And after that, the path that
leads to cessation, to enable them to attain cessation. This is how the
exposition should be understood here as to order.



[31.] *8.*  *As to expounding birth and so on:* the exposition
should be understood here in accordance with the expositions of the
things beginning with birth given by the Blessed One when describing the
Four Noble Truths, that is to say,



[]



[]



[(i)] the twelve things in the description of suffering: "Birth
is suffering, ageing is suffering,7 death is suffering, sorrow,
lamentation, pain, grief, and despair are suffering, association with
the unloved is suffering, separation from the loved is suffering, not to
get what one wants is suffering, in short, the five aggregates \[as
objects\] of clinging are suffering" (Vibh 99); and (ii) the threefold
craving in the description of origin: "That craving which produces
further becoming, is accompanied by delight and greed, delighting in
this and that, that is to say, craving for sense desires, craving for
becoming, craving for non-becoming" (Vibh 101); and (iii) Nibbāna, which
has one meaning only, in the description of cessation: "That which is
the remainderless fading away and cessation of that same craving, giving
it up, relinquishing it, letting it go, not relying on it" (Vibh 103);
and (iv) the eight things in the description of the path: "What is the
noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering? It is this
Noble Eightfold Path, that is to say, right view, right thinking, right
speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness,
right concentration" (Vibh 104).



\[THE TRUTH OF SUFFERING\]



\[(I) BIRTH\]



[32.] Now, this word birth (*jāti*) has many meanings. For in
the passage "\[He recollects ... \] one birth (*jāti*), two births" (D I
81) it is becoming. In the passage, "Visākhā, there is a kind (*jāti*)
of ascetics called Nigaṇṭhas (Jains)" (A I 206) it is a monastic order.
In the passage, "Birth (*jāti*) is included in two aggregates" (Dhātuk
15) it is the characteristic of whatever is formed. In the passage, "His
birth is due to the first consciousness arisen, the first cognition
manifested, in the mother's womb" (Vin I 93) it is rebirth-linking.
\[499\] In the passage "As soon as he was born (*sampatijāta*), Ānanda,
the Bodhisatta ..." (M III 123) it is parturition. In the passage "One
who is not rejected and despised on account of birth" (A III 152) it is
clan*.* In the passage "Sister, since I was born with the noble birth"
(M II 103) it is the Noble One's virtue*.*



[33.]Here it should be regarded as the aggregates that occur
from the time of rebirth-linking up to the exit from the mother's womb
in the case of the womb- born, and as only the aggregates of
rebirth-linking in the case of the rest*. * But this is only an indirect
treatment*. * In the direct sense, however, it is the first
manifestation of any aggregates that are manifested in living beings
when they are born anywhere that is called "birth."



[34.]Its characteristic is the first genesis in any \[sphere
of\] becoming. Its function is to consign \[to a sphere of becoming\].
It is manifested as an emerging here from a past becoming; or it is
manifested as the variedness of suffering.



7\. "Sickness is not included here (as at D II 305 for example) because
no particular person is meant, and there are persons in whom sickness
does not arise at all, like the venerable Bakkula (MN 124); otherwise it
may be taken as already included by suffering itself; for in the
ultimate sense sickness is bodily pain conditioned by disturbance of
elements"* * (Vism-mhṭ 527).



[]



[]



But why is it suffering? Because it is the basis for many kinds of
suffering.8 For there are many kinds of suffering, that is to say,
intrinsic suffering (*dukkha*- *dukkha*),9 suffering in change
(*vipariṇāma*-*dukkha*), and suffering due to formations
(*saṅkhāra*-*dukkha*); and then concealed suffering, exposed suffering,
indirect suffering, and direct suffering.



[35.] Herein, bodily and mental, painful feeling are called
*intrinsic suffering* because of their individual essence, their name,
and their painfulness. \[Bodily and mental\] pleasant feeling are called
*suffering in change* because they are a cause for the arising of pain
when they change (M I 303). Equanimous feeling and the remaining
formations of the three planes are called *suffering due to formations*
because they are oppressed by rise and fall. Such bodily and mental
affliction as earache, toothache, fever born of lust, fever born of
hate, etc., is called *concealed suffering* because it can only be known
by questioning and because the infliction is not openly evident; it is
also called "unevident suffering." The affliction produced by the
thirty*-*two tortures,10 etc., is called *exposed suffering* because it
can be known without questioning and because the infliction is openly
evident; it is also called "evident suffering." Except intrinsic
suffering, all given in the exposition of the truth of suffering \[in
the Vibhaṅga\] (Vibh 99) beginning



8\. "The question, "*But why is it suffering*?" means this: granted
firstly that birth in hell is painful, since hell is unalloyed pain, and
that it is painful in the other unhappy destinies since it is originated
by bad kamma; but how is it so in the happy destinies since it is there
originated by kamma that leads to bliss? The answer, "*Because it is the
basis for many kinds of suffering*", etc., shows that this birth is not
called suffering because of having suffering as its individual
essence---for there is no rebirth*-*linking associated with painful
feeling---but rather because it is the foundation for suffering"
(Vism-mhṭ 528).\
Something must be said here about the words *dukkha* and *sukha,* the
former being perhaps the hardest after *dhamma* to render into English.
*Dukkha* is consistently rendered by either the vaguer general term
"suffering" or by the more specific "\[bodily\] pain." Different, but
overlapping, ideas are expressed. The latter needs no explanation; but
"suffering" must be stretched to include the general insecurity of the
whole of experience, of the impermanent world. For this, "uneasiness"
would certainly be preferable ("ill" is sometimes used), but
multiplication of renderings is to be avoided as much as possible; local
accuracy is only too often gained at the cost of general disorientation
in a work of this sort, with these very general words capable of sharp
focusing. Again, *sukha* has been rendered as either "bliss" or
"pleasure," though the latter does not at all necessarily imply any
hedonism construed with sensual pleasure (*kāma*). Again, "ease" (in the
sense of relief) is in many ways preferable for the first sense but has
not been used for the reason already given.



9\. "Since also what does not have suffering as its individual essence
is yet called suffering indirectly, consequently 'intrinsic suffering'
(*dukkha*-*dukkha*) is said particularizing what does have suffering as
its individual essence, just as in the case of particularizing 'concrete
matter'" (*rūpa-rūpa*) (see 14.77) (Vism-mhṭ 528). For these three kinds
see S IV 259.\



10\. See MN 13 and 129, though it is not clear where the figure
"thirty-two" is taken from.

with birth are also called *indirect suffering* because they are the
basis for one kind of suffering or another. But intrinsic suffering is
called *direct suffering*.



[36.]Herein, this birth is suffering because it is the basis
for the suffering in the states of loss as made evident by the Blessed
One by means of a simile in the Bālapaṇḍita Sutta (M III 165f.), etc.,
and for the suffering that arises in the happy destinies in the human
world and is classed as "rooted in the descent into the womb," and so
on. \[500\]



[37.]Here the suffering classed as "rooted in the descent into
the womb," and so on, is this: When this being is born in the mother's
womb, he is not born inside a blue or red or white lotus, etc., but on
the contrary, like a worm in rotting fish, rotting dough, cesspools,
etc., he is born in the belly in a position that is below the receptacle
for undigested food (stomach), above the receptacle for digested food
(rectum), between the belly-lining and the backbone, which is very
cramped, quite dark, pervaded by very fetid draughts redolent of various
smells of ordure, and exception-ally loathsome.11 And on being reborn
there, for ten months he undergoes excessive suffering, being cooked
like a pudding in a bag by the heat produced in the mother's womb, and
steamed like a dumpling of dough, with no bending, stretching, and so
on. So this, firstly, is the suffering rooted in the descent into the
womb.



[38.]When the mother suddenly stumbles or moves or sits down or
gets up or turns round, the extreme suffering he undergoes by being
dragged back and forth and jolted up and down, like a kid fallen into
the hands of a drunkard, or like a snake's young fallen into the hands
of a snake*-*charmer; and also the searing pain that he undergoes, as
though he had reappeared in the cold hells, when his mother drinks cold
water, and as though deluged by a rain of embers when she swallows hot
rice gruel, rice, etc., and as though undergoing the torture of the
"lye*-*pickling" (see M I 87), when she swallows anything salty or
acidic, etc.---this is the suffering rooted in gestation.



[39.]When the mother has an abortion, the pain that arises in
him through the cutting and rending in the place where the pain arises
that is not fit to be seen even by friends and intimates and
companions---this is the suffering rooted in abortion.



[40.]The pain that arises in him when the mother gives birth,
through his being turned upside*-*down by the kamma*-*produced winds
\[forces\] and flung into that most fearful passage from the womb, like
an infernal chasm, and lugged out through the extremely narrow mouth of
the womb, like an elephant through a keyhole, like a denizen of hell
being pounded to pulp by colliding rocks---this is the suffering rooted
in parturition.



11\. *Pavana---*"stench": not in PED, in this sense. The
*Sammohavinodanī* (Be) reproducing this passage inserts the word
*asuci * (impurity), lacking in Ee and Ae eds. of Vism. *Kuṇapa* is only
given the meaning of "corpse or carcass" in PED; but Vism-mhṭ says,
"various ordures (*kuṇapa*) such as bile, phlegm, pus, blood, excrement,
gorge and so on" (Vism-mhṭ 529). "Whether the mother is \[twenty\],
\[thirty\], or \[forty\] years old, it is '*as exceptionally loathsome*'
as an excrement bucket that has not been washed for a like number of
years" (Vism-mhṭ 529).



[]



[]



[41.] The pain that arises in him after he is born, and his
body, which is as delicate as a tender wound, is taken in the hands,
bathed, washed, rubbed with cloths, etc., and which pain is like being
pricked with needle points and gashed with razor blades, etc.---this is
the suffering rooted in venturing outside the mother's womb. \[501\]



[42.]The pain that arises afterwards during the course of
existence in one who punishes himself, in one who devotes himself to the
practice of mortification and austerity according to the vows of the
naked ascetics, in one who starves through anger, and in one who hangs
himself---this is the suffering rooted in self-violence.



[43.] And that arising in one who undergoes flogging,
imprisonment, etc., at



the hands of others is the suffering rooted in others' violence.



So this birth is the basis for all this suffering. Hence this is said:



Now, were no being born in hell again\
The pain unbearable of scorching fires\
And all the rest would then no footing gain;\
Therefore the Sage pronounced that birth is pain.



Many the sorts of pain that beasts endure\
When they are flogged with whips and sticks and goads,\
Since birth among them does this pain procure,\
Birth there is pain: the consequence is sure.



While ghosts know pain in great variety\
Through hunger, thirst, wind, sun and what not too,\
None, unless born there, knows this misery;\
So birth the Sage declares this pain to be.



In the world-interspace, where demons dwell\
In searing cold and inspissated gloom,\
Is pain requiring birth there for its spell;\
So with the birth the pain ensues as well.



The horrible torment a being feels on coming out,\
When he has spent long months shut up inside the



mother's womb---



A hellish tomb of excrement---would never come about\
Without rebirth: that birth is pain there is no room for doubt.



But why elaborate? At any time or anywhere\
Can there exist a painful state if birth do not precede?\
Indeed this Sage so great, when he expounded pain,



took care



First to declare rebirth as pain, the condition needed there.



This, firstly, is the exposition of birth. \[502\]



[]



[]



\[(II) AGEING\]



[44.] *Ageing is suffering*: ageing is twofold; as a
characteristic of whatever is formed, and in the case of a continuity,
as the oldness of aggregates included in a single becoming, which
oldness is known as "brokenness" and so on (see M III 249). The latter
is intended here.



But this ageing has as its characteristic the maturing (ripening) of
aggregates. Its function is to lead on to death. It is manifested as the
vanishing of youth. It is suffering because of the suffering due to
formations and because it is a basis for suffering.



[45.]Ageing is the basis for the bodily and mental suffering
that arises owing to many conditions such as leadenness in all the
limbs, decline and warping of the faculties, vanishing of youth,
undermining of strength, loss of memory and intelligence, contempt on
the part of others, and so on.



Hence this is said:



With leadenness in every limb,\
With every faculty declining,\
With vanishing of youthfulness,\
With memory and wit grown dim,



With strength now drained by undermining,\
With growing unattractiveness\
To wife and family and then\
With dotage coming on, what pain



Alike of body and of mind\
A mortal must expect to find!\
Since ageing all of this will bring,\
Ageing is well named suffering.



This is the exposition of ageing.



\[(III) DEATH\]



[46.] *Death is suffering*: death too is twofold, as a
characteristic of the formed, with reference to which it is said,
"Ageing and death are included in the aggregates" (Dhātuk 15), and as
the severing of the connection of the life faculty included in a single
becoming, with reference to which it is said, "So mortals are in
constant fear ... that they will die" (Sn 576). The latter is intended
here. Death with birth as its condition, death by violence, death by
natural causes, death from exhaustion of the life span, death from
exhaustion of merit, are names for it.



[47.]It has the characteristic of a fall. Its function is to
disjoin. It is manifested as absence from the destiny \[in which there
was the rebirth\]. It should be understood as suffering because it is a
basis for suffering.



Hence this is said:



Without distinction as they die\
Pain grips their minds impartially\
When wicked men their foul deeds see



[]



[]



Or sign of new rebirth, may be.\
Also when good men cannot bear\
To part from all that they hold dear.\
Then bodily pain severs sinews.\
Joints and so on, and continues \[



503\]



Torture unbearable, which racks\
All those whose vitals death attacks\
With grip that shall no more relax.\
Death is the basis of such pain.\
And this suffices to explain\
Why death the name of pain should gain.



This is the exposition of death.



\[(IV) SORROW\]



[48.]As regards *sorrow*, etc., sorrow is a burning in the mind
in one affected by loss of relatives, and so on. Although in meaning it
is the same as grief, nevertheless it has inner consuming as its
characteristic, its function is completely to consume the mind. It is
manifested as continual sorrowing. It is suffering because it is
intrinsic suffering and because it is a basis for suffering. Hence this
is said:



Sorrow is a poisoned dart\
That penetrates a being's heart;\
Setting up a burning there\
Like burning with a red-hot spear.



This state of mind brings future pain (see XVII.273f.)\
Such as disease, and then again\
Ageing and death, so one may tell\
Where for it is called pain as well.



This is the exposition of sorrow.



\[(V) LAMENTATION\]



[49.]*Lamentation* is verbal clamour on the part of one
affected by loss of relatives and so on. It has crying out as its
characteristic. Its function is proclaiming virtues and vices. It is
manifested as tumult. It is suffering because it is a state of suffering
due to formations and because it is a basis for suffering. Hence this is
said:



Now, when a man is struck by sorrows dart and he laments\
The pain he is already undergoing he augments\
With pain born of dry throat and lips and palate, hard to bear. And so
lamenting too is pain, the Buddha did declare.



This is the exposition of lamentation.



[]



[]



\[(VI) PAIN\]



[50.] *Pain * is bodily pain. Its characteristic is the
oppression of the body. Its function is to cause grief in the foolish*.*
It is manifested as bodily affliction. It is suffering because it is
intrinsic suffering, and because it brings mental suffering*.* Hence
this is said:



Pain distresses bodily.\
Thereby distressing mentally again;\
So acting fundamentally.\
It therefore is especially called pain.



This is the exposition of pain. \[



504\]



\[(VII) GRIEF\]



[51.]*Grief * is mental pain. Its characteristic is mental
oppression*. * Its function is to distress the mind*.* It is manifested
as mental affliction. It is suffering because it is intrinsic suffering,
and because it brings bodily suffering. For those who are gripped by
mental pain tear their hair, weep, thump their breasts, and twist and
writhe; they throw themselves upside*-*down,12 use the knife, swallow
poison, hang themselves with ropes, walk into fires, and undergo many
kinds of suffering. Hence this is said:



Though grief itself distresses mind.\
It makes distress of bodily kind occur.\
And that is why this mental grief\
Is pain, as those that have no grief aver.



This is the exposition of grief.



\[(VIII) DESPAIR\]



[52.] *Despair* is the same as the humour produced by excessive
mental suffering in one affected by loss of relatives, and so on. Some
say that it is one of the states included in the formations aggregate.
Its characteristic is burning of the mind. Its function is to bemoan. It
is manifested as dejection. It is suffering because it is suffering due
to formations, because of the burning of the mind, and because of bodily
dejection. Hence this is said:



So great the pain despair imparts\
It burns the heart as with fever's flame;\
The body's function it impairs\
And so despair borrows from pain its name.



This is the exposition of despair.



[53.]Sorrow is like the cooking \[of oil, etc.\]13 in a pot
over a slow fire. Lamentation is like its boiling over from the pot when
cooking over a quick fire. Despair is like



12\. Ee and Ae read *uddhapādaṃ* (or *uddhaṃ pādaṃ*) *papatanti,* but
Vibh-a (Be) reads *chinnapapātaṃ papatanti.* The former reading is
favoured by Vism-mhṭ.



13\. Vibh-a (Be) adds *telādīnaṃ;* not in Ee and Ae texts.



[]



[]



what remains in the pot after it has boiled over and is unable to do so
any more, going on cooking in the pot till it dries up.



\[(IX) ASSOCIATION WITH THE UNLOVED\]



[54.] *Association with the unloved* is meeting with
disagreeable beings and formations (inanimate things). Its
characteristic is association with the undesirable. Its function is to
distress the mind. It is manifested as a harmful state. It is suffering
because it is a basis for suffering. Hence this is said:



The mere sight of an unloved thing\
Brings firstly mental suffering.\
And suffering of body too\
Through touching it can then ensue.



And we therefore may recognize.\
Since meeting the unloved gives rise\
To either kind of pain, that\
He decided pain its name should be.



This is the exposition of association with the unloved. \[505\]



\[(X) SEPARATION FROM THE LOVED\]



[55.]*Separation from the loved* is to be parted from agreeable
beings and formations (inanimate things). Its characteristic is
dissociation from desirable objects. Its function is to arouse sorrow.
It is manifested as loss. It is suffering because it is a basis for the
suffering of sorrow. Hence this is said:



The dart of sorrow wounds the heart\
Of fools who from their wealth must part or kin.\
Which roughly should be grounds enough\
For counting the loved lost as suffering.



This is the exposition of separation from the loved.



\[(XI) NOT TO GET WHAT ONE WANTS\]



[56.]*Not to get what one wants*: the want itself of some
unobtainable object \[expressed\] in such passages as "Oh, that we were
not subject to birth!"* * (Vibh 101) is called suffering since one does
not get what is wanted. Its characteristic is the wanting of an
unobtainable object. Its function is to seek that. It is manifested as
disappointment. It is suffering because it is a basis for suffering.
Hence this is said:



When beings here expect to gain\
Something they build their hopes upon\
Which fails them, they are woebegone\
With disappointment's numbing pain.



Thereof the cause is hope they wed\
To something they cannot obtain:\
"Not to get what one wants is pain"\
The Conqueror has therefore said.



This is the exposition of not to get what one wants.



[]



[]



\[(XII) THE  FIVE AGGREGATES\]



[57.]In short *the five aggregates* \[as objects\] of clinging:



Now, birth and ageing and each thing\
Told in describing suffering,\
And those not mentioned, could not be\
Were there no aggregates for clinging.



Wherefore these aggregates for clinging\
Are taken in totality\
As pain by Him, the Dhamma's King,\
Who taught the end of suffering.



[58.]For birth, etc., thus oppress the pentad of aggregates
\[as objects\] of clinging as fire does fuel, as shooting does a target,
as gadflies, flies, etc., do a cow's body, as reapers do a field, as
village raiders do a Village; and they are generated in the aggregates
as weeds, creepers, etc., are on the ground, as flowers, fruits and
sprouts are on trees.



[59.] And the aggregates \[as objects\] of clinging have
*birth * as their initial suffering, *ageing* as their medial suffering,
and *death* as their final suffering. The suffering due to burning in
one who is the victim of the pain that threatens death is  *sorrow*. The
suffering consisting in crying out by one who is unable to bear that is
*lamentation.* Next, the suffering consisting in affliction of the body
due to the contact of undesirable tangible data, in other words,
disturbance of the elements, is *pain*. \[506\] The suffering oppressing
the mind through resistance to that in ordinary people oppressed by it,
is *grief*.* * The suffering consisting in brooding14 in those dejected
by the augmentation of sorrow, etc., is *despair. * The suffering
consisting in frustration of wants in those whose hopes are disappointed
is *not to get what one wants*. So when their various aspects are
examined, the aggregates \[as objects\] of clinging are themselves
suffering.



[60.] It is impossible to tell it \[all\] without remainder,
showing each kind of suffering, even \[by going on doing so\] for many
eons, so the Blessed One said, "In short the five aggregates \[as
objects\] of clinging are suffering" in order to show in short how all
that suffering is present in any of the five aggregates \[as objects\]
of clinging in the same way that the taste of the water in the whole
ocean is to be found in a single drop of its water.



This is the exposition of the aggregates \[as objects\] of clinging.
This, firstly, is



the method for the description of suffering.



\[THE TRUTH OF THE ORIGIN OF SUFFERING\]



[61.]But in the description of the *origin*, the expression
*yāyaṃ taṇhā* (that craving which) = *yā ayaṃ taṇhā*. \[As regards the
expression\] *produces further becoming*: it\
is a making become again, thus it is "becoming again" (*punabbhava*);
becoming again is its habit, thus it "produces further becoming"
(*ponobbhavika*). The expression *nandirāgasahagatā* (accompanied by
concern and greed) = *nandirāgena*



14\. *Anutthunana---*"brooding": not in PED = *anto nijjhāyana*
(Vism-mhṭ 532).



[]



[]



*sahagatā*; what is meant is that it is identical in meaning with
delight and greed. *Concerned with this and that*: wherever personality
is generated there is concern with that. The expression *that is to say*
(*seyyathidaṃ*) is a particle; its meaning is "which is that." *Craving
for sense desires*,  *craving for becoming*,  *craving for non*-
*becoming * will be explained in the Description of Dependent
Origination (XVII.233ff.). Although this is threefold, it should
nevertheless be understood as "the noble truth of the origin of
suffering," taking it as one in the sense of its generating the truth of
suffering*.*



\[THE TRUTH OF THE CESSATION OF SUFFERING\]



[62.]In the description of the *cessation* of suffering it is
the cessation of the origin that is stated by the words *that which is
... of that same craving*, and so on*.* Why is that? Because the
cessation of suffering comes about with the cessation of its origin*.*
For it is with the cessation of its origin that suffering ceases, not
otherwise*.* Hence it is said: \[507\]



"Just as a tree cut down grows up again\
While yet its root remains unharmed and sound,\
So with the tendency to crave intact\
This suffering is ever reproduced" (Dhp 338).



[63.] So it is because suffering ceases only through the
cessation of its origin that*,* when teaching the cessation of
suffering, the Blessed One therefore taught the cessation of the origin.
For the Perfect Ones behave like lions.15 When they make suffering cease
and when they teach the cessation of suffering, they deal with the
cause, not the fruit*. * But the sectarians behave like dogs. When they
make suffering cease and when they teach the cessation of suffering, by
teaching devotion to self*-*mortification, etc., they deal with the
fruit, not the cause. This, in the first place, is how the motive for
teaching the cessation of suffering by means of the cessation of its
origin should be understood.



[64.]This is the meaning*. Of that same craving:* of that
craving which, it was said, "produces further becoming," and which was
classed as "craving for sense desires" and so on. It is the path that is
called *fading away*; for "With the fading away \[of greed\] he is
liberated"* * (M I 139) is said. *Fading away and cessation* is
cessation through fading away. *Remainderless fading away and cessation*
is cessation through fading away that is remainderless because of
eradication of inherent tendencies. Or alternatively, it is abandoning
that is called *fading away*; and so the construction here can be
regarded as "remainderless fading away, remainderless cessation*.*"



[65.]But as to meaning, all of them are synonyms for Nibbāna*.*
For in the ultimate sense it is Nibbāna that is called "the noble truth
of the cessation of suffering."



15\. "Just as a lion directs his strength against the man who shot the
arrow at him, not against the arrow, so the Buddhas deal with the cause,
not with the fruit. But just as dogs, when struck with a clod, snarl and
bite the clod and do not attack the striker, so the sectarians who want
to make suffering cease devote themselves to mutilating the body, not to
causing cessation of defilements" (Vism-mhṭ 533).

But because craving fades away and ceases on coming to that,16 it is
therefore called "fading away" and "cessation." And because there comes
to be the giving up, etc., of that \[craving\] on coming to that
\[Nibbāna\], and since there is not even one kind of reliance here \[to
be depended upon\] from among the reliances consisting in the cords of
sense desires, etc., it is therefore called *giving it up*,
*relinquishing it, letting it go, not relying on it.*



[66.]It has peace as its characteristic. Its function is not to
die; or its function is to comfort*. * It is manifested as the signless;
or it is manifested as non- diversification.17



\[DISCUSSION ON NIBBĀNA\]



[67.] \[Question 1\] Is Nibbāna non-existent because it is
unapprehendable, like the hare's horn?



16\. "'*On coming to that* (*taṃ āgamma*)': on reaching that Nibbāna by
making it the object" (Vism-mhṭ 533). *Āgamma* (ger. of *āgacchati---*to
come) is commonly used as an adverb in the sense of "owing to" (e.g. at
M I 119). Here, however, it is taken literally by the Commentaries and
forms an essential part of the ontological proof of the positive
existence of Nibbāna. The *Sammohavinodanī* (commentary on the
Āyatana-Vibhaṅga Abhidhamma-bhājaniya) refutes the suggestion of a
disputant (*vitaṇḍavādin*) who asserts that Nibbāna is "mere
destruction" (*khayamatta*). The arguments used are merely supplementary
to those in §69 here, and so are not quoted. The conclusion of the
argument is worth noting, however, because of the emphasis on the words
"*taṃ āgamma*." It is this: "It is on coming to Nibbāna that greed,
etc., are destroyed. It is the same Nibbāna that is called 'destruction
of greed, destruction of hate, destruction of delusion.' These are just
three terms for Nibbāna---When this was said, he asked: You say 'On
coming to' (*āgamma*); from where have you got this 'on coming to'?---It
is got from the Suttas---Quote the sutta---'Thus ignorance and craving,
on coming to that, are destroyed in that, are abolished in that, nor
does anything anywhere ... (*evaṃ avijjā ca taṇhā ca taṃ āgamma tamhi
khīṇaṃ tamhi bhaggaṃ na ca kiñci kadāci* ... ).' When this was said, the
other was silent." The quotation has not been traced.



17\. *Nippapañca* (non-diversification) is one of the synonyms for
Nibbāna. The word *papañca* is commonly used in the Commentaries in the
sense (a) of an impediment or obstacle (Dhp-a I 18), and (b) as a delay,
or diffuseness (XVII.73). The sense in which the word is used in the
Suttas is that of diversifying and is best exemplified at M I 111:
"Friends, due to eye and to a visible object eye-consciousness arises.
The coincidence of the three is contact. With contact as condition there
is feeling. What a man feels that he perceives. What he perceives he
thinks about. What he thinks about he diversifies (*papañceti*). Owing
to his having diversified, the evaluation of diversifying perceptions
besets a man with respect to past, future, and present visible objects,"
and so on. This kind of *papañca* is explained by the Commentaries as
"due to craving, pride and views" (M-a I 25; II 10; II 75, etc.), and it
may be taken as the diversifying action, the choosing and rejecting, the
approval and disapproval (M I 65), exercised by craving, etc., on the
bare material supplied by perception and thought. Consequently, though
it is bound up with craving, etc., a false emphasis is given in
rendering *papañca* in these contexts by "obsession" as is done in PED.
*Nippapañca* as a term for Nibbāna emphasizes the absence of that.

\[Answer\] That is not so, because it is apprehendable by the \[right\]
means. For it is apprehendable \[by some, namely, the nobles ones\] by
the \[right\] means, in other words, by the way that is appropriate to
it, \[the way of virtue, concentration, and understanding\]; it is like
the supramundane consciousness of others, \[which is apprehendable only
by certain of the Noble Ones\] by means of knowledge of penetration of
others' minds. Therefore it should not be said that it is non-existent
because unapprehendable; for it should not be said that what the foolish
ordinary man does not apprehend is unapprehendable.



[68.]Again, it should not be said that Nibbāna does not exist.
Why not? Because it then follows that the way would be futile. \[508\]
For if Nibbāna were non- existent, then it would follow that the right
way, which includes the three aggregates beginning with virtue and is
headed by right understanding, would be futile. And it is not futile
because it does reach Nibbāna.



\[Q. 2\] But futility of the way does not follow because what is reached
is absence, \[that is, absence of the five aggregates consequent upon
the cutting off of the defilements\].



\[A.\] That is not so. Because, though there is absence of past and
future \[aggregates\], there is nevertheless no reaching of Nibbāna
\[simply because of that\].



\[Q. 3\] Then is the absence of present \[aggregates\] as well Nibbāna?



\[A.\] That is not so. Because their absence is an impossibility*,*
since if they are absent their non-presence follows. \[Besides*,* if
Nibbāna were absence of present aggregates too*,*\] that would entail
the fault of excluding the arising of the Nibbāna element with result of
past clinging left*,* at the path moment*,* which has present aggregates
as its support.



\[Q. 4\] Then will there be no fault if it is non-presence of
defilements \[that is



Nibbāna\]?



\[A.\] That is not so. Because it would then follow that the noble path
was meaningless. For if it were so*,* then, since defilements \[can be\]
non-existent also before the moment of the noble path*, * it follows
that the noble path would be meaningless. Consequently that is no
reason; \[it is unreasonable to say that Nibbāna is unapprehendable,
that it is non-existence, and so on\].



[69.] \[Q. 5\] But is not Nibbāna destruction, because of the
passage beginning, "That, friend, which is the destruction of greed ...
\[of hate ... of delusion ... is Nibbāna\]?" (S* * IV 251).



\[A.\] That is not so*,* because it would follow that Arahantship also
was mere destruction. For that too is described in the \[same\] way
beginning, "That*,* friend*,* which is the destruction of greed ... of
hate ... of delusion ... is Arahantship\]" (S IV 252).



And what is more*,* the fallacy then follows that Nibbāna would be
temporary*,* etc.; for if it were so*,* it would follow that Nibbāna
would be temporary, have the characteristic of being formed, and be
obtainable regardless of right effort; and precisely because of its
having formed characteristics it would be included in



[]



[]



the formed, and it would be burning with the fires of greed*,* etc.*,*
and because of its burning it would follow that it was suffering.



\[Q. 6\] Is there no fallacy if Nibbāna is that kind of destruction
subsequent to



which there is no more occurrence?



\[A.\] That is not so. Because there is no such kind of destruction. And
even if



there were, the aforesaid fallacies would not be avoided.



Also because it would follow that the noble path was Nibbāna. For the
noble path causes the destruction of defects, and that is why it is
called "destruction"; and subsequent to that there is no more occurrence
of the defects.



[70.] But it is because the kind of destruction called
"cessation consisting in non*-*arising," \[that is, Nibbāna,\] serves
figuratively speaking as decisive*-*support \[for the path\] that
\[Nibbāna\] is called "destruction" as a metaphor for it.



\[Q. 7\] Why is it not stated in its own form?



\[A.\] Because of its extreme subtlety. And its extreme subtlety is
established because it inclined the Blessed One to inaction, \[that is,
to not teaching the Dhamma (see M I 186)\] and because a Noble One's eye
is needed to see it (see M I 510).



[71.]It is not shared by all because it can only be reached by
one who is possessed of the path. And it is uncreated because it has no
first beginning*.*



\[Q*.* 8\] Since it is, when the path is, then it is not uncreated*.*



\[A.\] That is not so, because it is not arousable by the path; it is
only reachable, not arousable, by the path; that is why it is
uncreated*.* It is because it is uncreated that it is free from ageing
and death*.* It is because of the absence of its creation and of its
ageing and death that it is permanent. \[509\]



[72.]\[Q. 9\] Then it follows that Nibbāna, too, has the kind
of permanence \[claimed\] of the atom and so on.



\[A.\] That is not so. Because of the absence of any cause \[that brings
about its



arising\].



\[Q. 10\] Because Nibbāna has permanence, then, these \[that is, the
atom, etc.\]



are permanent as well.



\[A.\] That is not so. Because \[in that proposition\] the
characteristic of \[logical\]



cause does not arise. \[In other words, to say that Nibbāna is permanent
is not to assert a reason why the atom, etc., should be permanent\]



\[Q. 11\] Then they are permanent because of the absence of their
arising*, * as



Nibbāna is.



\[A.\] That is not so. Because the atom and so on have not been
established as facts.



[73.]The aforesaid logical reasoning proves that only this
\[that is, Nibbāna\] is permanent \[precisely because it is uncreated\];
and it is immaterial because it transcends the individual essence of
matter.



The Buddhas' goal is one and has no plurality. But this \[single goal*,*
Nibbāna*,*\] is firstly called *with result of past clinging left* since
it is made known together with the \[aggregates resulting from past\]
clinging still remaining \[during the Arahant's life\], being thus made
known in terms of the stilling of defilement



[]



[]



and the remaining \[result of past\] clinging that are present in one
who has reached it by means of development. But \[secondly, it is called
*without result of past clinging left*\] since after the last
consciousness of the Arahant, who has abandoned arousing \[future
aggregates\] and so prevented kamma from giving result in a future
\[existence\], there is no further arising of aggregates of existence,
and those already arisen have disappeared. So the \[result of past\]
clinging that remained is non-existent; and it is in terms of this
non-existence, in the sense that "there is no \[result of past\]
clinging here" that that \[same goal is called\] *without result of past
clinging left* (see It 38).



[74.] Because it can be arrived at by distinction of knowledge
that succeeds through untiring perseverance, and because it is the word
of the Omniscient One, Nibbāna is not non-existent as regards individual
essence in the ultimate sense; for this is said: "Bhikkhus, there is an
unborn, an unbecome, an unmade, an unformed" (It 37; Ud 80).18



18\. This discussion falls under three headings: Questions one to four
refute the assertion that Nibbāna is mythical and non-existent;
questions five to seven refute the assertion that Nibbāna is "mere
destruction;" (further argued in the *Sammohavinodanī---* Vibh-a 51f.)
the remaining questions deal with the proof that only Nibbāna (and not
the atom, etc.,) is permanent because uncreated.\
The *Paramatthamañjūsā* (Vism-mhṭ) covers the subject at great length
and reinforces the arguments given here with much syllogistic reasoning.
However, only the following paragraph will be quoted here, which is
reproduced in the commentaries to Ud 80 and It 37. (The last sentence
marked \*\* appears only in the Udāna Commentary. Readings vary
considerably):\
"Now, in the ultimate sense the existingness of the Nibbāna-element has
been demonstrated by the Fully Enlightened One, compassionate for the
whole world, by many sutta passages such as 'Dhammas without condition,'
'Unformed dhammas' (see Dhs 2), 'Bhikkhus, there is that base (sphere)
where neither earth ... ' (Ud 80), 'This state is very hard to see, that
is to say, the stilling of all formations, the relinquishing of all
substance of becoming' (D II 36; M I 167), 'Bhikkhus, I shall teach you
the unformed and the way leading to the unformed' (S IV 362), and so on,
and in this sutta, 'Bhikkhus, there is an unborn ..." (It 87; Ud 80). So
even if the wise trust completely in the Dispensation and have no
doubts, though they may not yet have had direct perception of it,
nevertheless there are persons who come to understand through another's
guidance (reading *paraneyya*-*buddhino*); and the intention here is
that this logical reasoning under the heading of deduction
(*niddhāraṇa*) should be for the purpose of removing their doubts.\
"Just as it is owing to full-understanding (reading *yathā
pariññeyyatāya*) that from the sense desires and from materiality, etc
(reading *rūpādīnaṃ*), that have something beyond them, there is made
known an escape \[from them\] that is their opposite and whose
individual essence is devoid of them, so there must exist an escape that
is the opposite of, and whose individual essence is devoid of, all
formed dhammas, all of which have the aforesaid individual essence
(reading *evaṃ taṃ*-*sabhāvānaṃ*), and it is this escape that is the
unformed element.\
"Besides, insight knowledge, which has formed dhammas as its object, and
also conformity knowledge, abandon the defilements with the abandoning
consisting in substitution of opposites, being unable to abandon them
with the abandoning



[]



[]



This is the section of the definition dealing with the description of
the cessation



of suffering.



\[THE TRUTH OF THE WAY\]



[75.]In the description of the *way leading to the cessation of
suffering* eight things are given. Though they have, of course, already
been explained as to meaning in the Description of the Aggregates, still
we shall deal with them here in order to remain aware of the difference
between them when they occur in a single moment \[on the occasion of the
path\].



[76.] Briefly (see XXII.31 for details), when a meditator is
progressing towards the penetration of the four truths, his eye of
understanding with Nibbāna as its object eliminates the inherent
tendency to ignorance, and that is *right view*. It has right seeing as
its characteristic. Its function is to reveal elements. It is manifested
as the abolition of the darkness of ignorance.



[77.] When he possesses such view, his directing of the mind on
to Nibbāna, which \[directing\] is associated with that \[right view\],
abolishes wrong thinking, and that is *right thinking.* Its
characteristic is right directing of the mind on to \[its object\]. Its
function is to bring about absorption \[of the path consciousness in
Nibbāna as object\]. It is manifested as the abandoning of wrong
thinking.



[78.] And when he sees and thinks thus, his abstinence from
wrong speech,



which abstinence is associated with that \[right view\], abolishes bad
verbal



consisting in cutting off. Likewise, the kind of knowledge that has
conventional truth (*sammuti*-*sacca*) \[that is, concepts\] as its
object, in the first jhāna, etc., abandons the defilements only with the
abandoning consisting in suppression, not by cutting them off. So,
because the kind of knowledge that has formed dhammas as its object and
that which has conventional truth as its object are both incapable of
abandoning defilements by cutting them off, there must \[consequently\]
exist an object for the noble-path- knowledge that effects their
abandonment by cutting them off, \[which object must be\] of a kind
opposite to both. And it is this that is the unformed element.
"Likewise, the words, 'Bhikkhus, there is an unborn, an unbecome, an
unmade, an unformed' and so on, which demonstrate the existingness of
Nibbāna in the ultimate sense, are not misleading because they are
spoken by the Blessed One, like the words, 'All formations are
impermanent, all formations are painful, all *dhammas* (states) are not
self' (Dhp 277--79; A I 286, etc.).\
"Likewise, in certain instances as regards scope, the word 'Nibbāna' has
the correct ultimate meaning for its scope \[precisely\] because of the
existence of its use as a mere metaphor---like the word 'lion' (see Ch.
XV, note 12, for the word lion). \*Or alternatively, the unformed
element exists in the ultimate sense also, because its individual
essence is the opposite of, is free from, that of the other kind \[of
element such as\] the earth element and feeling\*" (Vism-mhṭ 534--40).
The Pali of the last two paragraphs is taken to read thus:\
"*Tathā 'atthi bhikkhave ajātaṃ abhūtaṃ akataṃ asaṅkhatan' ti idaṃ
nibbāna-padassa* *paramatthato atthibhāva-jotakaṃ vacanaṃ aviparītatthaṃ
bhagavatā kathitattā; yaṃ hi bhagavatā bhāsitaṃ taṃ aviparitatthaṃ yathā
taṃ 'sabbe saṅkhārā aniccā sabbe saṅkhārā dukkhā sabbe dhammā anattā'
ti.*

conduct, \[510\] and that is called *right speech.* It has the
characteristic of embracing.19 Its function is to abstain. It is
manifested as the abandoning of wrong speech.



[79.] When he abstains thus, his abstinence from killing living
things, which abstinence is associated with that \[right view\], cuts
off wrong action, and that is called  *right action.* It has the
characteristic of originating.20 Its function is to abstain. It is
manifested as the abandoning of wrong action.



[80.]When his right speech and right action are purified, his
abstinence from wrong livelihood, which abstinence is associated with
that, \[right view\] cuts off scheming, etc., and that is called *right
livelihood.* It has the characteristic of cleansing.21 Its function is
to bring about the occurrence of a proper livelihood. It is manifested
as the abandoning of wrong livelihood.



[81.] When he is established on that plane of virtue called
right speech, right action, and right livelihood, his energy, which is
in conformity and associated with that \[right view\], cuts off
idleness, and that is called *right effort*. It has the characteristic
of exerting. Its function is the non-arousing of unprofitable things,
and so on. It is manifested as the abandoning of wrong effort.



[82.]When he exerts himself thus, the non-forgetfulness in his
mind, which is associated with that \[right view\], shakes off wrong
mindfulness, and that is called  *right mindfulness.* It has the
characteristic of establishing.22 Its function is not to forget. It is
manifested as the abandoning of wrong mindfulness.



[83.]When his mind is thus guarded by supreme mindfulness, the
unification of mind, which is associated with that \[right view\],
abolishes wrong concentration, and that is called *right concentration.*
It has the characteristic of



"Tathā nibbāna-saddo katthaci (pi) visaye yathābhūta-paramatthavisayo
upacāravuttimatta- *sabhāvato (pi) seyyathā pi sīha-saddo. \*Atha vā
atth'eva paramatthato asaṅkhata-dhātu itaraṃ
tabbiparītavimutta-sabhāvattā seyyathā pi pathavī-dhātu vedanā vā
ti.*"\* The discussion is summarized and additional arguments are added
in the *Abhidhammāvatāra*. The later *Abhidhammatthasaṅgaha* appears to
have shelved the problem. It may be noted that in the whole of this
discussion (particularly in the answer to Q. 4) no mention is made of
the abandoning of the inherent tendencies (*anusaya*) in the attainment
of Nibbāna (see, e.g., MN 64; S II 66). For derivations of the word
"Nibbāna" see VIII.247 and note 72.\



19\. "Right speech has as its individual essence the embracing of
associated states through affectionateness because it is the opposite of
false speech and the other kinds, which, being rough owing to their
respective functions of deceiving, etc., do not embrace" (Vism-mhṭ
541).\



20\. "Bodily work (*kāyika*-*kriyā*) originates (sets up) whatever has
to be done. And that originating (setting up) is itself a combining, so
the abstinence called right action is said to have originating as its
individual essence. Or it is the picking up of associated states which
is the causing of them to be originated, on the part of bodily work,
like the picking up of a burden" (Vism-mhṭ 541).\



21\. "The purification of a living being or of associated states is
'*cleansing*'"* * (Vism- mhṭ 541).\



22\. *Viniddhunana---*"shaking off": not in PED, (but see under
*dhunāti*); cf. II.11.

non*-*distraction. Its function is to concentrate. It is manifested as
the abandoning of wrong concentration.



This is the method in the description of the way leading to the
cessation of



suffering.



This is how the exposition should be understood here as to defining
birth



and so on.



\[GENERAL\]



[84.] *9.* *As to knowledge*'*s function* (see §14): the
exposition should be understood according to knowledge of the truths.
For knowledge of the truths is twofold, namely, knowledge as idea and
knowledge as penetration (cf. S V 431f; also XXII.92ff.). Herein,
knowledge as idea is mundane and occurs through hearsay, etc., about
cessation and the path. Knowledge consisting in penetration, which is
supramundane, penetrates the four truths as its function by making
cessation its object, according as it is said, "Bhikkhus, he who sees
suffering sees also the origin of suffering, sees also the cessation of
suffering, sees also the way leading to the cessation of suffering" (S V
437), and it should be repeated thus of all \[four truths\]*.* But its
function will be made clear in the purification by knowledge and vision
(XXII.92f.). \[511\]



[85.] When this knowledge is mundane, then, occurring as the
overcoming of obsessions, the knowledge of suffering therein forestalls
the \[false\] view of individuality; the knowledge of origin forestalls
the annihilation view; the knowledge of cessation forestalls the
eternity view; the knowledge of the path forestalls the
moral-inefficacy-of-action view. Or alternatively, the knowledge of
suffering forestalls wrong theories of fruit, in other words, \[seeing\]
lastingness, beauty, pleasure, and self in the aggregates, which are
devoid of lastingness, beauty, pleasure, and self; and knowledge of
origin forestalls wrong theories of cause that occur as finding a reason
where there is none, such as "The world occurs owing to an Overlord, a
Basic Principle*, * Time*, * Nature (Individual Essence)," etc.;23 the
knowledge of cessation forestalls such wrong theories of



23\. "Those who hold that there is an Overlord (Omnipotent Being) as
reason say, 'An Overlord (*issara*) makes the world occur, prepares it,
halts, it, disposes of it.' Those who hold that there is a Basic
Principle as reason say, 'The world is manifested from out of a Basic
Principle (*padhāna*), and it is reabsorbed in that again.' Those who
hold the theory of Time say:\
Time it is that creates beings,\
Disposes of this generation;\
Time watches over those who sleep;\
To outstrip Time is hard indeed.\
Those who hold the theory of Nature (*sabhāva*---individual essence)
say, 'The world appears and disappears (*sambhoti vibhoti ca*) just
because of its nature (individual essence), like the sharp nature
(essence) of thorns, like the roundness of wood-apples (*kabiṭṭha* =
*Feronia elephantum*), like the variedness of wild beasts, birds,
snakes, and so\
on.' The word, 'etc.' refers to those who preach fatalism and say, 'The
occurrence of the world is due to atoms. All is due to causes effected
in the past. The world is



[]



[]



cessation as taking final release to be in the immaterial world*,* in a
World Apex (Shrine), etc.; and the path knowledge forestalls wrong
theories of means that occur by taking to be the way of purification
what is not the way of purification and consists in devotion to
indulgence in the pleasures of sense desire and in self-mortification.
Hence this is said:



As long as a man is vague about the world.\
About its origin, about its ceasing.\
About the means that lead to its cessation.\
So long he cannot recognize the truths.



This is how the exposition should be understood here as to knowledge's



function.



[86.]*10. As to division of content:* all states excepting
craving and states free from cankers are included in the *truth of
suffering.* The thirty-six modes of behaviour of craving24 are included
in the *truth of origin.* The *truth of cessation* is unmixed. As
regards the *truth of the path*: the heading of *right view* includes
the fourth road to power consisting in inquiry, the understanding
faculty, the understanding power, and the investigation-of-states
enlightenment factor. The term *right thinking* includes the three kinds
of applied thought beginning with that of renunciation (D III 215). The
term *right speech* includes the four kinds of good verbal conduct (A II
131). The term *right action* includes the three kinds of good bodily
conduct (cf. M I 287). The heading *right livelihood* includes fewness
of wishes and contentment. Or all these \[three\] constitute the virtue
loved by Noble Ones, and the virtue loved by Noble Ones has to be
embraced by the hand of faith;



determined, like drilled gems threaded on an unbroken string. There is
no doing by a man'; and to those who preach chance: It is by chance that
they occur, By chance as well that they do not;\
Pleasure and pain are due to chance,\
This generation \[lives\] by chance;\
and to those who preach liberation by chance.\
*"'Taking final release to be in the immaterial world"* like that of
Rāmudaka, Āḷāra (see MN 26), etc., or '*in a World Apex* (*World
Shrine---lokathūpika*)' like that of the Nigaṇṭhas (Jains). And by the
word, 'etc.' are included also the preachers of 'Nibbāna here and now'
as the self's establishment in its own self when it has become
dissociated from the qualities (guṇa) owing to the non-occurrence of the
Basic Principle (*padhāna*, Skr. *pradhāna*---see the Sāṃkhya system),
and being in the same world as, in the presence of, or in union with,
Brahmā" (Vism-mhṭ 543).\



24\. "The '*thirty-six modes of behaviour of craving*' are the three,
craving for sense desires, for becoming, and for non*-*becoming, in the
cases of each one of the twelve internal- external bases; or they are
those given in the Khuddakavatthu-Vibhaṅga (Vibh 391 and 396), leaving
out the three periods of time, for with those they come to one hundred
and eight" (Vism-mhṭ 544). "'*Thoughts of renunciation, etc.*': in the
mundane moment they are the three separately, that is, non*-*greed,
loving kindness, and compassion; they are given as one at the path
moment, owing to the cutting off of greed, ill will and cruelty"
(Vism-mhṭ 544).\
"'Consciousness concentration (*citta-samādhi*)' is the road to power
consisting of \[purity of\] consciousness, they say" (Vism-mhṭ 544).



[]



[]



consequently the faith faculty, the faith power, and the road to power
consisting in zeal are included because of the presence of these
\[three\]. The term *right effort* includes fourfold right endeavour,
the energy faculty, energy power, and energy enlightenment factor. The
term *right mindfulness* includes the fourfold foundation of
mindfulness, the mindfulness faculty, the mindfulness power, and the
mindfulness enlightenment factor. The term *right concentration*
includes the three kinds of concentration beginning with that
accompanied by applied and sustained thought (D III 219), consciousness
concentration, the concentration faculty, \[512\] the concentration
power, and the enlightenment factors of happiness, tranquillity,
concentration, and equanimity.



This is how the exposition should be understood as to division of
content.



[87.] *As to simile*: The truth of suffering
should be regarded as a burden, the truth of origin as the taking up of
the burden, the truth of cessation as the putting down of the burden,
the truth of the path as the means to putting down the burden (see S III
26), The truth of suffering is like a disease, the truth of origin is
like the cause of the disease, the truth of cessation is like the cure
of the disease, and the truth of the path is like the medicine. Or the
truth of suffering is like a famine, the truth of origin is like a
drought, the truth of cessation is like plenty, and the truth of the
path is like timely rain.



Furthermore, these truths can be understood in this way by applying
these similes: enmity, the cause of the enmity, the removal of the
enmity, and the means to remove the enmity; a poison tree, the tree's
root, the cutting of the root, and the means to cut the root; fear, the
cause of fear, freedom from fear*,* and the means to attain it; the
hither shore*,* the great flood*,* the further shore*,* and the effort
to reach it.



This is how the exposition should be understood as to simile.



[88.] *As to tetrad:* (a) there is suffering that
is not noble truth*,* (b) there is noble truth that is not suffering*,*
(c) there is what is both suffering and noble truth*,* and (d) there is
what is neither suffering nor noble truth. So also with origin and the
rest.



[89.]Herein*,* (a) though states associated with the path and
the fruits of asceticism are suffering since they are suffering due to
formations (see §35) because of the words, "What is impermanent is
painful" (S II 53; III 22), still they are not the noble truth \[of
suffering\], (b) Cessation is a noble truth but it is not suffering, (c)
The other two noble truths can be suffering because they are
impermanent*,* but they are not so in the real sense of that for the
full-understanding of which (see §28) the life of purity is lived under
the Blessed One. The five aggregates \[as objects\] of clinging, except
craving, are in all aspects both suffering and noble truth. \[513\] (d)
The states associated with the path and the fruits of asceticism are
neither suffering in the real sense of that for the full-understanding
of which the life of purity is lived under the Blessed One, nor are they
noble truth. Origin, etc., should also be construed in the corresponding
way. This is how the exposition should be understood here as to tetrad.



[90.] *As to void, singlefold, and so on:*
firstly, *as to void*: in the ultimate sense all the truths should be
understood as void because of the absence of (i) any experiencer, (ii)
any doer, (iii) anyone who is extinguished, and (iv) any goer. Hence
this is said:



[]



[]



For there is suffering, but none who suffers;\
Doing exists although there is no door.\
Extinction is but no extinguished person;\
Although there is a path, there is no goer.



Or alternatively:



So void of lastingness, and beauty, pleasure, self,\
Is the first pair, and void of self the deathless state,\
And void of lastingness, of pleasure and of self\
Is the path too; for such is voidness in these four.



[91.]Or three are void of cessation, and cessation is void of
the other three. Or the cause is void of the result, because of the
absence of suffering in the origin, and of cessation in the path; the
cause is not gravid with its fruit like the Primordial Essence of those
who assert the existence of Primordial Essence. And the result is void
of the cause owing to the absence of inherence of the origin in
suffering and of the path in cessation; the fruit of a cause does not
have its cause inherent in it, like the two atoms, etc., of those who
assert inherence. Hence this is said:



Here three are of cessation void;\
Cessation void, too, of these three;\
The cause of its effect is void,\
Void also of its cause the effect must be.



This, in the first place, is how the exposition should be understood as
to



void.25 \[514\]



[92.] *As to singlefold and so on*: and here all
*suffering* is of one kind as the state of occurrence. It is of two
kinds as mentality-materiality. It is of three kinds as



25\. It may be noted in passing that the word *anattā* (not-self) is
never applied directly to Nibbāna in the Suttas (and Abhidhamma), or in
Bhante Buddhaghosa's commentaries (Cf. Ch. XXI, note 4, where Vism-mhṭ
is quoted explaining the scope of applicability of the "three
characteristics"). The argument introduced here that, since *attā *
(self) is a non*-* existent myth, therefore Nibbāna (the unformed
dhamma, the truth of cessation) is *void of self* (*atta-suñña*) is
taken up in the *Saddhammappakāsinī* (Hewavitarne Ce, p. 464): All
dhammas whether grouped together\
In three ways, two ways, or one way,\
Are void: thus here in this dispensation\
Do those who know voidness make their comment.\
"How so? Firstly, all mundane dhammas are void of lastingness, beauty,
pleasure, and self because they are destitute of lastingness, beauty,
pleasure, and self. Path and fruition dhammas are void of lastingness,
pleasure, and self, because they are destitute of lastingness, pleasure,
and self. Nibbāna dhammas (pl.) are void of self because of the
non-existence (*abhāva*) of self. \[Secondly,\] formed dhammas, both
mundane and supramundane, are all void of a \[permanent\] living being
(*satta*) because of the non- existence of \[such\] a living being of
any sort whatever. The unformed dhamma (sing.) is void of formations
because of the non-existence (*abhāva: * or absence) of those formations
too. \[Thirdly,\] all dhammas formed and unformed are void of self
because of the non-existence of any person (*puggala*) called 'self'
(*attā*)."

divided into rebirth-process becoming in the sense sphere, fine-material
sphere, and immaterial sphere. It is of four kinds classed according to
the four nutriments. It is of five kinds classed according to the five
aggregates \[as objects\] of clinging.



[93.]Also *origin* is of one kind as making occur. It is of two
kinds as associated and not associated with \[false\] view. It is of
three kinds as craving for sense desires, craving for becoming, and
craving for non-becoming. It is of four kinds as abandonable by the four
paths. It is of five kinds classed as delight in materiality, and so on.
It is of six kinds classed as the six groups of craving.



[94.]Also *cessation* is of one kind being the unformed
element. But indirectly it is of two kinds as "with result of past
clinging left" and as "without result of past clinging left";26 and of
three kinds as the stilling of the three kinds of becoming; and of four
kinds as approachable by the four paths; and of five kinds as the
subsiding of the five kinds of delight; and of six kinds classed
according to the destruction of the six groups of craving.



[95.]Also the *path* is of one kind as what should be
developed. It is of two kinds classed according to serenity and insight,
or classed according to seeing and developing. It is of three kinds
classed according to the three aggregates; for the \[path\], being
selective, is included by the three aggregates, which are comprehensive,
as a city is by a kingdom, according as it is said: "The three
aggregates are not included in the Noble Eightfold Path, friend Visākha,
but the Noble Eightfold Path is included by the three aggregates. Any
right speech, any right action, any right livelihood: these are included
in the virtue aggregate. Any right effort, any right mindfulness, any
right concentration: these are included in the concentration aggregate.
Any right view, any right thinking: these are included in the
understanding aggregate" (M I 301).



[96.]For here the three beginning with right speech are virtue
and so they are included in the virtue aggregate, being of the same
kind. For although in the text the description is given in the locative
case as "in the virtue aggregate," still the meaning should be
understood according to the instrumental case \[that is, "by the virtue
aggregate."\]



As to the three beginning with right effort, concentration cannot of its
own nature cause absorption through unification on the object; but with
energy accomplishing its function of exerting and mindfulness
accomplishing its function of preventing wobbling, it can do so.



[97.]Here is a simile: three friends, \[thinking,\] "We will
celebrate the festival," entered a park. Then one saw a champak tree in
full blossom, but he could not reach the flowers by raising his hand.
The second bent down for the first to climb



26\. "It is clung-to (*upādiyati*) by the kinds of clinging (*upādāna*),
thus it is 'result-of- past-clinging' (*upādi*): this is the pentad of
aggregates \[as objects\] of clinging. Taking Nibbāna, which is the
escape from that, as its stilling, its quieting, since there is
remainder of it up till the last consciousness \[of the Arahant\], after
which there is no remainder of it, the Nibbāna element is thus
conventionally spoken of in two ways as 'with result of past clinging
left' (*sa-upādi*-*sesa*) and 'without result of past clinging left'
(*an*-*upādi*-*sesa*)" (Vism-mhṭ 547).

on his back. But although standing on the other's back, he still could
not pick them because of his unsteadiness. \[515\] Then the third
offered his shoulder \[as support\]. So standing on the back of the one
and supporting himself on the other's shoulder, he picked as many
flowers as he wanted and after adorning himself, he went and enjoyed the
festival. And so it is with this.



[98.] For the three states beginning with right effort, which
are born together, are like the three friends who enter the park
together. The object is like the champak tree in full blossom.
Concentration, which cannot of its own nature bring about absorption by
unification on the object, is like the man who could not pick the flower
by raising his arm. Effort is like the companion who bent down, giving
his back to mount upon. Mindfulness is like the friend who stood by,
giving his shoulder for support. Just as standing on the back of the one
and supporting himself on the other's shoulder he could pick as many
flowers as he wanted, so too, when energy accomplishes its function of
exerting and when mindfulness accomplishes its function of preventing
wobbling, with the help so obtained concentration can bring about
absorption by unification on the object. So here in the concentration
aggregate it is only concentration that is included as of the same kind.
But effort and mindfulness are included because of their action \[in
assisting\].



[99.] Also as regards right view and right thinking,
understanding cannot of its own nature define an object as impermanent,
painful, not*-*self. But with applied thought giving \[assistance\] by
repeatedly hitting \[the object\] it can.



[100.] How? Just as a money changer, having a coin placed in
his hand and being desirous of looking at it on all sides equally,
cannot turn it over with the power of his eye only, but by turning it
over with his fingers he is able to look at it on all sides, similarly
understanding cannot of its own nature define an object as impermanent
and so on. But \[assisted\] by applied thought with its characteristic
of directing the mind on to \[the object\] and its function of striking
and threshing, as it were, hitting and turning over, it can take
anything given and define it. So here in the understanding aggregate it
is only right view that is included as of the same kind. But right
thinking is included because of its action \[in assisting\].



[101.] So the path is included by the three aggregates. Hence
it was said that it is of three kinds classed according to the three
aggregates. And it is of four kinds as the path of stream-entry and so
on.



[102.] In addition, all the truths are of one kind because they
are not unreal, or because they must be directly known. They are of two
kinds as (i and ii) mundane and (iii and iv) supramundane, or (i, ii,
and iv) formed and (iii) unformed. They are of three kind as (ii) to be
abandoned by seeing and development, (iii and iv) not to be abandoned,
and (i) neither to be abandoned nor not to be abandoned. They are of
four kinds classed according to what has to be fully understood, and so
on (see §28).



This is how the exposition should be understood as to singlefold and so
on.



\[516\]



[]



[]



[103.] *15.*  *As to similar and dissimilar,* all the truths
are similar to each other because they are not unreal, are void of self,
and are difficult to penetrate, according as it is said: "What do you
think, Ānanda, which is more difficult to do, more difficult to perform,
that a man should shoot an arrow through a small keyhole from a distance
time after time without missing or that he should penetrate the tip of a
hair split a hundred times with the tip \[of a similar hair\]?"--- "This
is more difficult to do, venerable sir, more difficult to perform, that
a man should penetrate the tip of a hair split a hundred times with the
tip \[of a similar hair\]."---"They penetrate something more difficult
to penetrate than that, Ānanda, who penetrate correctly thus, 'This is
suffering' ... who penetrate correctly thus, 'This is the way leading to
the cessation of suffering'" (S V 454). They are dissimilar when defined
according to their individual characteristics.



[104.] And the first two are similar since they are profound
because hard to grasp, since they are mundane, and since they are
subject to cankers. They are dissimilar in being divided into fruit and
cause, and being respectively to be fully understood and to be
abandoned. And the last two are similar since they are hard to grasp
because profound, since they are supramundane, and since they are free
from cankers. They are dissimilar in being divided into object and what
has an object, and in being respectively to be realized and to be
developed. And the first and third are similar since they come under the
heading of result. They are dissimilar in being formed and unformed.
Also the second and fourth are similar since they come under the heading
of cause. They are dissimilar in being respectively entirely
unprofitable and entirely profitable. And the first and fourth are
similar in being formed. They are dissimilar in being mundane and
supramundane. Also the second and the third are similar since they are
the state of neither*-*trainer*-*nor*-*non*-*trainer (see Vibh 114).
They are dissimilar in being respectively with object and without
object.



A man of vision can apply\
By suchlike means his talent so\
That he among the truths may know\
The similar and contrary.

## CHAPTER XVII 


THE SOIL OF UNDERSTANDING---CONCLUSION:



DEPENDENT ORIGINATION



(*Paññā-bhūmi-niddesa*)



\[SECTION A. DEFINITION OF DEPENDENT ORIGINATION\]



[1.]\[517\] The turn has now come for the exposition of the
dependent origination itself, and the dependently-originated states
comprised by the word "etc.," since these still remain out of the states
called the "soil" (*bhūmi*), of which it was said above, "The states
classed as aggregates, bases, elements, faculties, truths, and dependent
origination, etc., are the 'soil'" (XIV.32).



[2.] Herein, firstly, it is the states beginning with ignorance
that should be understood as *dependent origination*. For this is said
by the Blessed One: "And what is the dependent origination, bhikkhus?
With ignorance as condition there are \[volitional\] formations; with
formations as condition, consciousness; with consciousness as condition,
mentality-materiality; with mentality- materiality as condition, the
sixfold base; with the sixfold base as condition, contact; with contact
as condition, feeling; with feeling as condition, craving; with craving
as condition, clinging; with clinging as condition, becoming; with
becoming as condition, birth; with birth as condition there is
ageing-and- death, and sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair;
thus there is the arising of this whole mass of suffering. This is
called the dependent origination, bhikkhus" (S II 1).



[3.] Secondly, it is the states beginning with ageing-and-death
that should be understood as *dependently-originated states*. For this
is said by the Blessed One: "And what are the dependently-originated
states, bhikkhus? Ageing-and-death is impermanent, bhikkhus, formed,
dependently originated, subject to destruction, subject to fall, subject
to fading away, subject to cessation.1 Birth is impermanent, bhikkhus,
... Becoming ... Clinging ... Craving ... Feeling ... Contact ... The
sixfold base ... Mentality-materiality ... Consciousness ... Formations
... Ignorance is impermanent, bhikkhus, formed, dependently originated,
subject to destruction, subject to fall, subject to fading away, subject



1\. "'Subject to destruction' (*khaya*-*dhamma*) means that its
individual essence is the state of being destroyed
(*khayana-sabhāva*)"* * (Vism-mhṭ 549). The other expressions are
explained in the same way.


[]



[]



to cessation. These are called the dependently-originated states,
bhikkhus" (S II 26). \[518\]



[4.] Here is a brief explanation. The states that are
conditions should be understood as the *dependent origination*. The
states generated by such and such conditions are *dependently-originated
states*.



[5.]How is that to be known? By the Blessed One's word. For it
is precisely those states which are conditions, that with the synonyms
beginning with "reality" have been called "dependent origination" by the
Blessed One when teaching the dependent origination in the sutta on the
Teaching of the Dependent Origination and Dependently-originated States
thus:



"And what is dependent origination, bhikkhus?



"With birth as condition, bhikkhus, there is ageing and death. Whether
Perfect Ones arise or do not arise, there yet remains that element,
relatedness of states, regularity of states, specific conditionally. The
Perfect One discovers it, penetrates to it. Having discovered it,
penetrated to it, he announces it, teaches it, makes it known,
establishes, exposes, expounds, and explains it: 'See,' he says, 'With
birth as condition there is ageing and death.'



"With becoming as condition, bhikkhus, there is birth ... With ignorance
as condition, bhikkhus, there are formations. Whether Perfect Ones arise
or do not arise, there yet remains that element, relatedness of states,
regularity of states, specific conditionally. The Perfect One discovers
it, penetrates to it. Having discovered it, penetrated to it, he
announces it, teaches it, makes it known, establishes, exposes, expounds
and explains it: 'See,' he says, 'With ignorance as condition there are
formations.'



"So, bhikkhus, that herein which is reality, not unreality, not
otherness, specific



conditionality: that is called dependent origination" (S II 25f.).



Consequently, it should be understood that dependent origination has the
characteristic of being the conditions for the states beginning with
ageing-and- death. Its function is to continue \[the process of\]
suffering. It is manifested as the wrong path.



[6.] Because particular states are produced by particular
conditions, neither less nor more, it is called *reality* (suchness).
Because once the conditions have met in combination there is no
non-producing, even for an instant, of the states they generate, it is
called not *unreality* (not unsuchness). Because there is no arising of
one state with another state's conditions, it is called *not otherness*.
Because there is a condition, or because there is a total of conditions,
for these states beginning with ageing-and-death as already stated, it
is called *specific conditionality*.



[7.]Here is the word meaning: *idappaccayā* (lit.
that-conditions) = *imesaṃ paccayā* (conditions for those);
*idappaccayā* (that-conditions) = *idappaccayatā* (that-\
conditionality, conditionality for those, specific conditionality). Or
alternatively, *idappaccayatā* (that-conditionality) = *idappaccayānaṃ
samūho* (the total of that-\
conditions, total specific conditionality).



[]



[]



[8.] The characteristic must be sought from grammar. Some, in
fact, \[say that the expression *paṭicca samuppāda* (dependent
origination) is characterized thus:\] "having depended (*paṭicca*), a
right (*sammā*) arising (*uppāda*), \[depending on causes rightly by\]
disregarding such causes conjectured by sectarians as the Primordial
Essence (*Prakºti*), World Soul (*Puruåa*), and so on." So what they
call dependent origination (*paṭicca samuppāda*) is a simple arising
(*uppāda*) \[for they equate the prefix *saṃ* only with *sammā*
(rightly) and ignore  *saṃ* (with, con-)\]. That is untenable. \[519\]
Why? (1) There is no such sutta; (2) it contradicts suttas; (3) it
admits of no profound treatment; and (4) it is ungrammatical.



[9.](1) No sutta describes the dependent origination as simple
arising.



\(2\) Anyone who asserts that dependent origination is of that kind
involves himself in conflict with the Padesavihāra Sutta. How? The Newly
Enlightened One's abiding (*vihāra*) is the bringing of the dependent
origination to mind, because, of these words of the Blessed One's: "Then
in the first watch of the night the Blessed One brought to mind the
dependent origination in direct and reverse order" \[as origination and
cessation\] (Vin I 1; Ud 2). Now, "*padesavihāra*" is the abiding
(*vihāra*) in one part (*desa*) of that, according as it is said,
"Bhikkhus, I abode in a part of the abiding in which I abode when I was
newly enlightened" (S V 12; Paṭis I 107). And there he abode in the
vision of structure of conditions, not in the vision of simple arising,
according as it is said, "So I understood feeling with wrong view as its
condition, and feeling with right view as its condition, and feeling
with wrong thinking as its condition ..." (S V 12), all of which should
be quoted in full. So anyone who asserts that dependent origination is
simple arising involves himself in conflict with the Padesavihāra Sutta.



[10.] There is likewise contradiction of the Kaccāna Sutta. For
in the Kaccāna Sutta it is said, "When a man sees correctly with right
understanding the origination of the world, Kaccāna, he does not say of
the world that it is not" (S II 17). And there it is the dependent
origination in forward order, not simple arising, that, as the
origination of the world from its conditions, is set forth in order to
eliminate the annihilation view. For the annihilation view is not
eliminated by seeing simple arising; but it is eliminated by seeing the
chain of conditions as a chain of fruits following on a chain of
conditions. So anyone who asserts that the dependent origination is
simple arising involves himself in contradiction of the Kaccāna Sutta.



[11.](3) *It admits of no profound treatment*: this has been
said by the Blessed One, "This dependent origination is profound,
Ānanda, and profound it appears" (D II 55; S II 92). And the profundity
is fourfold as we shall explain below (XVII.304f.); but there is none of
that in simple arising. And this dependent origination is explained \[by
the teachers\] as adorned with the fourfold method (XVII.309); but there
is no \[need of\] any such tetrad of methods in simple arising. So
dependent origination is not simple arising, since that admits of no
profound treatment.



[12.](4) *It is ungrammatical*: \[520\] this word *paṭicca*
(lit. "having depended"; freely "due to," "dependent"), \[being a gerund
of the verb *paṭi* + *eti*, to go back to\],



[]



[]



establishes a meaning \[in a formula of establishment by verb\] when it
is construed as past with the same subject \[as that of the principal
verb\], as in the sentence "Having depended on (*paṭicca* = 'due to')
the eye and visible objects, eye-\
consciousness arises (*uppajjati*)" (S II 72). But if it is construed
here with the word *uppāda* (arising), \[which is a noun\], in a formula
of establishment by noun, there is a breach of grammar, because there is
no shared subject \[as there is in above-quoted sentence\], and so it
does not establish any meaning al all. So the dependent origination is
not simple arising because that is ungrammatical.



[13.] Here it might be \[argued\]: "We shall add the words
'comes to be' (*hoti*) thus: 'Having depended, arising comes to be'
(*paṭicca, samuppādo*  *hoti*)." That will not do. Why not? Because
there is no instance in which it has been added, and because the fallacy
of the arising of an arising follows. For in such passages as
"*Paṭiccasamuppādaṃ vo bhikkhave desessāmi. Katamo ca bhikkhave
paṭiccasamuppādo* ...  *Ayaṃ vuccati bhikkhave paṭiccasamuppādo* (I
shall teach you the dependent origination, bhikkhus. And what is the
dependent origination? ... This is called the dependent origination,
bhikkhus)" (S II 1), the words "comes to be" (*hoti*) are not added in
any single instance. And there is no \[such expression as\] "arising
comes to be": if there were, it would be tantamount to saying that
arising itself had an arising too.



[14.] And those are wrong who imagine that specific
conditionality (*idappaccayatā*) is the specific conditions'
\[abstract\] essence---what is called "abstract essence" being a
\[particular\] mode in ignorance, etc., that acts as cause in the
manifestation of formations, etc.---and that the term "dependent
origination" is used for an alteration in formations when there is that
\[particular mode in the way of occurrence of ignorance\]. Why are they
wrong? Because it is ignorance, etc., themselves that are called causes.
For in the following passage it is ignorance, etc., themselves, not
their alteration, that are called the causes \[of these states\]:
"Therefore, Ānanda, just this is the cause, this is the source, this is
the origin, this is the condition, for ageing-and-death, that is to say,
birth ... for formations, that is to say, (ignorance)" (D II
57--63---the last clause is not in the Dīgha text). Therefore it is the
actual states themselves as conditions that should be understood as
"dependent origination." So what was said above (§4) can be understood
as rightly said.



[15.] If any notion arises in the guise of a literal
interpretation of the term "dependent origination" (*paṭicca-samuppāda*)
to the effect that it is only arising that is stated, it should be got
rid of by apprehending the meaning of this expression in the following
way. For:



In double form this term relates to a totality of state\
Produced from a conditionality;\
Hence the conditions for that sum\
Through metaphor's device have come\
To bear their fruits' name figuratively\
In the Blessed One's exposition.



[16.] This term "dependent origination," when applied to the
total of states



produced from the \[total\] conditionality, must be taken in two ways.
\[521\] For



[]



[]



that \[total\] ought to be arrived at (*paṭicco---*adj.),2 since when it
is arrived at (*paṭiyamāno*), it leads to \[supramundane\] welfare and
bliss and so the wise \[regard\] it as worthy to be arrived at
(*paccetuṃ*); and then, when it arises (*uppajjamāno*), it does so
"together with" (*saha*) and "rightly" (*sammā*), not singly or
causelessly, thus it is a co-arising (*samuppādo*). Consequently: it is
to be arrived at (*paṭicco*) and it is a co-arising (*samuppādo*), thus
it is dependent origination (*paṭicca-samuppāda*). Again: it arises as a
togetherness (*saha*), thus it is a co- arising (*samuppāda*); but it
does so having depended (*paṭicca---*ger.) in combination with
conditions, not regardless of them. Consequently: it, having depended
(*paṭicca*), is a co-arising (*samuppāda*), thus in this way also it is
dependent origination (*paṭicca-samuppāda*). And the total of causes is
a condition for that \[total of states produced from the
conditionality\], so, because it is a condition for that, this \[total
of causes\] is called, "dependent origination," using for it the term
ordinarily used for its fruit just as in the world molasses, which is a
condition for phlegm, is spoken of thus, "Molasses is phlegm," or just
as in the Dispensation the arising of Buddhas, which is a condition for
bliss, is spoken of thus, "The arising of Buddhas is bliss" (Dhp 194).



[17.] Or alternatively:



The sum of causes too they call\
"Facing its counterpart," so all\
Is in that sense "dependent," as they tell;\
This sum of causes too, as stated,\
Gives fruits that rise associated,\
So "co-arising" it is called as well.



[18.]This total of causes---indicated severally under the
heading of each cause, beginning with ignorance---for the manifestation
of formations, etc., is called "dependent" (*paṭicco---*adj.), taking it
as "facing, gone to, its counterpart" (*paṭimukham ito*) owing to the
mutual interdependence of the factors in the combination, in the sense
both that they produce common fruit and that none can be dispensed with.
And it is called a "co-arising" (*samuppādo*) since it causes the states
that occur in unresolved mutual interdependence to arise associatedly.
Consequently: it is dependent (*paṭicco*) and a co-arising
(*samuppādo*), thus in this way also it is dependent origination
(*paṭicca-samuppāda*).



[19.] Another method:



This total conditionally, acting interdependently,\
Arouses states together equally;\
So this too is a reason here wherefore the Greatest Sage,



the Seer,



Gave to this term its form thus succinctly.



2\. *Paṭicco* as a declinable adjective is not in PED. *Patīyamāna*
("when it is arrived at"): "When it is gone to by direct confrontation
(*paṭimukhaṃ upeyamāno*) by means of knowledge's going; when it is
penetrated to (*abhisamiyamāna*), is the meaning" (Vism- mhṭ 555). The
word *paṭicca* (due to, depending on) and the word *paccaya* (condition)
are both gerunds of *paṭi + eti* or *ayati* (to go back to).



[]



[]



[20.]Among the conditions described under the headings of
ignorance, etc., the respective conditions that make the
\[conditionally-arisen\] states beginning with formations arise are
incapable of making them arise when not mutually dependent and when
deficient. Therefore this conditionality by depending (*paṭicca---*ger.)
makes states arise (*uppādeti*) equally and together (*samaṃ saha ca*),
not piecemeal and successively---so it has been termed here thus by the
Sage who is skilled in phraseology that conforms to its meaning: it has
been accurately termed "dependent origination" (*paṭicca samuppāda*), is
the meaning.



[21.]And while so termed:



The first component will deny the false view of eternity\
And so on, and the second will prevent\
The nihilistic type of view and others like it, while the two Together
show the true way that is meant.



*The first*: the word "dependent" (*paṭicca*) indicates the combination
of the conditions, \[522\] since states in the process of occurring
exist in dependence on the combining of their conditions; and it shows
that they are not eternal, etc., thus denying the various doctrines of
eternalism, no-cause, fictitious-cause, and power-wielder.3 What purpose
indeed would the combining of conditions serve, if things were eternal,
or if they occurred without cause, and so on?



[23.]*The second*: the word "origination" (*samuppāda*)
indicates the arising of the states, since these occur when their
conditions combine, and it shows how to prevent annihilationism, etc.,
thus preventing the various doctrines of annihilation \[of a soul\],
nihilism, \["there is no use in giving," etc.,\] and
moral-inefficacy-of- action, \["there is no other world," etc.\]; for
when states \[are seen to\] arise again and again, each conditioned by
its predecessor, how can the doctrines of annihilationism, nihilism, and
moral-inefficacy-of-action be maintained?



[24.]*The two together*: since any given states are produced
without interrupting the \[cause-fruit\] continuity of any given
combination of conditions, the whole expression "dependent origination"
(*paṭicca-samuppāda*) represents the middle way, which rejects the
doctrines, "He who acts is he who reaps" and "One acts while another
reaps" (S II 20), and which is the proper way described thus, "Not
insisting on local language and not overriding normal usage" (M III
234).4



3\. "The doctrine of eternalism is that beginning 'The world and self
are eternal'" (D I 14). That of no-cause is that beginning, 'There is no
cause, there is no condition, for the defilement of beings' (D I 53).
That of fictitious-cause holds that the world's occurrence is due to
Primordial Essence (*prakºti*), atoms (*aṇu*), time (*kāla*), and so on.
That of a power-wielder asserts the existence of an Overlord (*issara*),
or of a World- soul (*Puruåa*), or of Pajāpati (the Lord of the Race).
Also the doctrines of Nature (*sabhāva,* Skr. *svabhāva* = individual
essence), Fate (*niyati*), and Chance (*yadicchā*), should\
be regarded as included here under the doctrine of no-cause. Some,
however, say that the doctrine of fictitious-cause is that beginning
with 'The eye is the cause of the eye,' and that the doctrine of the
power-wielder is that beginning, 'Things occur owing to their own
individual essence' (see Ch. XVI, n. 23)" (Vism-mhṭ 557).



4\. "Such terms as 'woman,' 'man,' etc., are *local forms of speech*
(*janapada-nirutti*) because even wise men, instead of saying, 'Fetch
the five aggregates,' or 'Let the

This, in the first place, is the meaning of the mere words "dependent



origination" (*paṭicca-samuppāda*).



\[SECTION B. EXPOSITION\]



\[I. PREAMBLE\]



[25.]Now, in teaching this dependent origination the Blessed
One has set forth the text in the way beginning, "With ignorance as
condition there are formations" (S II 20). Its meaning should be
commented on by one who keeps within the circle of the Vibhajjavādins,5
who does not misrepresent the teachers, who does not advertise his own
standpoint, who does not quarrel with the standpoint of others, who does
not distort suttas, who is in agreement with the Vinaya, who looks to
the principal authorities (*mahāpadesa---*D II 123ff.), who illustrates
the law (*dhamma*), who takes up the meaning (*attha*), repeatedly
reverting to that same meaning, describing it in various different
ways.6 And it is inherently difficult to comment on the dependent
origination, as the Ancients said:



mentality-materiality come,' use the current forms 'woman' and 'man.'
This is how, in those who have not fully understood what a physical
basis is, there comes to be the insistence (misinterpretation), 'This is
really a woman, this is really a man.' But since this is a mere concept,
which depends on states made to occur in such and such wise, one who
sees and knows the dependent origination does not insist on
(misinterpret) it as the ultimate meaning. '*Current speech*' is speech
current in the world. '*Not overriding*' is not going beyond. For when
'a being' is said, instead of making an analysis like this, 'What is the
\[lasting\] being here? Is it materiality? Or feeling?' and so on, one
who does not override current usage should express a worldly meaning in
ordinary language as those in the world do, employing the usage current
in the world" (Vism-mhṭ 557-- 58)*.* The explanation differs somewhat
from MN 139.



5\. The term "analyzer" (*vibhajjavādin*) appears at A V 190, and at M
II 197, in this sense, used to describe the Buddha and his followers,
who do not rashly give unqualified answers to questions that need
analyzing before being answered.



6\. "The 'law' (*dhamma*) is the text of the dependent origination. The
"meaning" (*attha*) is the meaning of that. Or they are the cause, and
the fruit of the cause here, is what is meant. Or "law" (*dhamma*) is
regularity (*dhammatā*). Now some, misinterpreting the meaning of the
sutta passage, 'Whether Perfect Ones arise or do not arise, there yet
remains that element ...' (S II 25), wrongly describe the regularity of
the dependent origination as a 'permanent dependent origination,'
instead of which it should be described as having the individual essence
of a cause (*kāraṇa*), defined according to its own fruit, in the way
stated. And some misinterpret the meaning of the dependent origination
thus, 'Without cessation, without arising' (*anuppādaṃ anirodhaṃ*)
instead of taking the unequivocal meaning in the way stated" (Vism-mhṭ
561). The last-mentioned quotation "Without cessation, without arising"
(*anuppādaṃ anirodhaṃ*), seems almost certainly to refer to a well-known
stanza in Nāgārjuna's *Mūlamādhyamika Kārikā*:\
*Anirodhaṃ anutpādaṃ anucchedaṃ aøāsrataṃ\
Anekarthaṃ anānarthaṃ anāgamaṃ anirgamaṃ\
Yaý pratītyasamutpādaṃ prapañcopaøamaṃ øivaṃ\
Deøayamāsa sambuddhas taṃ vande vadatāṃ varaṃ.*

The truth, a being, rebirth-linking,\
And the structure of conditions,\
Are four things very hard to see\
And likewise difficult to teach.



Therefore, considering that to comment on the dependent origination is



impossible except for those who are expert in the texts:



Whilst I would now begin the comment\
On the structure of conditions\
I find no footing for support\
And seem to founder in a sea. \[523\]



However, many modes of teaching\
Grace the Dispensation here,\
And still the former teachers' way\
Is handed down unbrokenly.



Therefore on both of these relying\
For my support, I now begin\
Its meaning to elucidate:\
Listen therefore attentively.



[26.]For this has been said by the former teachers:



Whoever learns alertly this \[discourse\]\
Will go from excellence to excellence,\
And when perfected, he will then escape\
Beyond the vision of the King of Death.



\[II. BRIEF EXPOSITION\]



[27.]So as regards the passages that begin: "With ignorance as
condition there are formations" (S II 20), to start with:



\(1\) As different ways of teaching, (2) meaning,\
(3) Character, (4) singlefold and so on,\
(5) As to defining of the factors,\
The exposition should be known.



[28.] *1.* Herein, as *different ways of teaching*: the Blessed
One's teaching of the dependent origination is fourfold, namely, (i)
from the beginning; or (ii) from the middle up to the end; and (iii)
from the end; or (iv) from the middle down to the beginning. It is like
four creeper-gatherers' ways of seizing a creeper.



[29.](i) For just as one of four men gathering creepers sees
only the root of the creeper first, and after cutting it at the root, he
pulls it all out and takes it away and uses it, so the Blessed One
teaches the dependent origination from the beginning up to the end thus:
"So, bhikkhus, with ignorance as condition there are formations; ...
with birth as condition ageing-and-death" (M I 261).



[30.](ii) Just as another of the four men sees the middle of
the creeper first, and after cutting it in the middle, he pulls out only
the upper part and takes it away and uses it, so the Blessed One teaches
it from the middle up to the end thus:



[]



[]



"When he is delighted with, welcomes, remains committed to that feeling,
then delight arises in him. Delight in feelings is clinging. With his
clinging as condition there is becoming; with becoming as condition,
birth" (M I 266).



[31.] (iii) Just as another of the four men sees the tip of the
creeper first, and seizing the tip, he follows it down to the root and
takes all of it away and uses it, so the Blessed One teaches it from the
end down to the beginning thus: "'With birth as condition,
ageing-and-death,' so it was said. But is there ageing-and- death with
birth as condition, or not, or how is it here?---There is ageing-and-
death with birth as condition, so we think, venerable sir. \[524\] 'With
becoming as condition, birth,' so it was said ... 'With ignorance as
condition there are formations,' so it was said. But are there
formations with ignorance as condition, or not, or how is it
here?---There are formations with ignorance as condition, so we think,
venerable sir" (M I 261).



[32.](iv) Just as one of the four men sees only the middle of
the creeper first, and after cutting it in the middle and tracing it
down as far as the root, he takes it away and uses it, so the Blessed
One teaches it from the middle down to the beginning thus: "And these
four nutriments, bhikkhus: what is their source? What is their origin?
From what are they born? By what are they produced? These four
nutriments have craving as their source, craving as their origin, they
are born from craving, produced by craving. Craving: what is its source?
... Feeling: ... Contact: ... The sixfold base: ...
Mentality-materiality: ... Consciousness: ... Formations: what is their
source? ... By what are they produced? Formations have ignorance as
their source ... they are ... produced by ignorance" (S II 11f.).



[33.] Why does he teach it thus? Because the dependent
origination is wholly beneficial and because he has himself acquired
elegance in instructing. For the dependent origination is entirely
beneficial: starting from any one of the four starting points, it leads
only to the penetration of the proper way. And the Blessed One has
acquired elegance in instructing: it is because he has done so through
possession of the four kinds of perfect confidence and the four
discriminations and by achieving the fourfold profundity (§304) that he
teaches the Dhamma by various methods.



[34.]But it should be recognized, in particular, that (i) when
he sees that people susceptible of teaching are confused about the
analysis of the causes of the process \[of becoming\], he employs his
teaching of it forwards starting from the beginning in order to show
that the process carries on according to its own peculiar laws and for
the purpose of showing the order of arising. (iii) And it should be
recognized that when he surveys the world as fallen upon trouble in the
way stated thus, "This world has fallen upon trouble; it is born, ages,
dies, passes away, and reappears" (S II 10), he employs his teaching of
it backwards starting from the end in order to show the \[laws governing
the\] various kinds of suffering beginning with ageing and death, which
he discovered himself in the early stage of his penetration. And (iv) it
should be recognized that he employs his teaching of it backwards from
the middle down to the beginning in order to show how the succession of
cause and fruit extends back into the past \[existence\],



[]



[]



and again forwards from the past, in accordance with his definition of
nutriment as the source \[of ignorance\] (see M I 47f.). And (ii) it
should be recognized that he employs his teaching of it forwards from
the middle up to the end in order to show how the future \[existence\]
follows on \[through rebirth\] from arousing in the present causes for
\[rebirth\] in the future.



[35.]Of these methods of presentation, that cited here should
be understood to be that stated in forward order starting from the
beginning in order to show to people susceptible of teaching who are
confused about the laws of the process \[of becoming\] that the process
carries on according to its own peculiar laws, \[525\] and for the
purpose of showing the order of arising.



[36.]But why is ignorance stated as the beginning here? How
then, is ignorance the causeless root-cause of the world like the
Primordial Essence of those who assert the existence of a Primordial
Essence? It is not causeless. For a cause of ignorance is stated thus,
"With the arising of cankers there is the arising of ignorance" (M I
54). But there is a figurative way in which it can be treated as the
root cause. What way is that? When it is made to serve as a starting
point in an exposition of the round \[of becoming\].



[37.] For the Blessed One gives the exposition of the round
with one of two things as the starting point: either ignorance,
according as it is said, "No first beginning of ignorance is made known,
bhikkhus, before which there was no ignorance, and after which there
came to be ignorance. And while it is said thus, bhikkhus, nevertheless
it is made known that ignorance has its specific condition" (A V 113);
or craving for becoming, according as it is said, "No first beginning of
craving for becoming is made known, bhikkhus, before which there was no
craving for becoming, and after which there came to be craving for
becoming. And while it is said thus, bhikkhus, nevertheless it is made
known that craving for becoming has its specific condition" (A V 116).



[38.]But why does the Blessed One give the exposition of the
round with those two things as starting points? Because they are the
outstanding causes of kamma that leads to happy and unhappy destinies.



[39.] Ignorance is an outstanding cause of kamma that leads to
unhappy destinies. Why? Because, just as when a cow to be slaughtered is
in the grip of the torment of burning with fire and belabouring with
cudgels, and being crazed with torment, she drinks the hot water
although it gives no satisfaction and does her harm, so the ordinary man
who is in the grip of ignorance performs kamma of the various kinds
beginning with killing living things that leads to unhappy destinies,
although it gives no satisfaction because of the burning of defilements
and does him harm because it casts him into an unhappy destiny.



[40.]But craving for becoming is an outstanding cause of kamma
that leads to happy destinies. Why? Because, just as that same cow,
through her craving for cold water, starts drinking cold water, which
gives satisfaction and allays her torment, so the ordinary man in the
grip of craving for becoming performs kamma of the various kinds
beginning with abstention from killing living things that leads to happy
destinies and gives satisfaction because it is free from the



[]



[]



burning of defilements and, by bringing him to a happy destiny, allays
the torment of suffering \[experienced\] in the unhappy destinies.



[41.]Now, as regards these two states that are starting points
in expositions of the process \[of becoming\], in some instances the
Blessed One teaches the Dhamma based on a single one of these states,
for instance, \[526\] "Accordingly, bhikkhus, formations have ignorance
as their cause, consciousness has formations as its cause" (S II 31),
etc.; likewise, "Bhikkhus, craving increases in one who dwells seeing
enjoyment in things productive of clinging; with craving as condition
there is clinging" (S II 84), and so on. In some instances he does so
based on both, for instance: "So, bhikkhus, for the fool who is hindered
by ignorance and tethered by craving there arises this body. Now, this
body \[with its six internal bases\] and externally \[the six bases due
to\] mentality-materiality make a duality. Due to this duality there is
contact, as well as the six \[pairs of\] bases, touched through which
the fool feels pleasure and pain" (S II 23f.), and so on.



[42.]Of these ways of presentation, that cited here in the form
"With ignorance as condition there are formations" should be understood
as one based on a single state. This, firstly, is how the exposition
should be known "as to different ways of teaching."



[43.]As to meaning: as to the meaning of the words
"ignorance" and so on. Bodily misconduct, etc., for example, "ought not
to be found" (*avindiya*), in the sense of being unfit to be carried
out; the meaning is that it should not be permitted. It finds
(*vindati*) what ought not to be found (*avindiya*), thus it is
ignorance (*avijjā*). Conversely, good bodily conduct, etc. "ought to be
found" (*vindiya*). It does not find (*na vindati*) what ought to be
found (*vindiya*), thus it is ignorance (*avijjā*). Also it prevents
knowing (*avidita*) the meaning of collection in the aggregates, the
meaning of actuating in the bases, the meaning of voidness in the
elements, the meaning of predominance in the faculties, the meaning of
reality in the truths, thus it is ignorance (*avijjā*). Also it prevents
knowing the meaning of suffering, etc., described in four ways as
"oppression," etc. (XVI.15), thus it is ignorance. Through all the kinds
of generations, destinies, becoming, stations of consciousness, and
abodes of beings in the endless round of rebirths it drives beings on
(*AntaVIrahite saṃsāre* ... *satte JAvāpeti*), thus it is ignorance
(*avijjā*). Amongst women, men, etc., which are in the ultimate sense
non-existent, it hurries on (*paramatthato AVIJjamānesu itthi-purisādisu
JAvati*), and amongst the aggregates, etc., which are existent, it does
not hurry on (*vijjamānesu pi khandhādisu na javati*), thus it is
ignorance (*avijjā*). Furthermore, it is ignorance because it conceals
the physical bases and objects of eye-consciousness, etc., and the
dependent origination and dependently-originated states.



[44.]That due to (*paṭicca*) which fruit comes (*eti*) is a
condition (*paccaya*). "Due to" (*paṭicca*) = "not without that"; the
meaning is, not dispensing with it.\
"Comes" (*eti*) means both "arises" and "occurs." Furthermore, the
meaning of "condition" is the meaning of "help." It is ignorance and
that is a condition, thus it is "ignorance as condition," whence the
phrase "with ignorance as condition."



[]



[]



"They form the formed" (S III 87), thus they are formations.
Furthermore, formations are twofold, namely, (a) formations with
ignorance as condition, and (b) formations given in the texts with the
word "formations" (*saṅkhāra*). Herein, (a) the three, namely,
formations of merit, of demerit, and of the imperturbable, and the
three, namely, the bodily, the verbal, and the mental formations, which
make six, are "formations with ignorance as condition." And all these
are simply mundane profitable and unprofitable volition.



[45.] But (b) these four, namely, (i) the formation consisting
of the formed (*saṅkhata*-*saṅkhāra*), \[527\] (ii) the formation
consisting of the kamma-formed (*abhisaṅkhata*-*saṅkhāra*), (iii) the
formation consisting in the act of kamma-forming (forming by
kamma---*abhisaṅkharaṇa*-*saṅkhāra*), and (iv) the formation consisting
in momentum (*payogābhisaṅkhāra*), are the kinds of formations that have
come in the texts with the word "formations."



[46.]Herein, (i) all states with conditions, given in such
passages as "Formations are impermanent" (S I 158; D II 157), are
formations consisting of the formed. (ii) In the Commentaries material
and immaterial states of the three planes generated by kamma are called
formations consisting of the kamma-formed. These are also included in
the passage, "Formations are impermanent." But there is no instance in
the texts where they are found separately. (iii) Profitable and
unprofitable volition of the three planes is called the formation
consisting in the act of kamma-forming. It is found in the texts in such
passages as "Bhikkhus, this man in his ignorance forms the formation of
merit" (S II 82). (iv) But it is bodily and mental energy that is called
the formation consisting in momentum. This is given in the texts in such
passages as "The wheel, having gone as far as the impetus
(*abhisaṅkhāra*) carried it, stood as though it were fixed" (A I 112).



[47.] And not only these, but many other kinds of formations
are given in the texts with the word "formation" (*saṅkhāra*), in the
way beginning, "When a bhikkhu is attaining the cessation of perception
and feeling, friend Visākha, first his verbal formation ceases, then his
bodily formation, then his mental formation" (M I 302). But there is no
formation among them not included by (i) "formations consisting of the
formed."



[48.]What is said next after this in the \[rest of the
exposition\] beginning, "With formations as condition, consciousness"
should be understood in the way already stated. But as to those words
not yet dealt with: It cognizes (*vijānāti*), thus it is consciousness
(*viññāṇa---*see M I 292). It bends \[towards an object\] (*namati*),
thus it is mentality (*nāma*). It is molested (*ruppati*), thus it is
materiality (*rūpa---*see S III 87). It provides a range for the origins
(*āye tanoti*) and it leads on what is actuated (*āyatañ ca nayati*),
thus it is a base (*āyatana---*see XV.4). It touches (*phusati*), thus
it is contact (*phassa*). It is felt (*vedayati*), thus it is feeling
(*vedanā---* see M I 293). It frets (or it thirsts---*paritassati*),
thus it is craving (*taṇhā*). It clings (*upādiyati*), thus it is
clinging (*upādāna*). It becomes (*bhavati*) and it makes become
(*bhāvayati*), thus it is becoming (*bhava*). The act of being born is
birth. The act of growing old is ageing. By means of it they die, thus
it is death. The act of sorrowing is sorrow. The act of lamenting is
lamentation. It makes \[beings\] suffer (*dukkhayati*), thus it is pain
(*dukkha*); or it consumes in two ways (*DVedhā*



[]



[]



*KHAṇati---*see IV.100) by means of \[the two moments (*khaṇa*)\]
arising and presence, thus it is pain (*dukkha*). The state of a sad
mind (*dummana*-*bhāva*) is grief (*domanassa*). Great misery (*bhuso
āyāso*) is despair (*upāyāsa*).  *There is* means "is generated."



[49.]And the words "There is" should be construed with all the
terms, not only with those beginning with sorrow; for otherwise, when
"With ignorance as condition, formations" was said, it would not be
evident what they did, but by construing it with the words "There is"
(or "there are"), since "ignorance as condition" stands for "it is
ignorance and that is a condition," consequently \[528\] the defining of
the condition and the conditionally-arisen state is effected by the
words "with ignorance as condition there are formations." And so in each
instance.



[50.] Thus signifies the process described. By that he shows
that it is with ignorance, etc., as the causes and not with creation by
an Overlord, and so on. Of that: of that aforesaid. Whole: unmixed,
entire. *Mass of suffering*: totality of suffering; not a living being,
not pleasure, beauty, and so on. *Arising*: generating. *There is*: is
brought about.



This is how the exposition should be known here "as to meaning."



[51.] *3.* As to *character*, etc.: as to the characteristics
of ignorance, etc., that is to say, *ignorance* has the characteristic
of unknowing. Its function is to confuse. It is manifested as
concealing. Its proximate cause is cankers. *Formations* have the
characteristic of forming. Their function is to accumulate.7 They are
manifested as volition. Their proximate cause is ignorance.
*Consciousness* has the characteristic of cognizing. Its function is to
go before (see Dhp 1). It manifests itself as rebirth-linking. Its
proximate cause is formations; or its proximate cause is the
physical-basis-cum-object. *Mentality * (*nāma*) has the characteristic
of bending (*namana*). Its function is to associate. It is manifested as
inseparability of its components, \[that is, the three aggregates\]. Its
proximate cause is consciousness.  *Materiality*  (*rūpa*) has the
characteristic of being molested (*ruppana*). Its function is to be
dispersed. It is manifested as \[morally\] indeterminate. Its proximate
cause is consciousness. The sixfold base (*saḷāyatana*) has the
characteristic of actuating (*āyatana*). Its function is to see, and so
on. It is manifested as the state of physical basis and door. Its
proximate cause is mentality-materiality.  *Contact* has the
characteristic of touching. Its function is impingement. It manifests
itself as coincidence \[of internal and external base



7\. "Formations '*accumulate*,' work, for the purpose of rebirth. So
that is their function. To accumulate is to heap up. Consciousness's
function is '*to go before*' since it precedes mentality-materiality at
rebirth-linking. Mentality's function is '*to associate*'* * since it
joins with consciousness in a state of mutuality. '*Inseparability of
its components*'* * is owing to their having no separate existence
\[mentality here being feeling, perception, and formations\].
Materiality is dispersible since it has in itself nothing \[beyond the
water element\] to hold it \[absolutely\] together, so '*its function is
to be dispersed*'; that is why, when rice grains, etc., are pounded,
they get scattered and reduced to powder. It is called '*indeterminate*'
to distinguish it from mentality, which is profitable, etc., at
different times" (Vism-mhṭ 571).



[]



[]



and consciousness\]. Its proximate cause is the sixfold base. *Feeling*
has the characteristic of experiencing. Its function is to exploit the
stimulus of the objective field. It is manifested as pleasure and pain.
Its proximate cause is contact. *Craving* has the characteristic of
being a cause \[that is, of suffering\]. Its function is to delight. It
is manifested as insatiability. Its proximate cause is feeling.
*Clinging* has the characteristic of seizing. Its function is not to
release. It is manifested as a strong form of craving and as \[false\]
view. Its proximate cause is craving. *Becoming* has the characteristic
of being kamma and kamma-result. Its function is to make become and to
become. It is manifested as profitable, unprofitable, and indeterminate.
Its proximate cause is clinging. The characteristic of *birth*, etc.,
should be understood as stated in the Description of the Truths
(XVI.32f.). This is how the exposition should be known here "as to
character, etc."



[52.] *4.*  *As to singlefold, and so on*: here *ignorance* is
singlefold as unknowing, unseeing, delusion, and so on. It is twofold as
"no theory" and "wrong theory" (cf. §303);8 likewise as prompted and
unprompted. It is threefold as associated with the three kinds of
feeling. It is fourfold as non-penetration of the four truths. It is
fivefold as concealing the danger in the five kinds of destinies.
\[529\] It should, however, be understood that all the immaterial
factors \[of the dependent origination\] have a sixfold nature with
respect to the \[six\] doors and objects.



[53.]*Formations* are singlefold as states subject to cankers
(Dhs 3), states with the nature of result (Dhs 1), and so on (cf. Vibh
62).9 They are twofold as profitable and unprofitable; likewise as
limited and exalted, inferior and medium, with certainty of wrongness
and without certainty. They are threefold as the formation of merit and
the rest. They are fourfold as leading to the four kinds of generation.
They are fivefold as leading to the five kinds of destiny.



[54.] *Consciousness* is singlefold as mundane (Dhs 3),
resultant (Dhs 1), and so on. It is twofold as with root-cause and
without root-cause and so on. It is threefold as included in the three
kinds of becoming; as associated with the three kinds of feeling; and as
having no root-cause, having two root-causes, and having three
root-causes. It is fourfold and fivefold \[respectively\] according to
generation and destiny.



[55.] *Mentality-materiality* is singlefold as dependent on
consciousness, and as having kamma as its condition. It is twofold as
having an object \[in the case of mentality\], and having no object \[in
the case of materiality\]. It is threefold as



8\. "'*No theory*'* * is unknowing about suffering, etc., '*wrong
theory*'* * is perverted perception of what is foul, etc., as beautiful,
etc., or else '*no theory*' is unassociated with \[false\] view, and
'*wrong theory*' is associated with it" (Vism-mhṭ 751). This use of the
word *paṭipatti* as "theory," rare in Pali but found in Sanskrit, is not
in PED. An alternative rendering for these two terms might be
"agnosticism" and "superstition" (see also XIV.163, 177).\



9\. "'*With the nature of result, and so on*': the words 'and so on'
here include 'neither- trainer-nor-non-trainer,' (Dhs 2) 'conducive to
fetters' (Dhs 3), and so on. \[§54\] '*Mundane resultant and so on*':
the words 'and so on' here include 'indeterminate' (Dhs 2), 'formed'
(Dhs 2), and so on. '*With root*-*cause and without root*-*cause, and so
on*': the words 'and so on' here include 'prompted,' 'unprompted,' and
so on" (Vism-mhṭ).



[]



[]



past, and so on. It is fourfold and fivefold respectively according to
generation and destiny.



[56.]*The sixfold base* is singlefold as the place of origin
and meeting. It is twofold as sensitivity of primary elements and as
consciousness \[of the sixth base\], and so on. It is threefold as
having for its domain \[objective fields that are\] contiguous,
non-contiguous, and neither (see XIV.46). It is fourfold and fivefold
respectively as included in the kinds of generation and destiny.



The singlefoldness, etc., of *contact*, etc., should be understood in
this way too.



This is how the exposition should be known here "as to singlefold and so



on."



[57.] *5.* *As to defining of the factors*: sorrow, etc., are
stated here for the purpose of showing that the Wheel of Becoming never
halts; for they are produced in the fool who is afflicted by ageing and
death, according as it is said: "The untaught ordinary man, bhikkhus, on
being touched by painful bodily feeling, sorrows, grieves and laments,
beating his breast, he weeps and becomes distraught" (M III 285; S IV
206). And as long as these go on occurring so long does ignorance, and
so the Wheel of Becoming renews \[its revolution\]: "With ignorance as
condition there are formations" and so on. That is why the factors of
the dependent origination should be understood as twelve by taking those
\[that is, sorrow, etc.,\] along with ageing-and-death as one
summarization. This is how the exposition should be known here "as to
defining of the factors."



[58.] This, firstly, is the brief treatment. The following
method, however, is in detail.



\[III. DETAILED EXPOSITION\]



\[(I) IGNORANCE\]



According to the Suttanta method \[530\] ignorance is unknowing about
the four instances beginning with suffering. According to the Abhidhamma
method it is unknowing about the eight instances \[that is to say, the
above-mentioned four\] together with \[the four\] beginning with the
past; for this is said: "Herein, what is ignorance? It is unknowing
about suffering, \[unknowing about the origin of suffering, unknowing
about the cessation of suffering, unknowing about the way leading to the
cessation of suffering\], unknowing about the past, unknowing about the
future, unknowing about the past and future, unknowing about specific
conditionality and conditionally-arisen states" (cf. Dhs §1162).



[59.] Herein, while ignorance about any instance that is not
the two supra- mundane truths can also arise as object (see §102),
nevertheless here it is only intended \[subjectively\] as concealment.
For when \[thus\] arisen it keeps the truth of  *suffering* concealed,
preventing penetration of the true individual function and
characteristic of that truth. Likewise, origin, cessation, and the path,
bygone five aggregates called *the past*, coming five aggregates called
*the future*, both of these together called *the past and future*, and
both specific conditionality and conditionally-arisen states together
called *specific conditionality and conditionally- arisen states---*all
of which it keeps concealed, preventing their true individual



[]



[]



functions and characteristics being penetrated thus: "This is ignorance,
these are formations." That is why it is said, "It is unknowing about
suffering ... unknowing about specific conditionality and
conditionally-arisen states."



\[(II) FORMATIONS\]



[60.] *Formations* are the six mentioned in brief above thus,
"the three, namely, formations of merit, etc., and the three, namely,
the bodily formation, etc." (§44); but in detail here the \[first\]
three formations are twenty-nine volitions, that is to say, the
formation of merit consisting of thirteen volitions, counting the eight
sense-sphere profitable volitions that occur in giving, in virtue, etc.,
and the five fine-material profitable volitions that occur in
development \[of meditation\]; then the formation of demerit consisting
of the twelve unprofitable volitions that occur in killing living
things, etc.; then the formation of the imperturbable consisting in the
four profitable volitions associated with the immaterial sphere, which
occur in development \[of those meditations\].



[61.]As regards the other three, the bodily formation is bodily
volition, the verbal formation is verbal volition, and the mental
formation is mental volition. This triad is mentioned in order to show
that at the moment of the accumulation of the kamma the formations of
merit, etc., occur in these \[three\] kamma doors. For the eight
sense-sphere profitable and twelve unprofitable volitions, making
twenty, are the bodily formation when they occur in the body door and
produce bodily intimation. Those same volitions \[531\] are called the
verbal formation when they occur in the speech door and produce verbal
intimation. But volition connected with direct-knowledge is not included
here in these two cases because it is not a condition for \[resultant
rebirth-linking\] consciousness later. And like direct- knowledge
volition, so also volition connected with agitation is not included;
therefore that too should not be included as a condition for
\[rebirth-linking\] consciousness. However, all these have ignorance as
their condition. And all the twenty-nine volitions are the mental
formation when they arise in the mind door without originating either
kind of intimation. So this triad comes within the first triad, and
accordingly, as far as the meaning is concerned, ignorance can be
understood as condition simply for formations of merit and so on.



[62.]Herein, it might be \[asked\]: How can it be known that
these formations have ignorance as their condition?---By the fact that
they exist when ignorance exists. For when unknowing---in other words,
ignorance---of suffering, etc., is unabandoned in a man, owing firstly
to his unknowing about suffering and about the past, etc., then he
believes the suffering of the round of rebirths to be pleasant and he
embarks upon the three kinds of formations which are the cause of that
very suffering. Owing to his unknowing about suffering's origin he
embarks upon formations that, being subordinated to craving, are
actually the cause of suffering, imagining them to be the cause of
pleasure. And owing to his unknowing about cessation and the path, he
misperceives the cessation of suffering to be in some particular destiny
\[such as the Brahmā-world\] that is not in fact cessation; he
misperceives the path to cessation, believing it to consist in
sacrifices, mortification for immortality, etc., which are not in fact
the path to cessation; and so while aspiring to the cessation of
suffering, he embarks upon



[]



[]



the three kinds of formations in the form of sacrifices, mortification
for immortality, and so on.



[63.]Furthermore, his non-abandonment of that ignorance about
the four truths in particular prevents him from recognizing as suffering
the kind of suffering called the fruit of merit, which is fraught with
the many dangers beginning with birth, ageing, disease and death, and so
he embarks upon the formation of merit classed as bodily, verbal, and
mental formations, in order to attain that \[kind of suffering\], like
one desiring celestial nymphs \[who jumps over\] a cliff. Also, not
seeing how that fruit of merit reckoned as pleasure eventually breeds
great distress owing to the suffering in its change and that it gives
little satisfaction, he embarks upon the formation of merit of the kinds
already stated, which is the condition for that very \[suffering in
change\], like a moth that falls into a lamp's flame, and like the man
who wants the drop of honey and licks the honey-smeared knife-edge.
Also, not seeing the danger in the indulgence of sense desires, etc.,
with its results, \[wrongly\] perceiving pleasure and overcome by
defilements, he embarks upon the formation of demerit that occurs in the
three doors \[of kamma\], like a child who plays with filth, and like a
man who wants to die and eats poison. Also, unaware of the suffering due
to formations and the suffering-in-change \[inherent\] in kamma-results
in the immaterial sphere, owing to the perversion of \[wrongly
perceiving them as\] eternal, etc., he embarks upon the formation of the
imperturbable which is a mental formation, like one who has lost his way
and takes the road to a goblin city.



[64.]So formations exist only when ignorance exists, \[532\]
not when it does not; and that is how it can be known that these
formations have ignorance as their condition.



This is said too: "Not knowing, bhikkhus, in ignorance, he forms the
formation of merit, forms the formation of demerit, forms the formation
of the imperturbable. As soon as a bhikkhu's ignorance is abandoned and
clear vision arisen, bhikkhus, with the fading away of ignorance and the
arising of clear vision he does not form even formations of merit" (cf.
S II 82).



[65.]Here it might be said: "Let us then firstly agree that
ignorance is a condition for formations. But it must now be stated for
which formations, and in which way it is a condition."



Here is the reply: "Twenty-four conditions have been stated by the
Blessed



One as follows."



\[The 24 Conditions\]



[66.]"(1) Root-cause condition, (2) object condition, (3)
predominance condition, (4) proximity condition, (5) contiguity
condition, (6) conascence condition, (7) mutuality condition, (8)
support condition, (9) decisive-support condition, (10) prenascence
condition, (11) postnascence condition, (12) repetition condition, (13)
kamma condition, (14) kamma-result condition, (15) nutriment condition,
(16) faculty condition, (17) jhāna condition, (18) path condition, (19)
association condition, (20) dissociation condition, (21) presence
condition, (22) absence



[]



[]



condition, (23) disappearance condition, (24) non-disappearance
condition" (Paṭṭh I 1).



[67.](1) Herein, it is a root-cause and a condition, thus it is
*root-cause condition*. It is by its being a root-cause that it is a
condition; what is meant is that it is a condition owing to its status
as root-cause. The same method applies in the case of object condition
and the rest.



Herein, "cause" (*hetu*) is a term for a part of a syllogism, for a
reason, and for a root. For with the words "proposition" (*paṭiññā*),
"cause" (*hetu* = middle term), etc., in the world it is a member of a
syllogism (*vacanāvayava*) that is called a cause. But in the
Dispensation, in such passages as "Those states that are produced from a
cause" (Vin I 40), it is a reason (*kāraṇa*); and in such passages as
"Three profitable \[root-\] causes, three unprofitable \[root-\]causes"
(Dhs §1053), it is a root (*mūla*) that is called a cause. The last is
intended here.



[68.] As to "condition" (*paccaya*), the word-meaning here is
this: It \[the fruit\] comes from that, depending thereon (*paṭicca
etasmā eti*), thus that is a condition; (*paccaya*, see note 2) the
meaning is, \[a state\] occurs by not dispensing with that. What is
meant is: when a state is indispensable to another state's presence or
arising, the former is a condition for the latter. But as to
characteristic, a condition has the characteristic of assisting; for any
given state \[533\] that assists the presence or arising of a given
state is called the latter's condition. The words condition, cause,
reason, source, originator, producer, etc., are one in meaning though
different in the letter. So, since it is a cause in the sense of a root,
and a condition in the sense of assistance, briefly a state that is
assistantial in the sense of a root is a \[root-\]cause condition.



[69.] The intention of \[some\] teachers is that it establishes
the profitable, etc., state in what is profitable, etc., as paddy seeds,
etc., do for paddy, etc., and as the colour of gems, etc., do for the
lustre of gems, and so on.10 But if that is so, then \[it follows that\]
the state of root-cause condition does not apply to the kinds of
materiality originated by it, for it does not establish any
profitableness, etc., in them. Nevertheless, it is a condition for them,
for this is said: "Root-causes are a condition, as root-cause condition,
for the states associated with a root-cause and for the kinds of
materiality originated thereby" (Paṭṭh I 1). Again, the
indeterminateness of root-causeless consciousness is established without
it. And the profitableness, etc., of those with root-cause is bound up
with wise attention, etc., not with the associated root-causes. And if
the profitableness, etc., resided in the associated root-causes as an
individual essence, then either the non-greed bound up with the
root-cause in the associated states would be only profitable or it would
be only indeterminate; but since it can be both, profitableness, etc.,
in the root-causes must still be sought for, just as in the associated
states \[such as wise attention, and so on\].



[70.]But when the root-causes' sense of root is taken as
establishing stableness, rather than as establishing profitableness,
etc., there is no contradiction. For states that have obtained a
root-cause condition are firm, like trees, and stable;



[10.]"This refers to the teacher Revata" (Vism-mhṭ 582).



[]



[]



but those without root-cause are, like moss \[with roots no bigger
than\] sesame seeds, etc., unstable. So an assistantial state may be
understood as a root-cause condition, since it establishes stableness
through being of assistance in the sense of a root.



[71.](2) As to the others that follow, a state that assists by
being an object is an *object condition*. Now, there are no states that
are not object conditions; for the passage beginning "The visible-data
base \[is a condition, as object condition,\] for the eye-consciousness
element" concludes thus: "When any states, as states of consciousness
and consciousness-concomitants, arise contingent upon any states, these
\[latter\] states are conditions, as object condition, for those
\[former\] states" (Paṭṭh I 1).11 For just as a weak man both gets up
and stands by hanging on to (*ālambitvā*) a stick or rope, so states of
consciousness and consciousness- concomitants always arise and are
present contingent upon visible data, etc., as their object (*ārammaṇa *
=  *ālambana*). Therefore all states that are objects of\
consciousness and consciousness-concomitants should be understood as
object condition. \[534\]



[72.] (3) A state that assists in the sense of being foremost
is a *predominance* *condition*. It is of two kinds as conascent and as
object. Herein, because of the passage beginning "Predominance of zeal
is a condition, as predominance condition, for states associated with
zeal and for the kinds of materiality originated thereby" (Paṭṭh I 2),
it is the four states called zeal, \[purity of\] consciousness, energy,
and inquiry, that should be understood as predominance condition; but
not simultaneously, for when consciousness occurs with emphasis on zeal
and putting zeal foremost, then it is zeal and not the others that is
predominant. So with the rest. But the state, by giving importance to
which, immaterial states occur, is their *object-predominance*. Hence it
is said: "When any states, as states of consciousness and
consciousness-concomitants, arise by giving importance to any states,
these \[latter\] states are a condition, as predominance condition, for
those \[former\] states" (Paṭṭh I 2).



[73.] (4), (5) A state that assists by being proximate is a
*proximity condition*. A state that assists by being contiguous is a
*contiguity condition*. The explanation of this pair of conditions is
very diffuse, but substantially it is this:12 the regular order of
consciousness begins thus, mind element is proximate (next) after eye-
consciousness, mind-consciousness element is proximate (next) after mind
element, and this is established only by each preceding consciousness,
not otherwise; consequently, a state that is capable of arousing an
appropriate kind



11\. "'*Which are contingent upon other such states*': because it is
said without distinction of all visible-data bases ... and of all
mental-data bases, there is consequently no dhamma (state) among the
formed, unformed, and conceptual dhammas, classed as sixfold under
visible data, etc., that does not become an object condition" (Vism-mhṭ
584).\



12\. "Proximity and contiguity conditions are not stated in accordance
with the distinction between making occur and giving opportunity, as the
absence and disappearance conditions are: rather they are stated as the
causes of the regular order of consciousness \[in the cognitive
series\]" (Vism-mhṭ 585).



[]



[]



of consciousness proximate (next) to itself is a proximity condition.
Hence it is said: "Proximity condition: eye-consciousness and the states
associated therewith are a condition, as proximity condition, for mind
element and for the states associated therewith" (Paṭṭh I 2).



[74.](5) Proximity condition is the same as contiguity
condition. The difference here is only in the letter, there is none in
the meaning; just as in the case of the words "growth" and "continuity"
(XIV.66), etc., and as in the case of the "terminology dyad," "language
dyad," (Dhs §1306) and so on.



[75.] The opinion of \[certain\] teachers13 is that proximity
condition refers to proximity of aim (fruit) and contiguity condition
refers to proximity of time. But that is contradicted by such statements
as "The profitable \[consciousness\] belonging to the base consisting of
neither perception nor non-perception in one who emerges from cessation
is a condition, as contiguity condition, for fruition attainment
\[consciousness\]" (Paṭṭh I 160).



[76.] Now, they say in this context that "the ability of states
to produce \[their fruit\] is not diminished, but the influence of
meditative development prevents states from arising in proximity." But
that only establishes that there is no proximity of time; and we also
say the same, namely, that there is no proximity of time there owing to
the influence of development. \[535\] But since there is no proximity of
time, the state of contiguity condition is therefore impossible
\[according to them\] since their belief is that the contiguity
condition depends on proximity of time (cf. M-a II 363). Instead of
adopting any such misinterpretation, the difference should be treated as
residing in the letter only, not in the meaning. How? There is no
interval (*antara*) between them, thus they are proximate (*anantara*);
they are quite without interval because \[even the distinction of\] co-
presence is lacking, thus they are contiguous (*samanantara*).14



[77.] (6) A state that, while arising, assists \[another
state\] by making it arise together with itself is a *conascence
condition*, as a lamp is for illumination. With the immaterial
aggregates, etc., it is sixfold, according as it is said: "(i) The four
immaterial aggregates are a condition, as conascence condition, for each
other, (ii) the four great primaries are ... for each other; (iii) at
the moment of descent into the womb mentality and materiality are ...
for each other; (iv) states of consciousness and its concomitants are
... for the kinds of materiality originated



13\. "This refers to the Elder Revata too" (Vism-mhṭ 586).\



14\. "The state *of proximity condition* is the ability to cause arising
proximately (without interval) because there is no interval between the
cessation of the preceding and the arising of the subsequent. The state
of *contiguity condition* is the ability to cause arising by being quite
proximate (without interval) through approaching, as it were, identity
with itself owing to absence of any distinction that 'This is below,
above, or around that,' which is because of lack of any such co-presence
as in the case of the \[components of the\] material groups, and because
of lack of any co-positionality of the condition and the conditionally
arisen. And \[in general\], because of the uninterestedness of \[all\]
states (*dhamma*), when a given \[state\] has ceased, or is present, in
a given mode, and \[other\] states (*dhamma*) come to be possessed of
that particular mode, it is that \[state's\] mode that must be regarded
as what is called 'ability to cause arising'" (Vism-mhṭ 586).



[]



[]



by consciousness; (v) the great primaries are ... for derived
materiality; (vi) material states are sometimes \[as at
rebirth-linking\] a condition, as conascence condition, and sometimes
\[as in the course of an existence\] not a condition as conascence
condition, for immaterial states" (Paṭṭh I 3). This refers only to the
heart-basis.



[78.](7) A state that assists by means of mutual arousing and
consolidating is a *mutuality condition*, as the three sticks of a
tripod give each other consolidating support. With the immaterial
aggregates, etc., it is threefold, according as it is said: "The four
immaterial aggregates are a condition, as mutuality condition, \[for
each other\]; the four great primaries are a condition, as mutuality
condition, \[for each other\]; at the moment of descent into the womb
mentality and materiality are a condition, as mutuality condition, \[for
each other\]" (Paṭṭh I 3).



[79.](8) A state that assists in the mode of foundation and in
the mode of support is a *support condition*, as the earth is for trees,
as canvas is for paintings, and so on. It should be understood in the
way stated for conascence thus: "The four immaterial aggregates are a
condition, as support condition, for each other" (Paṭṭh I 3), but the
sixth instance has been set forth in this way here: "The eye base \[is a
condition, as support condition,\] for the eye-consciousness element
\[and for the states associated therewith\]; the ear base ... the nose
base ... the tongue base ... the body base is a condition, as support
condition, for the body- consciousness element and for the states
associated therewith; the materiality with which as their support the
mind element and the mind-consciousness element occur is a condition, as
support condition, for the mind element, for the mind- consciousness
element, and for the states associated therewith" (Paṭṭh I 4).



[80.] (9)  *Decisive-support condition*: firstly, here is the
word-meaning: \[536\] it is treated as support, not dispensed with, by
its own fruit because \[its own fruit's\] existence is dependent on it,
thus it is the support. But just as great misery is despair, so great
support is decisive support. This is a term for a cogent reason.
Consequently, a state that assists by being a cogent reason should be
understood as a decisive-support condition.



It is threefold, namely, (a) object-decisive-support, (b)
proximate-decisive-



support, and (c) natural-decisive-support condition.



[81.] (a) Herein, firstly, *object-decisive-support* condition
is set forth without differentiating it from object-predominance in the
way beginning: "Having given a gift, having undertaken the precepts of
virtue, having done the duties of the Uposatha, a man gives that
importance and reviews it; he gives importance to former things well
done and reviews them. Having emerged from jhāna, he gives jhāna
importance and reviews it. Trainers give importance to change-of-
lineage and review it. They give importance to cleansing and review
it.15 Trainers, having emerged from a path, give importance to the path
and review it" (Paṭṭh I 165). Herein, the object in giving importance to
which consciousness



15\. "Reviewing change-of-lineage" (the consciousness that precedes the
path consciousness) applies to stream-enterers. "Reviewing cleansing"
(the "cleansing" that consists in attaining a higher path than the
first) applies to once-returners and non-returners (see Vism-mhṭ 589).



[]



[]



and consciousness concomitants arise, is necessarily a cogent one among
these objects. So their difference may be understood in this way:
*object-predominance* is in the sense of what is to be given importance
to, and *object-decisive-support* is in the sense of a cogent reason.



[82.] (b) Also *proximate-decisive-support condition* is set
forth without differentiating it from the proximity condition in the way
beginning, "Any preceding profitable aggregates are a condition, as
decisive-support condition, for any succeeding aggregates" (Paṭṭh I
165). But in the exposition there is a distinction, because in the
exposition of the schedule (*mātikā-nikkhepa*) they are given as
proximity in the way beginning, "Eye-consciousness element and the
states associated therewith are a condition, as proximity condition, for
mind element and for the states associated therewith" (Paṭṭh I 2) and as
decisive- support in the way beginning, "Any preceding profitable states
are a condition as decisive-support condition, for any succeeding
profitable states" (Paṭṭh I 4), though it comes to the same thing as
regards the meaning. Nevertheless, *proximity* may be understood as the
ability to cause the occurrence of an appropriate conscious arising
proximate (next) to itself, and *decisive support* as the preceding
consciousness's cogency in the arousing of the succeeding
consciousnesses.



[83.] For while in the cases of root-cause and other such
conditions consciousness can arise actually without any of those
conditions, there is no arising of consciousness without a proximate
consciousness \[to precede it\], so this is a cogent condition. Their
difference, then, may be understood in this way: *proximity condition*
arouses an appropriate consciousness proximate (next) to itself, while
*proximity-decisive-support condition* is a cogent reason.



[84.](c) As to *natural-decisive-support*: the decisive-support
is natural, thus it is a natural-decisive-support. Faith, virtue, etc.,
produced in, or climate, food, etc., habitual to, one's own continuity
are called natural. Or else, it is a decisive- support by nature,
\[537\] thus it is a natural-decisive-support. The meaning is that it is
unmixed with object and proximity. It should be understood as variously
divided up in the way beginning: "Natural-decisive-support: with faith
as decisive-support a man gives a gift, undertakes the precepts of
virtue, does the duties of the Uposatha, arouses jhāna, arouses insight,
arouses the path, arouses direct-knowledge, arouses an attainment. With
virtue ... With learning ... With generosity ... With understanding as
decisive-support a man gives a gift ... arouses an attainment. Faith,
virtue, learning, generosity, understanding, are conditions, as
decisive-support condition, for \[the repeated arising of\] faith,
virtue, learning, generosity, understanding" (Paṭṭh I 165). So these
things beginning with faith are natural-decisive-support since they are
both natural and decisive-supports in the sense of a cogent reason.



[85.] (10) A state that assists by being present, having arisen
previously, is a *prenascence condition*. It is elevenfold as physical
basis and object in the five doors, and as the heart-basis, according as
it is said: "The eye base is a condition, as prenascence condition, for
the eye-consciousness element and for the states associated therewith.
The ear base ... The nose base ... The tongue base ... The



[]



[]



body base ... The visible-data base ... The sound base ... The odour
base ... The flavour base ... The tangible-data base is a condition, as
prenascence condition, for the body-consciousness element and for the
states associated therewith. The visible-data base ... The sound base
... The odour base ... The flavour base ... the tangible data base \[is
a condition, as prenascence condition,\] for the mind element. The
materiality with which as their support the mind element and mind-
consciousness element occur is a condition, as prenascence condition,
for the mind-element and for the states associated therewith, and it is
sometimes \[as in the course of an existence\] a condition, as
prenascence condition, sometimes \[as at rebirth-linking\] not a
condition, as prenascence condition, for the mind- consciousness element
and for the states associated therewith" (Paṭṭh I 4--5).



[86.] (11) An immaterial state that \[while present\] assists
prenascent material states \[also present\] by consolidating them is a
*postnascence condition*, like the volition of appetite for food, which
assists the bodies of vultures' young. Hence it is said: "Postnascent
\[538\] states of consciousness and its concomitants are a condition, as
postnascence condition, for the prenascent \[co-present\] body" (Paṭṭh I
5).



[87.](12) A state that assists the efficiency and power of the
proximate (next) in the sense of repetition is a *repetition condition*,
like repeated application to books and so on. It is threefold as
profitable, unprofitable, and functional impulsion; for it is said:
"Preceding profitable states are a condition, as repetition condition,
for succeeding profitable states ... Preceding unprofitable ...
Preceding functional indeterminate states are a condition, as repetition
condition, for succeeding functional indeterminate states" (Paṭṭh I 5).



[88.] (13) A state that assists by means of the action called
intervening of consciousness is a *kamma condition*. It is twofold as
(a) profitable and unprofitable volition acting from a different time,
and (b) as all conascent volition (see Paṭṭh I 172), according as it is
said: "Profitable and unprofitable kamma is a condition, as kamma
condition, for resultant aggregates and for the kinds of materiality due
to kamma performed. Conascent volition is a condition, as kamma
condition, for associated states and for the kinds of materiality
originated thereby" (Paṭṭh I 5).



[89.] (14) A resultant state that, by effortless quiet, assists
effortless quiet \[in other states\] is a *kamma-result condition*. In
the course of an existence it is a condition for states originated by
it, and at rebirth-linking for the kinds of materiality due to kamma
performed, and in both cases for the associated states, according as it
is said: "One resultant indeterminate aggregate is a condition, as
kamma-result condition, for three aggregates and for the kinds of
materiality originated by consciousness ... At the moment of
rebirth-linking one resultant indeterminate aggregate \[is a condition
...\] for three aggregates ... Three aggregates \[are a condition ...\]
for one aggregate ... Two aggregates are a condition, as kamma-result
condition, for two aggregates and for the kinds of materiality due to
kamma performed. Aggregates are a condition, as kamma- result condition,
for the physical basis" (Paṭṭh I 173).



[90.] (15) The four kinds of nutriment, which assist material
and immaterial



states by consolidating them, are *nutriment conditions*, according as
it is said:



[]



[]



"Physical nutriment is a condition, as nutriment condition, for this
body. Immaterial nutriments are conditions, as nutriment condition, for
associated states and for the kinds of materiality originated by them"
(Paṭṭh I 5). But in the Question Section it is said: "At the moment of
rebirth-linking, resultant indeterminate nutriments are conditions, as
nutriment condition, for aggregates associated therewith and for the
kinds of materiality due to kamma performed" (Paṭṭh I 174).



[91.] (16) Leaving out the femininity and masculinity
faculties, the twenty remaining faculties (see XIV.1), which assist in
the sense of predominance, \[539\] are *faculty conditions*. Herein, the
five, namely, the eye faculty, etc., are conditions only for immaterial
states, the rest are conditions for material and immaterial states,
according as it is said: "The eye faculty \[is a condition, as faculty
condition,\] for eye-consciousness element \[and for the states
associated therewith\]. The ear faculty ... The nose faculty ... The
tongue faculty ... The body faculty is a condition, as faculty
condition, for the body-consciousness element and for the states
associated therewith. The material life faculty is a condition, as
faculty condition, for the kinds of materiality due to kamma performed.
The immaterial faculties are a condition, as faculty condition, for the
states associated therewith and for the kinds of materiality originated
thereby" (Paṭṭh 1, 5--6). But in the Question Section it is said: "At
the moment of rebirth-linking resultant indeterminate faculties are a
condition, as faculty condition, for associated aggregates and for the
kinds of materiality due to kamma performed" (Paṭṭh I 175).



[92.](17) All the seven jhāna factors classed as profitable,
etc.---leaving out the pair, pleasant and painful feeling, in the case
of the two sets of five consciousnesses---which factors assist in the
sense of constituting a state of jhāna, are *jhāna conditions*,
according as it is said: "The jhāna factors are a condition, as jhāna
condition, for the states associated with jhāna and for the kinds of
materiality originated thereby" (Paṭṭh I 6). But in the Question Section
it is said: "At the moment of rebirth-linking, resultant indeterminate
jhāna factors are a condition, as jhāna condition, for associated
aggregates and for the kinds of materiality due to kamma performed"
(Paṭṭh I 175).



[93.](18) The twelve path factors classed as profitable, etc.,
which assist in the sense of an outlet from whatever it may be, are
*path conditions*, according as it is said: "The path factors are a
condition, as path condition, for states associated therewith and for
the kinds of materiality originated thereby" (Paṭṭh I 6). But in the
Question Section it is said: "At the moment of rebirth-linking,
resultant indeterminate path factors are a condition, as path condition,
for aggregates associated therewith and for the kinds of materiality due
to kamma performed" (Paṭṭh I 176).



But these two, namely, jhāna and path conditions, should be understood
as inapplicable to the two sets of five consciousnesses and to the
consciousnesses without root-cause ((34)--(41), (50)--(56), (70)--(72)).



[94.] (19) Immaterial states that assist by the kind of
association consisting in



having the same physical basis, same object, same arising, same
cessation, are



[]



[]



*association conditions*, according as it is said: "The four immaterial
aggregates are a condition, as association condition, for each other"
(Paṭṭh I 6).



[95.](20) Material states that assist immaterial states, and
immaterial states that assist material states by not having sameness of
physical basis, etc., are *dissociation conditions*. This is threefold
as conascent, postnascent, and prenascent, for this is said: "Conascent
profitable aggregates are a condition, as dissociation condition, for
the kinds of materiality originated by consciousness. Postnascent
\[540\] profitable \[mental\] aggregates are a condition, as
dissociation condition, for this prenascent body" (Paṭṭh I 176). But in
the analysis of the conascent in the indeterminate clause it is said:
"At the moment of rebirth-linking, resultant indeterminate aggregates
are a condition, as dissociation condition, for the kinds of materiality
due to kamma performed. The aggregates are a condition, as dissociation
condition, for the physical basis, and the physical basis for the
aggregates" (Paṭṭh I 176). But the prenascent should be understood as
the eye faculty, etc., and the physical basis, according as it is said:
"The prenascent eye base \[is a condition, as dissociation condition,\]
for eye-consciousness ... The body base is a condition, as dissociation
condition, for body-consciousness. The physical basis \[is a condition,
as dissociation condition,\] for resultant- indeterminate and
functional-indeterminate aggregates ... The physical basis \[is a
condition, as dissociation condition,\] for profitable aggregates ...
The physical basis \[is a condition, as dissociation condition,\] for
unprofitable aggregates" (Paṭṭh I 176--77).



[96.](21) A state that, by means of existingness characterized
by presence, assists a like state by consolidating it, is a *presence
condition*. A sevenfold summary is laid down for it according to
immaterial aggregates, great primaries, mentality- materiality,
consciousness and consciousness-concomitants, great primaries, bases,
and physical \[heart\] basis, according as it is said: "The four
immaterial aggregates are a condition, as presence condition, for each
other. The four great primaries ... are ... for each other. At the time
of descent into the womb mentality and materiality \[are a condition, as
presence condition,\] for each other. States of consciousness and
consciousness-concomitants are ... for the kinds of materiality
originated by consciousness. The four great primaries are ... for
derived materiality. The eye base is ... for the eye-consciousness
element \[and for the states associated therewith\]. The \[ear base ...
nose base ... tongue base ...\] body base is ... for the
body-consciousness element ... The visible-data base \[is ... for the
eye-consciousness element ... The sound base ... odour base ... flavour
base ...\] tangible-data base is a condition, as presence condition, for
the body- consciousness element and for the states associated therewith.
The visible-data base ... The \[sound base ... odour base ... flavour
base ...\] tangible-data base is a condition, as presence condition, for
the mind element and for the states associated therewith. The
materiality with which as their support the mind element and
mind-consciousness element occur is a condition, as presence condition,
for the mind element, for the mind-consciousness element, and for the
states associated therewith" (Paṭṭh I 6).



[]



[]



[97.] But in the Question Section, after setting forth
conascence, prenascence, postnascence, nutriment, and faculty, the
description is given first under conascence in the way beginning, "One
aggregate is a condition, as presence condition, for three aggregates
and for materiality originated thereby" (Paṭṭh I 178). Under prenascence
the description is given according to the prenascent eye and so on.
Under postnascence the description is given according to postnascent
consciousness and consciousness-concomitants as conditions for this
body. Under nutriments and faculties \[respectively\] the description is
given thus: "Physical nutriment is a condition, as presence condition,
for this body," \[541\] and "The material life faculty is a condition,
as presence condition, for materiality due to kamma performed" (Paṭṭh I
178).16



[98.](22) Immaterial states that, by their ceasing in
contiguity \[before\], assist by giving opportunity to immaterial states
that arise proximately (next) after them are  *absence conditions*,
according as it is said: "States of consciousness and
consciousness-concomitants that have ceased in contiguity are a
condition, as absence condition, for present states of consciousness and
consciousness- concomitants" (Paṭṭh I 7).



[99.] (23) Those same states, because they assist by their
disappearance, are a *disappearance condition*, according as it is said:
"States of consciousness and consciousness-concomitants that have
disappeared in contiguity are a condition, as disappearance condition,
for present states of consciousness and consciousness-concomitants"
(Paṭṭh I 7).



[100.] (24) The same states that are presence condition,
because they assist by their non-disappearance, should be understood as
a *non-disappearance condition*. Or this dyad is stated as an
embellishment of teaching to suit the needs of those who are teachable,
just as \[in the Mātikā of the Dhammasaṅgaṇī\] the "dissociated-
from-cause dyad" is given after the "causeless dyad."



16\. "The presence (*atthi*)* * condition is not applicable to Nibbāna.
For a presence condition is that which is unhelpful by its absence of
existingness (*atthi*-*bhāvābhāva*) and becomes helpful by obtaining
existingness. And Nibbāna does not, after being unhelpful by its own
absence of existingness to those states that have Nibbāna as their
object, become helpful to them by obtaining existingness. Or
alternatively, the presence condition, which by its non-existingness is
the opposite of helpfulness to those states that are associated with
arising, etc., is helpful to them by its existingness. So Nibbāna is not
a presence condition" (Vism-mhṭ 597).\
It may be noted that *atthi* has more than one use, among which the
following two may be mentioned: (1) *atthi* (is) = *upalabbhaniya* (is
(a) "apprehendable," and (b) not a\
self-contradictory impossibility)---"*atthi, bhikkhave, ajātaṃ*---There
is an unborn\' (Ud 80), and the discussion on the existence of Nibbāna
(XVI.67ff.). (2) *Atthi* (is) = *uppanna\
*(arisen)---see  *"Yaṃ, bhikkhave, rūpaṃ jātaṃ pātubhūtaṃ atthī ti tassa
saṅkhā*---Of the materiality that is born, manifested, it is said that
'It is'" (S II 71f.). The *atthi-paccaya* (presence condition), being
implicitly equated with the latter, cannot be applied to Nibbāna because
Nibbāna is not subject to arising (A I 152).

\[How Ignorance is a Condition for Formations\]



[101.] Now, as regards these twenty-four conditions:



For those of merit ignorance\
Is a condition in two ways\
And for the next in many ways\
But for the last kind only once.



[102.] Herein, *for those of merit ignorance is a condition in
two ways*: it is a condition in two ways, namely, as object condition
and as decisive-support condition. For ignorance is a condition, as
object condition, for formations of merit of the sense sphere at the
time of comprehending \[by means of insight\] ignorance as liable to
destruction and fall; and it is likewise for those of the fine-material
sphere at the time of knowing a confused mind by means of
direct-knowledge consciousness \[through penetrating others' minds, and
so on\]. But it is a condition, as decisive- support condition, in two
cases, that is to say, \[for the sense-sphere formation\] in one who,
for the purpose of surmounting ignorance, fulfils the various instances
of sense-sphere merit-making consisting in giving, etc., and \[for the
fine-material- sphere formation\] in one who arouses the fine-material
jhānas \[for the same purpose\]. Likewise in one who effects that merit
while aspiring to the delight of sense-sphere becoming and fine-material
becoming because he is confused by ignorance.



[103.] *And for the next in many ways*: it is a condition for
formations of demerit in many ways. How? As object condition at the time
of the arising of greed, etc., contingent upon ignorance; as
object-predominance and object-decisive-support respectively at the
times of giving importance \[to ignorance\] and enjoying \[it\]; as
decisive-support in one who, being confused by ignorance and unaware of
danger, kills living things, etc.; as proximity, contiguity,
proximity-decisive- support, repetition, absence, and disappearance, for
the second impulsion and those that follow; as root-cause, conascence,
mutuality, support, association, presence, and non-disappearance, in one
doing anything unprofitable. It is thus a condition in many ways.



[104.] *But for the last kind only once:* \[542\] it is
reckoned as a condition in one way, namely, as decisive-support
condition only, for formations of the imperturbable. But its relation as
decisive-support condition should be understood as stated under
formations of merit.



\[No Single Fruit from Single Cause\]



[105.]*Here it may be asked*: But how is this? Is ignorance the
only condition for formations, or are there other conditions? What is
the position here? For firstly, if it is the only one, there follows the
assertion of a single cause;17 but then if there are others, the
description of it as a single cause, namely, "With ignorance as



17\. "The assertion of a single cause (*kāraṇa*) is undesirable because
it follows that there would be production of everything all the time,
and because it follows that there would be a single homogeneous state;"
(Vism-mhṭ 599) cf. XIX.3.



[]



[]



condition there are formations," is incorrect---It is not incorrect. Why
not? Here is the reason:



Nor from a single cause arise\
One fruit or many, nor one fruit from many;\
'Tis helpful, though, to utilize\
One cause and fruit as representative.



[106.] Here there is no single or multiple fruit of any kind
from a single cause, nor a single fruit from multiple causes, but only
multiple fruit from multiple causes. So from multiple causes, in other
words, from temperature, earth, seed, and moisture, is seen to arise a
multiple fruit, in other words, the shoot, which has visible form,
odour, taste, and so on. But one representative cause and fruit given in
this way, "With ignorance as condition there are formations; with
formations as condition, consciousness," have a meaning and a use.



[107.] For the Blessed One employs one representative cause and
fruit when it is suitable for the sake of elegance in instruction and to
suit the idiosyncrasies of those susceptible of being taught. And he
does so in some instances because it is a basic factor, and in some
instances because it is the most obvious, and in some instances because
it is not common to all.



In the passage "With contact as condition, feeling" (M I 261) he
mentions a single cause and fruit because they are basic factors. For
contact is the basic cause of feeling since the kinds of feeling are
defined according to the kinds of contact \[as "eye-contact-born
feeling" and so on\], and feeling is contact's basic fruit since contact
is defined according to the kinds of feeling \[that it produces\]. He
mentions a single cause in the passage "Disease due to phlegm" (A V 110)
because that is the most obvious. For here what is obvious is the
phlegm, not the kamma, etc., \[mentioned later in the same sutta\]. He
mentions a single cause in the passage "Bhikkhus, any states whatever
that are unprofitable are all rooted in unwise attention" (cf. S V 91)
because it is not common to all. For unwise attention to unprofitable
things is not common to all \[states\] in the way that, say, physical
basis and object are common to all.



[108.] Consequently, although other causes of formations such
as physical basis and object, conascent states, etc., are actually
existent, still ignorance may be understood as the representative cause
of formations \[firstly\] because it is the basic factor as the cause of
other causes of formations such as craving, etc., as it is said:
"Craving increases in one who dwells seeing enjoyment" (S II 84), and
"With the arising of ignorance there is the arising of cankers" (M I
55); and again because it is the most obvious, "Not knowing, bhikkhus,
in ignorance, he forms the formation of merit" (cf. S II 82); and lastly
because it is not common to all. \[543\] So the use of one
representative cause and fruit should in each instance be understood
according to this explanation of it.18



[109.] Here it may be said: "We admit that. But ignorance is
reprehensible and has entirely undesirable fruit. How then can it
rightly be a condition for formations of merit and of the imperturbable?
Sugarcane does not grow from \[bitter\] nimba



[18.]*Parihāra*-*vacana---*"explanation": not in PED in this
sense.



[]



[]



seeds." Why should it not be right? For in the world \[that is, even
among thinkers outside the Dispensation it is recognized that\]



Both as opposed and unopposed\
A state's conditions may be found,\
And both as like and unlike too:\
That does not make it their *result*.



[110.] It is established in the world that when states have a
condition, it may be opposed or unopposed to them as to presence,
individual essence, function, and so on. For a preceding consciousness
is a condition, opposed as to presence, for the succeeding
consciousness; and the preceding training is a condition likewise for
the plying of crafts, etc., which take place subsequently. Kamma is a
condition, opposed as to individual essence, for materiality; and so are
milk, etc., for curds, and so on. Light is a condition, opposed as to
function, for eye-consciousness; and so are molasses, etc., for
intoxicants, and so on. But eye-cum-visible-data, etc., are respectively
a condition, unopposed as to presence, for eye-consciousness, and so on.
And the first impulsion, and those that follow, are a condition,
unopposed as to individual essence and function, for the impulsions that
follow them. And just as conditions operate as opposed and unopposed, so
also they operate as like and unlike. Materiality---for example,
temperature and nutriment---is a condition for materiality: the like for
the like. And so are paddy seeds, etc., for paddy crops, and so on. The
material is a condition for the immaterial, and so is the immaterial for
the material: the unlike for the like. And so are ox hair and ram's
hair, horns, curd, and sesame flour, etc., respectively for *dabba*
grass, reeds, *bhūtanaka* grass, and so on.19 And those states for which
these are the opposed and unopposed, like and unlike, conditions are not
the results of these states as well.



[111.] So although this ignorance has entirely undesirable
fruit for its result and is reprehensible in its individual essence, yet
it should be understood as a condition, opposed or unopposed and like or
unlike as the case may be, as to presence, function, and individual
essence, for all these formations of merit, etc. And its state as a
condition has already been given in the way beginning, "For when
unknowing---in other words, ignorance---of suffering, etc., is unaban-
doned in a man, owing firstly to his unknowing about suffering and about
the past, etc., then be believes the suffering of the round of rebirths
to be pleasant



19\. *Avi---*"a goat or sheep": not in PED. The Vism text reads
"*golomāvilomavisāṇa*- *dadhitilapiṭṭhādīni ca
dubbāsarabhūtanakādīnaṃ*." Vism-mhṭ explains thus: "*Golomāvilomādī ti
ādisu golomāvilomāni dubbāya avī ti rattā eḷakā veditabbā visāṇaṃ
sarassa dadhitilapiṭṭhagūlāni bhūtiṇakassa sevālaṃ taṇḍuleyyakassa
kharavalavā assatarassā ti evam ādi ādisaddena saṅgahito*," which
renders thus: "As to '*Ox hair and ram's hair, etc.*,' and the rest: ox
hair and ram's hair \[are conditions for the unlike\] *dubbā* (*dabba*)
grass---a ram (*avi*) should be understood as a red sheep (*eḷakā*);
horn is for reeds (*sara*); curds, sesame flour and molasses are for
*bhūtiṇaka* grass; moss is for the *taṇḍuleyyaka* plant; a she donkey is
for a mule; and so on in this way as included by the word 'etc.'"
(Vism-mhṭ 601). Except for the last-mentioned, it seems problematical
why these things, if rightly interpreted, should be conditions for the
things mentioned.



[]



[]



and he embarks upon the three kinds of formations, which are the cause
of that very suffering" (§62).



[112.] Moreover, there is this way of explanation as well:



Now, when a man is ignorant\
Of death and rebirth and the round,\
The characteristics of the formed,\
Dependently-arisen states, \[544\]



And in his ignorance he forms\
Formations of this triple kind,\
Then ignorance itself will be\
Condition for each of the three.



[113.] But how does a man who is confused about these things
perform these three kinds of formations? Firstly, when he is confused
about death, instead of taking death thus, "Death in every case is
break-up of aggregates," he figures that it is a \[lasting\] being that
dies, that it is a \[lasting\] being's transmigration to another
incarnation, and so on.



[114.] When he is confused about reappearance, instead of
taking rebirth thus, "Birth in every case is manifestation of
aggregates," he figures that it is a lasting being's manifestation in a
new body.



[115.] When he is confused about the round of rebirths, instead
of taking the round of rebirths as pictured thus:



The endless chain of aggregates,\
Of elements, of bases too,\
That carries on unbrokenly\
Is what is called "the round of births,"



he figures that it is a lasting being that goes from this world to
another world,



that comes from another world to this world.



[116.] When he is confused about the characteristics of
formations, instead of apprehending their specific and general
characteristics, he figures that formations are self, belong to a self,
are lasting, pleasant, beautiful.



[117.] When he is confused about dependently-arisen states,
instead of taking the occurrence of formations to be due to ignorance,
etc., he figures that it is a self that knows or does not know, that
acts and causes action, that appears in rebirth- linking, and he figures
that atoms, an Overlord, etc., shape its body in the various states of
the embryo and endow it with faculties, and that when it has been
endowed with faculties it touches, feels, craves, clings, and
endeavours, and that it becomes anew in the next becoming; or he figures
thus, "All beings ... \[are\] moulded by fate, coincidence and nature"
(D I 53).



[118.] Thus he figures, blinded by ignorance. He is like a
blind man who wanders about the earth, encountering now right and now
wrong paths, now heights and now hollows, now even and now uneven
ground, and so he forms formations now of merit, now of demerit, now
imperturbable.



[119.] Hence this is said:



[]



[]



As one born blind, who gropes along\
Without assistance from a guide,\
Chooses a road that may be right\
At one time, at another wrong,



So while the foolish man pursues\
The round of births without a guide,\
Now to do merit he may choose\
And now demerit in such plight.



But when the Dhamma he comes to know\
And penetrates the truths besides,\
Then ignorance is put to flight\
At last, and he in peace may go.



This is the detailed explanation of the clause, "With ignorance as
condition



there are formations." \[545\]



\[(III) CONSCIOUSNESS\]



\[(1) Kinds of Mundane Resultant Consciousness\]



[120.] In the clause, *with formations as condition,
consciousness*, consciousness is sixfold as eye-consciousness, and so
on. Herein, eye-consciousness is twofold, namely, profitable
\[kamma-\]resultant and unprofitable \[kamma-\]resultant (see Table II
for bracketed numbers that follow). Likewise ear-, nose-, tongue-, and
body-consciousness ((34)--(38) and (50)--(54)). But mind-consciousness
is twenty- two-fold, namely, the two profitable and unprofitable
resultant mind elements ((39) and (55)), the three root-causeless
mind-consciousness elements ((40), (41) and (56)), the eight
sense-sphere resultant consciousnesses with root-cause ((42)--(49)), the
five of the fine-material sphere ((57)--(61)), and the four of the
immaterial sphere ((62)--(65)). So all the thirty-two mundane resultant
consciousnesses ((34)--(65)) are included by these six kinds of
consciousness. But the supramundane kinds do not belong to the
exposition of the round \[of becoming\], and so they are not included.



[121.] Here it may be asked: "But how is it to be known that
this consciousness of the kind stated actually has formations as its
condition?"---Because there is no kamma-result when there is no
stored-up kamma. For this consciousness is kamma-result, and
kamma-result does not arise in the absence of stored-up kamma. If it
did, then all kinds of kamma-resultant consciousnesses would arise in
all kinds of beings, and they do not do so. This is how it should be
known that such consciousness has formations as its condition.



[122.] But which kind of consciousness has which kind of
formations as its condition?



Firstly, the following sixteen kinds arise with the sense-sphere
formation of merit as condition: the five profitable resultants
beginning with eye- consciousness ((34)--(38)), and in the case of
mind-consciousness one kind of mind element (39) and two kinds of
mind-consciousness element ((40)--(41)),



[]



[]



and the eight kinds of sense-sphere resultant ((42)--(49)), according as
it is said: "Owing to profitable kamma of the sense sphere having been
performed, stored up, resultant eye-consciousness" (Dhs §431), "ear-,
nose-, tongue-, body- consciousness" (Dhs §443), "resultant mind element
arises" (Dhs §455), "mind- consciousness element accompanied by joy
arises" (Dhs §469), "mind- consciousness element accompanied by
equanimity arises" (Dhs §484), "accompanied by joy and associated with
knowledge ... accompanied by joy, associated with knowledge and prompted
... accompanied by joy and dissociated from knowledge ... accompanied by
joy, dissociated from knowledge and prompted ... accompanied by
equanimity and associated with knowledge ... accompanied by equanimity,
associated with knowledge and prompted ... accompanied by equanimity and
dissociated from knowledge ... accompanied by equanimity, dissociated
from knowledge and prompted" (Dhs §498).



[123.] There are five kinds of resultant fine-material-sphere
consciousness ((57)-- (61)) with the fine-material-sphere formation of
merit as condition, according as it is said: "Owing to that same
profitable kamma of the fine-material sphere having been performed,
stored up, \[by the development of that same profitable jhāna,\] \[546\]
secluded from sense desires ... he enters upon and dwells in the
resultant first jhāna ... fifth jhāna" (Dhs §499).



[124.] There are seven kinds of consciousness with the
formation of demerit as condition: the five unprofitable resultants
beginning with eye-consciousness ((50)--(54)), one mind element (55),
and one mind-consciousness element (56), according as it is said:
"Because of unprofitable kamma having been performed and stored up,
resultant eye-consciousness has arisen ... ear- ... nose- ... tongue-
... body-consciousness has arisen" (Dhs §556), "resultant mind element"
(Dhs §562), "resultant mind-consciousness element has arisen" (Dhs
§564).



[125.]There are four kinds of immaterial resultant
consciousness ((62)--(65)) with the formation of the imperturbable as
condition, according as it is said: "Owing to that same profitable kamma
of the immaterial sphere having been performed, stored up \[by the
development of that same profitable immaterial jhāna, with the
abandoning of bodily pleasure and pain ... he enters upon and dwells in
the resultant fourth jhāna, which,\] with the complete surmounting of
perceptions of material form ... is accompanied by the base consisting
of boundless space" (Dhs §501), "accompanied by the base consisting of
boundless consciousness" (Dhs §502), "accompanied by the base consisting
of nothingness" (Dhs §503), "accompanied by the base consisting of
neither perception nor non-perception" (Dhs §504).



[126.] After knowing what kind of consciousness has what
formations as its



condition, one should now understand how it occurs as follows.



\[(2) The Occurrence of Resultant Consciousness\]



Now, this resultant consciousness all occurs in two ways, namely, (a) in
the course of an individual existence (or continuity), and (b) at the
rebirth-linking \[moment\].



Herein, there are the two fivefold consciousnesses ((34)--(38) and
(50)--(54)),



two mind elements ((39) and (55)), and root-causeless mind-consciousness

[]



element accompanied by joy (40), that is, thirteen which occur only in
the course of an existence in the five-constituent kind of becoming.20
The remaining nineteen occur in the three kinds of becoming, either in
the course of an existence or at rebirth-linking, as appropriate. How?



\[2. (a) In the Course of an Existence\]



[127.] Firstly, in one who has been reborn by means of either
profitable-result or unprofitable result: according as his faculties
mature, so the five profitable- resultant eye-, etc., consciousnesses
occur accomplishing the respective functions of *seeing, hearing,
smelling, tasting, and touching* ((d)--(h)), contingent respectively
upon a desirable or desirable-neutral visible datum, etc., as object
that has come into the focus of the eye, etc., and having the
sensitivity of the eye, etc., as \[material\] support. And likewise the
five unprofitable-resultant consciousnesses; the only difference being
this, that the visible data, etc., as object for these are undesirable
or undesirable-neutral. And these ten are invariable as to their door,
object, physical basis, and position \[in the cognitive series\], and
invariable as to their functions.



[128.] After that, next to the profitable-resultant eye-, etc.,
consciousness, the profitable-resultant mind element (39) occurs
accomplishing the function of *receiving* (i), contingent upon the same
object as that of the former, and having the heart-basis as support.
\[547\] And next after the unprofitable-resultant eye-, etc.,
consciousness, the unprofitable-resultant mind element (55) occurs
likewise. But these two, while variable as to door and object, are
invariable as to physical basis and position, and invariable as to
function.



[129.] Then next to the profitable-resultant mind element, the
root-causeless mind-consciousness element accompanied by joy (40) occurs
accomplishing the function of *investigation* (j), contingent upon the
same object as that of the mind element, and having the heart-basis as
support. And when the object is a vivid one in any of the six doors
belonging to sense-sphere beings, usually at the end of impulsions
associated with greed it holds up the \[renewal of the\] course of the
life-continuum (b) by occurring either once or twice as *registration*
(m), having the same object as that apprehended by the impulsions---so
it is said in the Majjhima Commentary.21 But in the Abhidhamma
Commentary two turns of consciousness have been handed down with respect
to registration. This consciousness has two names, "registration"
(*tad*-*ārammaṇa---*lit. *having that object* that the preceding
impulsions had) and "aftermath life-continuum" (*piṭṭhi*-
*bhavaṅga---*see XIV.122). It is variable as to door and object, it is
invariable as to physical basis, and it is variable as to position and
function.



20\. For five-constituent becoming, etc., see §§253--54. "Unprofitable
resultant eye- consciousness, etc. sometimes arise even in Brahmās when
undesirable visible data, etc., come into focus" (Vism-mhṭ 604); cf.
§180.\



21\. This refers to the old Sinhalese commentary no longer extant.



[]



[]



This, in the first place, it should be understood, is how thirteen kinds
of consciousness occur only in the course of an individual existence in
the five- constituent kind of becoming.



[130.] As to the remaining nineteen ((41)--(49) and
(56)--(65)), there is none that does not occur as a rebirth-linking (a)
appropriate to it (see §133). But in the course of an individual
existence, firstly, two, namely, profitable-resultant and
unprofitable-resultant root-causeless mind-consciousness elements ((41)
and (56)) occur accomplishing four functions, that is to say, the
function of *investigating* in the five doors (j) next after
profitable-resultant and unprofitable-resultant mind element, the
function of *registration* (m) in the six doors in the way already
stated, the function of *life-continuum* (b) that continues after
rebirth-linking given by themselves, as long as there is no
thought-arising to interrupt the life- continuum, and lastly the
function of *death* (n) at the end \[of the course of an existence\].
And so these two are invariable as to \[possession of heart-\] basis,
and variable as to door, object, position, and function.



[131.] The eight sense-sphere consciousnesses with root-cause
((42)--(49)) occur accomplishing three functions, namely, the function
of *registration* (m) in the six doors in the way already stated, the
function of *life-continuum* (b) after rebirth- linking given by
themselves, as long as there is no thought-arising to interrupt the
life-continuum, and lastly the function of death (n) at the end. And
they are invariable as to \[possession of heart-\] basis, and variable
as to door, position, and function.



[132.] The five fine-material consciousnesses ((57)--(61)) and
the four immaterial consciousnesses ((62)--(65)) occur accomplishing two
functions, namely, the function of *life-continuum* (b) that continues
after rebirth-linking given by themselves, as long as there is no
thought-arising to interrupt the life-continuum, and the function of
*death* (n) at the end. As regards these, those of the fine- material
sphere are invariable as to \[possession of heart-\]basis and as to
their object, and they are variable as to position and function, while
the others occur invariably without \[heart-\] basis, and they are
invariable as to object, and variable as to position and function.



This, in the first place, is how the thirty-twofold resultant
consciousness occurs in the course of an individual existence with
formations as condition. And there \[in the course of an existence\]
these several formations are conditions, as kamma condition and
decisive-support condition, for this \[thirty-twofold resultant
consciousness\]. \[548\]



\[2. (b) At Rebirth-Linking\]



[133.] But what was said above, namely, "as to the remaining
nineteen, there is none that does not occur as a rebirth-linking
appropriate to it" (§130), is hard to understand since it is too brief.
Hence, in order to show the details it may be asked: (i) How many kinds
of rebirth-linking are there? (ii) How many kinds of rebirth- linking
consciousness? (iii) Where and by what means does rebirth-linking come
about? (iv) What does rebirth-linking \[consciousness\] have as its
object?



[]



[]



[134.] (i) Including the rebirth-linking of non-percipient
beings there are twenty kinds of rebirth-linking.



[(ii)] There are nineteen kinds of rebirth-linking
consciousnesses, as already



described.



[(iii)] Herein, rebirth-linking by means of the
unprofitable-resultant root- causeless mind-consciousness element (56)
comes about in the states of loss. Rebirth-linking by means of the
profitable-resultant (41) comes about in the human world among those
blind from birth, born deaf, born mad, born drivelling (see M I 20; M-a
I 118), the sexless, and so on. Rebirth-linking by means of the eight
principal resultant consciousnesses with root-cause ((42)--(49)) comes
about among deities of the sense sphere and the meritorious among men.
That by means of the five fine-material resultant kinds comes about in
the fine-material Brahmā-world. That by means of the four
immaterial-sphere resultant kinds comes about in the immaterial world.
So rebirth-linking \[consciousness\] conforms to the means by which, and
the place in which, it comes about.



[(iv)] Briefly, rebirth-linking \[consciousness\] has three
kinds of objects, namely, past, present, and not-so-classifiable (see
Ch. III, n. 32). Non-percipient rebirth- linking \[consciousness\] has
no object.



[135.] Herein, in the base consisting of boundless
consciousness and the base consisting of neither perception nor
non-perception, the object of rebirth-linking is  *past*. That of the
ten kinds of sense-sphere rebirth-linking is *past* or *present*. That
of the rest is *not-so-classifiable*. But while the rebirth-linking
consciousness occurs thus with three kinds of objects, the death
consciousness, next to which it occurs, has only a past or a
not-so-classifiable object, there being no death consciousness with a
present object. Consequently, it should be understood how it occurs in
the happy destinies and the unhappy destinies as follows, that is to
say, how rebirth-linking consciousness with one of three kinds of
objects occurs next to death consciousness with one of two kinds of
objects.



[136.]\[*From happy to unhappy destiny*.\] For example, firstly
in the case of a person in the happy destinies of the sense-sphere who
is an evildoer, when he is lying on his deathbed, his evil kamma
according as it has been stored up, or its sign, comes into focus in the
mind door. For it is said, "Then \[the evil deeds that he did in the
past\] ... cover him \[and overspread him and envelop him\]" (M III
164), and so on. Then next to the cognitive series of impulsions ending
in registration22 that arose contingent upon that \[kamma or its sign\],
death consciousness arises making the life-continuum's objective field
its object. When it has ceased, rebirth- linking consciousness arises
contingent upon that same kamma or kamma sign that had come into focus,
and it does so located in the unhappy destiny, being driven there by the
force of defilements that have not been cut off. \[549\] This is the
kind of rebirth-linking that has a *past* object and comes next to death
consciousness with a *past* object.



[22.]Vibh-a (Be) adds "*suddhāya va javanavīthiyā*" here, as in
§140 below in all texts.



[]



[]



[137.]In another's case, owing to kamma of the kind already
described, there comes into focus at the mind door at the time of death
the sign of the unhappy destinies with the appearance of fire and
flames, etc., in the hells, and so on.23 So when the life-continuum has
twice arisen and ceased, three sorts of cognitive- series consciousness
arise contingent upon that object, namely, the one adverting, impulsions
numbering five because of the slowing down due to the nearness of death,
and two registrations. After that, one death consciousness arises making
the life-continuum's objective field its object. At this point eleven
consciousnesses have elapsed. Then, having that same object, which has a
life span of the remaining five conscious moments, his rebirth-linking
consciousness arises. This is the kind of rebirth-linking that has a
*present* object and comes next to death with a *past* object.



[138.] In another's case, at the time of death there comes into
focus in one of the five doors an inferior object that is a cause of
greed, and so on. When a series of consciousnesses up to determining
have arisen in due succession, there arise impulsions numbering five
because of slowing down due to the nearness of death, and two
registrations. After that, one death consciousness arises making the
life-continuum's objective field its object. At this point fifteen
consciousnesses have elapsed, namely, two life-continuums, one each
adverting, seeing, receiving, investigating and determining, five
impulsions, two registrations, and one death consciousness. Then, having
that same object, which has a life span of the remaining one conscious
moment, his rebirth-linking consciousness arises. This also is the kind
of rebirth-linking that has a *present* object and comes next to a death
consciousness with a *past* object.



This, firstly, is how rebirth-linking in an unhappy destiny with *past*
and *present*



objects occurs next to death consciousness in a happy destiny with a
past object.



[139.]\[*From unhappy to happy destiny*.\] In the case of one
in an unhappy destiny who has stored up blameless kamma all should be
understood in the same way, substituting the bright for the dark side
thus: His good kamma, \[according as it has been stored up\], or its
sign, comes into focus in the mind door \[and continuing\] in the way
already stated.



This is how rebirth-linking occurs in a happy destiny with *past* and
*present*



objects next to death consciousness in an unhappy destiny with a *past*
object.



[140.]\[*From happy to happy destiny*.\] In the case of one in
a happy destiny who has stored up blameless kamma, when he is lying on
his death-bed, his blameless kamma according as it has been stored up,
or its sign, comes into focus in the mind door. For it is said, "Then
\[the good deeds he did in the past\] ... cover him \[and overspread him
and envelop him\]" (M III 171), and so on. And that applies only in the
case of one who has stored up blameless sense-sphere kamma. \[550\] But
in the case of one who has stored up kamma of the exalted spheres only
the sign of the kamma comes into focus. Then next to the cognitive
series of



23\. "'*With the appearance of fire and flames, etc., in the hells*' is
said owing to likeness to that; appearance of hell and fire does not
itself come into focus for him then" (Vism-mhṭ 607).



[]



[]



impulsions ending in registration, or of simple impulsions, that arose
contingent upon that \[kamma or its sign\], death consciousness arises
making the life- continuum's objective field its object. When it has
ceased, rebirth-linking consciousness arises contingent upon that same
kamma or sign of kamma that had come into focus, and it does so located
in the happy destiny, being driven there by the force of defilements
that have not been cut off. This is the kind of rebirth-linking that has
a *past* or a *not-so-classifiable* object and comes next to death
consciousness with a past object.



[141.]In another's case, owing to blameless sense-sphere kamma,
there comes into focus in the mind door at the time of death the sign of
a happy destiny, in other words, the appearance of the mother's womb24
in the case of the human world or the appearance of pleasure groves,
divine palaces, wishing trees, etc., in the case of the divine world.
His rebirth-linking consciousness arises next to the death consciousness
in the order shown for the sign of an unhappy destiny. This is the kind
of rebirth-linking that has a *present* object and comes next to death
consciousness with a *past* object.



[142.] In another's case, relatives present \[objects to him\]
at the five sense doors, such as a visible datum as object, perhaps
flowers, garlands, flags, banners, etc., saying, "This is being offered
to the Blessed One for your sake, dear, set your mind at rest"; or a
sound as object, perhaps, preaching of the Dhamma, offerings of music,
etc.; or an odour as object, perhaps incense, scents, perfumes, etc.; or
a taste as object, perhaps honey, molasses, etc., saying, "Taste this,
dear, it is a gift to be given for your sake"; or a tangible datum as
object, perhaps Chinese silk, silk of Somāra, saying, "Touch this, dear,
it is a gift to be given for your sake." Now, when that visible datum,
or whatever it may be, as object has come into focus for him and the
consciousnesses ending in determining have arisen in due succession,
there arise in him impulsions numbering five because of slowing down due
to the nearness of death, and two registrations; after that, one death
consciousness, making the life-continuum's objective field its object.
At the end of that, having that same object, which lasts only a single
conscious moment, rebirth-linking consciousness arises. This also is the
kind of rebirth-linking with a *present* object and comes next to a
death consciousness with a *past* object.



[143.] But in the case of another who is in a happy destiny and
has obtained



exalted \[consciousness\] through earth-kasiṇa jhāna, etc., at the time
of his death



24\. The *Sammohavinodanī* adds more details here: "When hell appears it
does so like a metal cauldron; when the human world appears, the
mother's womb appears like a woollen slipper (*kambala*-*yāna---*for
*yāna* as footwear or sandals see M-a III 222); when the heavenly world
appears, wishing trees, divine palaces and couches, etc., appear."
Vism-mhṭ remarks here: "By the words 'the appearance of the mother\'s
womb,' etc., only visual appearance is given as the sign of destiny.
Herein, in the first place it would be logical that sound has not been
given in the Commentaries as a sign of destiny because it is included in
the happy destinies as not-clung-to, but the reason for odour, etc., not
having been given, will be inquired into" (Vism-mhṭ 609). This question
is in fact dealt with at length at Vism-mhṭ 611, but the arguments are
not reproduced here. See note 26 below.



[]



[]



there comes into focus at the mind door the sense-sphere profitable
kamma or the sign of the kamma or the sign of the destiny, or else the
sign of the earth kasiṇa, etc., or else the exalted consciousness,
\[551\] or else there comes into focus a superior object of the eye or
ear that is a cause for profitable rebirth. When the consciousnesses
ending in determining have arisen in due succession, there arise in him
impulsions numbering five because of slowing down due to the nearness of
death. But in those who belong to an exalted destiny there is no
registration. So the one death consciousness arises next to the
impulsion and making the life-continuum's objective field its object. At
the end of that, rebirth- linking consciousness arises located in one of
the happy destinies of the sense sphere or exalted sphere, and having as
its object whichever one among the aforesaid objects has appeared. This
is the kind of rebirth-linking with a *past*, *present*, or
*not-so-classifiable* object next to death consciousness in a happy
destiny with a *not-so-classifiable object*.



[144.] Rebirth-linking next to immaterial-sphere death should
be understood in this way too. This is how rebirth-linking occurs with a
*past*,  *present*, or *not-so- classifiable* object next to death
consciousness in a happy destiny with a past or *not-so-classifiable*
object.



[145.]\[*From unhappy to unhappy destiny*.\] In the case of one
in an unhappy destiny who is an evil-doer, that kamma, or its sign, or
the sign of the destiny, comes into focus in the mind door, or in the
five doors, as the object that is the cause for the unprofitable
rebirth. Then his rebirth-linking consciousness arises in due succession
at the end of the death consciousness and located in the unhappy destiny
and with one of those objects as its object. This is how rebirth-linking
occurs with a past or present object next to death in an unhappy destiny
with a past object.



\[How Kamma is a Condition\]



[146.]Up to *this* point there has been shown the occurrence of
the nineteenfold consciousness as rebirth-linking. Also all this \[is
further classified; for\]



While it occurs in linking thus,\
It has a double class beside\
Through kamma, and as mixed and not,\
And is still further classified.



[147.] When this nineteenfold kamma-resultant consciousness
occurs thus in rebirth-linking, it does so by means of kamma in two
ways; for according to the way in which the kamma that generates it
occurs, the kamma can be its condition both as kamma condition acting
from a different time and as decisive-support condition, since this is
said: "Profitable ... \[and\] unprofitable kamma is a condition, as
decisive-support condition, for \[its\] result" (Paṭṭh I 167, 169).



[148.] It should be understood that when it occurs thus, its
*double class*, etc., is



*mixed and not*, and it is *still further classified*.



For example: though this \[type of consciousness\] occurs in one way
only as



rebirth-linking, still it is twofold as divided into mixed and unmixed
with



[]



[]



materiality; \[552\] it is threefold as divided according to
sense-desire, fine-material, and immaterial becoming (M I 50); it is
fourfold as egg-born, womb-born, putrescence- (moisture-) born, and of
apparitional generation (M I 73); it is fivefold according to destiny (M
I 73); it is sevenfold according to the stations of consciousness (D III
253), and it is eightfold according to the abodes of beings \[excluding
non-percipient beings\] (see D III 263).



[149.] Herein:



The mixed is double, sexed and not,\
And that with sex is double too;\
The least decads the first has got\
Respectively are three and two.



[150.] *The mixed is double, sexed and not*: that
rebirth-linking consciousness, which, leaving aside the immaterial
becoming, arises here mixed with materiality, is twofold as "with sex"
and "without sex,"25 because it arises in the fine-material sphere
without the sex called femininity faculty and masculinity faculty, and
because---leaving aside the rebirth-linking of one born as a eunuch---it
arises in the sense-sphere becoming together with that \[twofold\] sex.



And that with sex is double too: there also that with sex is twofold
because it



arises in association with either the female or the male sex.



[151.] *The least decads the first has got respectively are
three or two*: together with the rebirth-linking consciousness that is
mixed with materiality and comes first in the pair "mixed and unmixed,"
there arise, at the least, the two decads (see 18.5f.) of physical basis
and body, or else the three decads of physical basis, body, and sex.
There is no reducing the materiality below that.



[152.] But when that minimal amount arises in the two kinds of
generation termed egg-born and womb-born, it amounts to no more than a
drop of cream of ghee on a single fibre of new-born \[kid's\] wool, and
it is known as the "embryo in the first stage" (S I 206).



[153.] Herein, how the different kinds of generation come about
may be



understood according to the kind of destiny. For as regards these:



No first three generations are\
In hell, or with the deities,\
Save those of earth; all four are found\
In the three other destinies.



[154.] Herein, by the words *with deities* it should be
understood that, as in hell and among deities---excepting earth
deities---so also among the ghosts consumed with thirst, the first three
kinds of generation are not found; for they are apparitional only. But
in the remaining three kinds of destiny, in other words, among animals,
ghosts and human beings, and among the earth deities excepted above,
there are all four kinds of generation.



25\. *Sa*-*bhāva* (with sex) and *a*-*bhāva* (without sex) are not to be
confused with *sabhāva* (individual essence) and *abhāva* (absence,
non-existence).



[]



[]



[155.] Now:



The fine material gods have thirty-nine;\
The apparitional and moisture-born\
Have seventy material instances\
At most, and they have thirty at the least.



[156.]Firstly, among the fine-material Brahmās of apparitional
generation there arise together with rebirth-linking consciousness
thirty and also nine material instances \[553\] with the four groups,
namely, the decads of the eye, ear, and physical basis, and the ennead
of life. But leaving the fine-material Brahmās aside, among the others
of apparitional generation and those of the moisture-born generation
there are seventy instances of materiality at the most with the decads
of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, physical basis and sex. And these
are invariably to be found among deities \[of the sense sphere\]. Now,
the group of material states comprising the ten material instances,
namely, colour, odour, flavour, nutritive essence, and the four primary
elements, with eye sensitivity and life, are called the "eye decad." The
remaining \[groups of material states\] should be understood in the same
way.



[157.] At the least, thirty material instances arise with the
decads of the tongue, body, and physical basis, in those who are blind
from birth, deaf, noseless,26 and sexless. Between the most and the
least, the allotment should be understood according as appropriate.



[158.] After knowing this, again:



One ought to consider the \[pair\] death and birth\
Under aggregates, object, cause, destiny, feeling,\
Happiness, and then thinking applied and sustained,\
Distinguishing them by unlikeness and likeness.



[159.] The meaning is this: there is rebirth-linking that is
twofold as mixed and unmixed \[with materiality\], and there is the
death consciousness next before it, and their unlikeness and likeness
according to these aggregates, etc., must be known. How?



[160.] Sometimes, next to a four-aggregate immaterial death
there is a four- aggregate rebirth-linking having a like object;
sometimes there is an exalted rebirth-linking with an internal object
next to an unexalted death with an external object. This, firstly, is
the method in the case of the immaterial planes.



Sometimes there is a five-aggregate sense-sphere rebirth-linking next to
a four- aggregate immaterial death. Sometimes there is a four-aggregate
immaterial rebirth- linking next to a five-aggregate sense-sphere death
or fine-material-sphere death.



Thus there is rebirth-linking with a *present* object27 next to a death
with a *past*



object, there is rebirth-linking in a certain unhappy destiny next to
death in a



26\. Vism-mhṭ (p. 611) has a long discussion here of the difficulty of
speaking of the Brahmā-world (where there are only the senses of seeing
and hearing) in terms of the decads, which contain the components of
odour and flavour. (§156) It ends by defending the *Visuddhimagga*
standpoint.\



27\. *Sammohavinodanī* (Be) has "rebirth-linking with a past, not
so-classifiable, and present object next to" and so on.



[]



[]



certain happy destiny, there is rebirth-linking with root-cause next to
root- causeless death, there is triple-root-cause rebirth-linking next
to double-root- cause death, there is rebirth-linking accompanied by joy
next to death accompanied by equanimity, there is rebirth-linking with
happiness next to death without happiness, there is rebirth-linking with
applied thought next to death without applied thought, there is
rebirth-linking with sustained thought next to death without sustained
thought, there is rebirth-linking with applied and sustained thought
next to death without applied and sustained thought.



In this way they can be coupled together by opposites as appropriate.



[161.] A mere state that has got its conditions Ushers in the
ensuing existence;\
While it does not migrate from the past,\
With no cause in the past it is not.



[162.] So it is a mere material and immaterial state, arising
when it has obtained its conditions, that is spoken of, saying that it
comes into the next becoming; it is not a lasting being, \[554\] not a
soul. And it has neither transmigrated from the past becoming nor yet is
it manifested here without cause from that.



[163.] We shall explain this by the normal process of human
death and rebirth- linking. When in the past becoming a man near to a
natural or violent death is unable to bear the onset of the unbearable
daggers of the \[painful\] feelings that end in death as they sever the
ligatures of the joints in all the limbs, his body gradually withers
like a green palm leaf lying in the glare of the sun, and when the
faculties of the eye, etc., have ceased and the body faculty, mind
faculty, and life faculty remain on in the heart-basis alone, then
consciousness, which has as its support the heart-basis still remaining
at that moment, either occurs contingent upon some kamma classed as
"weighty," "repeated," performed "near" \[to death\] or previously,28 in
other words, the formation that has obtained the remaining conditions,
or contingent upon the objective field made to appear by that kamma, in
other words, the sign of the kamma or sign of the destiny.29 And while
it is occurring thus, because craving and ignorance have not been
abandoned, craving pushes it and the conascent formations fling it
forward30



28\. See the classification of kamma at XIX.74ff. "Repeated"
(*samāsevita*) kamma is not mentioned there as such. Of "near" kamma
Vism-mhṭ says, "It is that performed next to death, or which is
conspicuous in the memory then, whenever it was performed" (Vism-mhṭ
617).\



29\. "'*Sign of the kamma*' is the event (*vatthu*) by means of which a
man accumulates kamma through making it the object at the time of
accumulation. Even if the kamma was performed as much as a hundred
thousand eons ago, nevertheless at the time of its ripening it appears
as kamma or sign of kamma. The '*sign of the destiny*' is one of the
visual scenes in the place where rebirth is due to take place. It
consists in the visual appearance of flames of fire, etc., to one ready
to be reborn in hell, and so on as already stated" (Vism-mhṭ 617).\



30\. "Owing to craving being unabandoned, and because the
previously-arisen continuity is similarly deflected, consciousness
occurs inclining, leaning and tending



[]



[]



on to that objective field, the dangers in which are concealed by
ignorance. And while, as a continuous process,31 it is being pushed by
craving and flung forward by formations, it abandons its former support,
like a man who crosses a river by hanging on to a rope tied to a tree on
the near bank, and, whether or not it gets a further support originated
by kamma, it occurs by means of the conditions consisting only in object
condition, and so on.



[164.] The former of these \[two states of consciousness\] is
called "death" (*cuti*) because of falling (*cavana*), and the latter is
called "rebirth-linking" (*paṭisandhi*) because of linking
(*paṭisandhāna*) across the gap separating the beginning of the next
becoming. But it should be understood that it has neither come here from
the previous becoming nor has it become manifest without the kamma, the
formations, the pushing, the objective field, etc., as cause.



[165.] An echo, or its like, supplies The figures here;
connectedness\
By continuity denies\
Identity and otherness.



[166.] And here let the illustration of this consciousness be
such things as an echo, a light, a seal impression, a looking-glass
image, for the fact of its not coming here from the previous becoming
and for the fact that it arises owing to causes that are included in
past becomings. For just as an echo, a light, a seal impression, and a
shadow have respectively sound, etc., as their cause and come into being
without going elsewhere, so also this consciousness.



[167.]And with a stream of continuity there is neither identity
nor otherness. For if there were absolute identity in a stream of
continuity, there would be no forming of curd from milk. And yet if
there were absolute otherness, the curd would not be derived from the
milk. And so too with all causally arisen things. And if that were so
there would be an end to all worldly usage, which is hardly desirable.
So neither absolute identity nor absolute otherness should be assumed
here. \[555\]



[168.] Here it might be asked: "If no transmigration is
manifested, then after the cessation of the aggregates in this human
person, that fruit could be another person's or due to other \[kamma\],
since the kamma that is the condition for the fruit does not pass on
there \[to where the fruit is\]? And whose is the fruit since there is
no experiencer? Therefore this formulation seems to be unsatisfactory."



[169.] Here is the reply:



towards the place of rebirth-linking. The '*conascent formations*' are
the volitions conascent with the impulsion consciousness next to death.
Or they are all those that begin with contact. They fling consciousness
on to that place of rebirth-linking, which is the object of the kamma
and so on. The meaning is that they occur as the cause for the
establishment of consciousness on the object by rebirth-linking as
though flinging it there" (Vism-mhṭ 617).\



31\. "As a continuous process consisting of death, rebirth-linking, and
the adjacent consciousnesses" (Vism-mhṭ 617).



[]



[]



In continuity the fruit\
Is neither of nor from another;\
Seed's forming processes will suit\
To show the purport of this matter.



[170.] When a fruit arises in a single continuity, it is
neither another's nor from other \[kamma\] because absolute identity and
absolute otherness are excluded32 there. The formative processes of
seeds establish the meaning of this. For once the formative processes of
a mango seed, etc., have been set afoot, when the particular fruit
arises in the continuity of the seed's \[growth\], later on owing to the
obtaining of conditions, it does so neither as the fruit of other seeds
nor from other formative processes as condition; and those seeds or
formative processes do not themselves pass on to the place where the
fruit is. This is the analogy here. And the meaning can also be
understood from the fact that the arts, crafts, medicine, etc., learnt
in youth give their fruit later on in maturity.



[171.] Now, it was also asked, "Whose is the fruit, since there
is no experiencer?" Herein:



"Experiencer" is a convention\
For mere arising of the fruit;\
They say "It fruits" as a convention,\
When on a tree appears its fruit.



[172.] Just as it is simply owing to the arising of tree
fruits, which are one part of the phenomena called a tree, that it is
said "The tree fruits" or "The tree has fruited," so it is simply owing
to the arising of the fruit consisting of the pleasure and pain called
experience, which is one part of the aggregates called "deities" and
"human beings," that it is said "A deity or a human being experiences or
feels pleasure or pain." There is therefore no need at all here for a
superfluous experiencer.



[173.] But it may be said: "That may be so; but then these
formations must be the conditions for the fruit either when they are
present or when they are not present, and if it is when they are
present, their result must come about only at the moment of their
occurrence; but if it is when they are not present, they must bear fruit
constantly both before and after their occurrence." It can be replied:



They are conditions when performed;\
They bear fruit once, but not again;\
The agent and such similes\
Will serve to make the meaning plain.



[174.] Formations are conditions for their own fruit because
they have been performed, not because of presence or non-presence,
according as it is said: \[556\] "Due to profitable kamma of the sense
sphere having been performed, stored up \[in the past\], resultant
eye-consciousness arises \[in the present\]" (Dhs §431), and so on.
Having become conditions for their own fruit according to



32\. *Paṭisiddhattā---*"because ... excluded": *paṭisiddha* is not in
PED. *Abhisaṅkhāra* here might mean "planting work," not "formative
processes."

[]



their capacity, they do not again bear fruit since the result has
already ripened. And in explaining the meaning of this the analogy of
the agent, etc., should be understood. For just as in the world when
someone becomes an agent with the aim of completing some business or
other, and he buys goods, say, or obtains a loan, it is simply the fact
of his performing the transaction that is the condition for completing
that business, not the transaction's actual presence or non- presence;
and after the completion of the business he has no further liability.
Why not? Because the business has been completed. So it is because they
have been performed that formations are conditions for their own fruit,
and they do not bear fruit after they have already given fruit according
to their capacity.



Up to this point the occurrence, with formations as condition, of
rebirth- linking consciousness that occurs in the two ways as mixed and
unmixed \[with materiality\] has been illustrated.



*\[(3) How Formations are a Condition for Consciousness\]\
*175. Now, in order to eliminate confusion about all these thirty-two
kinds of



resultant consciousness:



One should of these formations see\
For which and how they are conditions\
In birth and life in all the three\
Kinds of becoming and the rest.



[176.] Herein, the three kinds of becoming, the four kinds of
generation, the five kinds of destiny, the seven stations of
consciousness, and the nine abodes of beings are what are called "The
kinds of becoming and the rest." The meaning is that it should be
recognized for what kinds of resultant consciousness these
\[formations\] are conditions in rebirth-linking and in the course of an
individual existence, and in what way they are conditions in the various
kinds of becoming and so on.



[177.] Herein, firstly as regard the *formation of merit*: the
formation of merit comprising the eight volitions of the sense sphere
((1)--(8)) is a condition in two ways, as kamma condition acting from a
different time and as decisive-support condition, equally for all the
nine kinds of resultant consciousness ((41)--(49)) in rebirth-linking in
a happy destiny in the sense-sphere becoming. That formation comprising
the five profitable volitions of the fine-material sphere ((9)--(13))
\[is a condition\] in like manner for the five kinds of rebirth-linking
in the fine-material becoming ((57)--(61)).



[178.] That of the sense sphere divided up as aforesaid is a
condition in two ways, as aforesaid, for seven kinds of limited
\[-sphere\] resultant consciousness ((34)--(40))---excluding the
root-causeless mind-consciousness element accompanied by equanimity
(41)---in the course of an existence, but not in rebirth- linking, in
the happy destinies in the sense-sphere becoming. And that same
formation is a condition likewise for five kinds of resultant
consciousness ((34), (35), (39)--(41)) in the course of an existence,
not in rebirth-linking, in the fine- material becoming. It is a
condition likewise for eight kinds of limited \[-sphere\]



[]



[]



resultant consciousness ((34)--(41)) in the course of existence, not in
rebirth- linking, in the unhappy destinies in the sense-sphere becoming.
\[557\] For then it is a condition \[for such profitable-resultant
consciousness occurring\] in hell encountering a desirable object \[on
such occasions\] as the Elder Mahā Moggallāna's visits to hell, and so
on. But among animals and powerful ghosts too a desirable object is
obtained \[through the same condition\].



[179.] This eightfold formation of merit is also a condition
likewise for sixteen kinds of profitable-resultant consciousness in the
course of an existence ((34)-- (41)) and in rebirth-linking ((42)--(49))
in the happy destinies in the sense- sphere becoming. It is also a
condition equally for all ten kinds of resultant consciousness in the
course of an existence ((34), (35), (39)--(41)) and in rebirth- linking
((57)--(61)) in the fine-material becoming.



[180.] The *formation of demerit*, comprising the twelve
unprofitable volitions ((22)--(33)), is a condition likewise in the
unhappy destinies in the sense-sphere becoming for one kind of
consciousness in rebirth-linking (56), not in the course of an
existence; also for six kinds in the course of an existence
((50)--(55)), not in rebirth-linking; and for all the seven kinds partly
in the course of an existence and partly in rebirth-linking. And in the
happy destinies in the sense-sphere becoming it is a condition likewise
for those same seven kinds in the course of an existence, not in
rebirth-linking. In the fine-material becoming it is a condition
likewise for four kinds of resultant consciousness ((50)--(51), (55),
(56)) in the course of an existence, not in rebirth-linking. Then it is
a condition for \[Brahmās'\] seeing undesirable visible data and hearing
undesirable sounds that are in the sense sphere: there are no
undesirable visible data, etc., in the Brahmā-world itself; and likewise
in the divine world of the sense sphere.33



[181.]The *formation of the imperturbable* is a condition
likewise for four kinds of resultant consciousness ((62)--(65)) in the
course of an existence and in rebirth- linking in the immaterial
becoming.



This, firstly, is how it should be understood what kinds of resultant
consciousness these formations are conditions for in rebirth-linking and
in the \[three\] kinds of becoming, and in what way they are conditions.
And it should also be understood in the same way of the kinds of
generation and so on.



[182.] Here is a statement of the bare headings starting from
the beginning. Of these \[three kinds of\] formations, firstly the
formation of merit, when giving rebirth-linking, produces the whole of
its result in two of the kinds of becoming; likewise in the four kinds
of generation beginning with the egg-born, in two of the kinds of
destiny, in other words, the divine and the human; in four of the
stations of consciousness, \[the human, and the planes of the first,
second and third jhānas,\] described thus, "Different in body and
different in perception ... different in body and same in perception ...
same in body and different in perception ... same in body and same in
perception ...;" (D III 253) and in only



33\. Vism-mhṭ points out that this is generally but not always so, since
deities see such portents of their death as the fading of their flowers,
etc., which are undesirable visible data (see note 43).



[]



[]



four of the abodes of beings, because in the abode of non-percipient
beings it only forms materiality. Therefore it is a condition in the way
already stated for twenty-one kinds of resultant consciousness in these
two kinds of becoming, four kinds of generation, two kinds of destiny,
four stations of consciousness, and four abodes of beings according as
they are produced in rebirth-linking ((41)--(49), (57)--(61)) \[558\]
and the course of an existence ((34)--(41)), as appropriate.



[183.] The formation of demerit as rebirth-linking ripens in
the sense- sphere becoming only, in the four kinds of generation, in the
remaining three destinies, in the one station of consciousness described
thus "different in body and same in perception" (D III 253), and in the
one corresponding abode of beings. Therefore it is a condition in the
way already stated for seven kinds of resultant consciousness in one
kind of becoming, in four kinds of generation, in three kinds of
destiny, in one station of consciousness, and in one abode of beings,
both in rebirth-linking (56) and in the course of an existence
((50)--(56)).



[184.]The formation of the imperturbable as rebirth-linking
ripens in the immaterial becoming, in the apparitional kind of
generation only, in the divine destiny only, in the three stations of
consciousness beginning with the base consisting of boundless space, and
in the four abodes of beings beginning with the base consisting of
boundless space ((62)-- (65)). Therefore it is a condition in the way
already stated for the four kinds of consciousness in one kind of
becoming, in one kind of generation, in one kind of destiny, in three
stations of consciousness, and in four abodes of beings, both in
rebirth-linking and in the course of becoming.34



[185.] This is how:



One should of these formations see\
For which and how they are conditions



34\. A Sinhalese text adds the following paragraph: "Also the bodily
formation, when giving rebirth-linking, gives the whole of its results
in the sense-sphere becoming alone in the four generations, in the five
destinies, in the first two stations of consciousness, and in two abodes
of beings. Therefore it is a condition in the way already stated for the
twenty-three kinds of consciousness in one kind of becoming, four
generations, five destinies, two stations of consciousness, and two
abodes of beings, both in rebirth-linking and in the course of an
existence. The same method applies to the verbal formation. But the
mental formation does not fail to ripen anywhere except in one abode of
beings. Therefore it is a condition in the way already stated for the
thirty-two kinds of resultant consciousness, as appropriate, in the
three kinds of becoming, four generations, five destinies, seven
stations of consciousness, and eight abodes of beings, both in
rebirth-linking and in the course of an existence. There is no
consciousness with formations as condition in the non-percipient abode
of beings. Furthermore, in the case of non-percipient beings, the
formation of merit is a condition, as kamma condition acting from a
different time, for the kinds of materiality due to kamma performed."



[]



[]



In birth and life and the three\
Kinds of becoming and the rest.



This is the detailed explanation of the clause, "With formations as
condition,



consciousness."



\[(IV) MENTALITY-MATERIALITY\]



[186.] For the clause, "With consciousness as condition,
mentality-materiality":



\(1\) By analysis of mind and matter,\
(2) Occurrence in becoming, etc.,\
(3) Inclusion, and (4) manner of condition,\
The exposition should be known.



[187.] *1.*  *By analysis of mind and matter*: here "mind"
(*nāma---*mentality) is the three aggregates, that is, feeling,
perception, and formations, because of their bending (*namana*) on to
the object. "Matter" (*rūpa---*materiality) is the four great primary
elements and the materiality derived \[by clinging\] from the four great
primaries. Their analysis is given in the Description of the Aggregates
(XIV.34f., 125f.). This, in the first place, is how the exposition of
mentality-materiality should be known "by analysis."



[188.] *2.* *By occurrence in becoming, et cetera*: excepting
one abode of beings, \[that is, the non-percipient,\] mentality occurs
in all the kinds of becoming, generation, destiny, and station of
consciousness, and in the remaining abodes of beings. Materiality occurs
in two kinds of becoming, four kinds of generation, five destinies, the
first four stations of consciousness, and the first five abodes of
beings.



[189.]Now, when this mentality-materiality occurs thus, \[559\]
then in the case of sexless embryos and the egg-born, at the moment of
their rebirth-linking there are manifested as materiality two organic
continuities, that is, the two decads of physical basis and body, and
also the three immaterial aggregates. So in their case there are in
detail these twenty-three states, namely, twenty states as concrete
matter and three immaterial aggregates, which should be understood as
"mentality-materiality with consciousness as condition." But omitting
repetitions,35 and so cancelling nine material instances (see 11.88)
from one of the organic continuities, fourteen states remain.



By adding the sex decad for those possessed of sex \[before making the
above cancellation\] there are thirty-three. And omitting repetitions
and so cancelling eighteen material instances \[nine each\] from two of
the organic continuities, in this case fifteen states remain.



[190.] At the moment of rebirth-linking of those of Brahmā's
Retinue, among apparitionally born beings, four organic continuities are
manifested as materiality, that is, the decads of eye, ear, and physical
basis, and the ennead of the life faculty, and three immaterial
aggregates. So in their case in detail these



35\. Resolve compound *agahitagahaṇena * as  *gahitassa a-gahaṇena,* not
as *a-gahitassa gahaṇena; * i.e. it is "by not taking what is taken,"
not "by taking what has not been taken"; cf. IV.75.



[]



[]



forty-two states, namely, thirty-nine states as concrete materiality and
three immaterial aggregates, should be understood as
"mentality-materiality with consciousness as condition." But omitting
repetitions and so cancelling twenty- seven instances of materiality
\[nine each\] from three of the organic continuities, fifteen states
remain.



[191.] In the sense-sphere becoming, seven organic continuities
are manifested as materiality, and also three immaterial aggregates at
the moment of rebirth- linking of the remaining kinds of apparitionally
born or of the moisture-born possessing sex and matured sense bases. So
in their case in detail these seventy- three states, namely, seventy
instances of concrete materiality and three immaterial aggregates,
should be understood as "mentality-materiality with formations as
condition." But omitting repetitions and so cancelling fifty-four
material instances \[nine each\] from six of the organic continuities,
nineteen states remain.



This is the maximum. But at minimum the computation of "mentality-
materiality with consciousness as condition" in the rebirth-linking of
those who lack such and such an organic continuity can be understood in
brief and detail by reducing it appropriately. \[The blind, for
instance, lack the eye decad.\]



[192.] For mentality-materiality immaterial beings have only
the three \[mental\] aggregates; while non-percipient beings have only
the life-faculty ennead, and that represents materiality.



[193.] In the course of an existence, in all places where
materiality occurs there is manifested the temperature-originated bare
\[material\] octad, which is due \[initially\] to the temperature that
occurred together with the rebirth-linking consciousness at the moment
of its presence.36 Rebirth-linking consciousness does not originate
materiality. For, just as a man who is falling into a chasm cannot
support another, so it, too, is unable to originate materiality because
of its weakness, which is due to the weakness of the physical basis. But
from the first life-continuum after the rebirth-linking consciousness
onwards, \[560\] the bare octad originated by consciousness appears. And
at the time when sound becomes manifest there is the sound ennead due
both to temperature occurring after the moment of rebirth-linking and to
consciousness.



[194.] The bare octad originated by nutriment appears in beings
in the womb who live on matter consisting of physical nutriment as soon
as their body is suffused by nutriment swallowed by the mother; for it
is said:



And so it is that when his mother\
Eats, consuming food and drink,\
One hidden in his mother's womb\
Thereby obtains his nourishment (S I 206).



And it appears in apparitionally born beings as soon as they first
swallow



the spittle that has come into their own mouths.



36\. "This means, due to the heat element in the materiality that arose
together with the rebirth-linking consciousness. It is because the
heart-basis is arisen only at that very moment, that there is weakness
of the physical basis" (Vism-mhṭ 622).



[]



[]



So, with the twenty-six \[material instances\] consisting of the bare
octad originated by nutriment, and of the, at most, two \[sound\]
enneads originated respectively by temperature and consciousness, and
also with the already- mentioned seventy kamma-originated instances
(§191) that arise three times in each conscious moment \[at the instants
of arising, presence, and dissolution\], there are thus ninety-six
material instances; and with the three immaterial aggregates there is
thus a total of ninety-nine states.



[195.] Or because sound is not regularly present since it is
only sometimes manifested, subtracting it therefore as twofold \[being
temperature-originated and consciousness-originated\], there are these
ninety-seven states to be understood as "mentality-materiality with
consciousness as condition" in all beings, according as it happens to be
produced. For whether these beings are sleeping or idling or eating or
drinking, these states keep on occurring in them day and night with
consciousness as condition. And we shall explain later how they have
consciousness as their condition (see §200ff.).



[196.] Now, although this kamma-born materiality is the first
to find a footing in the several kinds of becoming, generation, destiny,
station of consciousness, and abode of beings, it is nevertheless unable
to carry on without being consolidated by materiality of triple
origination \[by consciousness, temperature, and nutriment\], nor can
that of triple origination do so without being consolidated by the
former. But when they thus give consolidating support to each other,
they can stand up without falling, like sheaves of reeds propped
together on all four sides, even though battered by the wind, and like
\[boats with\] broken floats37 that have found a support, even though
battered by waves somewhere in mid-ocean, and they can last one year,
two years ... a hundred years, until those beings' life span or their
merit is exhausted.



This is how the exposition should be understood here "by occurrence in



becoming, etc."



[197.] *3. By inclusion*: now there is (a) the simple mentality
with consciousness as condition in both the course of an existence and
rebirth-linking in the immaterial sphere, and in the course of an
existence in the five-constituent becoming, and (b) the simple
materiality with consciousness as condition in both cases among the
non-percipient, and in the course of an existence in the
five-constituent becoming, and (c) the \[combined\]
mentality-materiality \[561\] with consciousness as condition in both
cases in the five-constituent becoming. All that mentality and
materiality and mentality-materiality should be understood as
"mentality-materiality with consciousness as condition," including them
under mentality-materiality according to the method that allows any one
part to represent any remaining one of its kind.38



37\. *Vāhanika---*"having a float": not in PED. The context suggests a
catamaran, universal in Indian waters.\



38\. The expression "*ekadesasarūpekasesa*"* * is grammatically
explained at Vism-mhṭ 623; see allied expressions, "*katekasesa*" (§204)
and "*ekasese kate*" (§223). Cf. *Pāṇini* I 2, 64.



[]



[]



[198.] Is this correct in view of the absence of consciousness
in non-percipient beings?---It is not incorrect. For:



This consciousness, as cause of mind\
And matter, is twice reckoned:\
Result, and also not-result.\
Wherefore this is correctly said.



[199.] The consciousness that is the cause of
mentality-materiality is reckoned to be twofold classed as resultant and
not resultant. And since in the case of non-percipient beings
materiality is originated by kamma, it has as its condition
kamma-formation consciousness that occurred in the five-constituent
becoming. This applies also to the kamma-originated materiality arising
in the course of an existence in the five-constituent becoming at the
moment of profitable or any other consciousness. So this is correct.



This is how the exposition can also be known here "by inclusion."



[200.] *4.* *By manner of condition*: here:



Resultant-consciousness conditions\
Mentality first in nine ways,\
Then basis matter in nine ways,\
And other matter in eight ways;



Formation-consciousness conditions\
This matter in a single way.\
The rest of consciousness conditions\
This matter as the case may be.



[201.] Rebirth-linking or some other kind of resultant
consciousness is a condition in nine ways, as conascence, mutuality,
support, association, kamma- result, nutriment, faculty, presence, and
non-disappearance conditions, either at rebirth-linking or in the course
of an existence, for that mentality called resultant, whether mixed with
materiality or not. At rebirth-linking it is a condition in nine ways,
as conascence, mutuality, support, kamma-result, nutriment, faculty,
dissociation, presence, and non-disappearance conditions, for the
materiality of the physical \[heart-\] basis. It is a condition in eight
ways, namely, as the above conditions omitting the mutuality condition,
for materiality other than the materiality of the physical basis.



Kamma-formation consciousness is a condition in one way only, as
decisive- support condition, for the materiality of non-percipient
beings, or for the kamma- born materiality in the five-constituent
becoming, according to the Suttanta method.



All the remaining kinds of consciousness from the time of the first
life- continuum \[consciousness following rebirth-linking\] onwards
should be understood as a condition for some kind of
mentality-materiality as appropriate. But since the whole contents of
the Paṭṭhāna must be cited in order to show how it acts in detail, we do
not undertake that.



[202.] Here it may be asked: "But how is it to be known \[562\]
that the mentality-



materiality of rebirth-linking has consciousness as its condition?" From
the



[]



[]



suttas and from logic. For in the suttas it is established in many
places that feeling, etc., have consciousness as condition in the way
beginning, "States with parallel occurrence through consciousness" (Dhs
§1522). But as to logic:



From matter seen here to be born\
Of consciousness a man can tell\
That consciousness is a condition\
For matter when unseen as well.



Whether consciousness likes it or not, \[certain\] material instances
are seen to arise in conformity with it. And the unseen is inferred from
the seen. So it can be known, by means of the consciousness-born
materiality that is seen, that consciousness is also a condition for the
unseen materiality of rebirth-linking. For it is said in the Paṭṭhāna
that, like the consciousness-originated, also the kamma-originated has
consciousness as its condition (see Paṭṭh I 172--73).



This is how the exposition should be known "by manner of condition."



This is the detailed explanation of the clause "With consciousness as



condition, mentality-materiality."



\[(V) THE SIXFOLD BASE\]



[203.] As to the clause "With mentality-materiality as
condition, the sixfold base":



Three aggregates are "mind"; the basis,\
Primaries, and the rest are "matter":\
And while all that conditions this\
A part can represent the rest.



[204.] In the case of the mentality-materiality that is here a
condition for the sixfold base, mentality is the three aggregates
beginning with feeling, while materiality should be understood as that
included in one's own continuity stated thus "primaries and the rest are
'matter'," that is to say, the four primaries, six physical bases, and
life faculty, \[since they are conditioning factors\] invariably. But
this mentality and this materiality and this mentality-materiality, each
one representing the rest as "mentality-materiality," should be
understood as a condition for the sixfold base consisting of the sixth
base and the sixfold base each one representing the rest as the "sixfold
base." Why? Because in the immaterial becoming there is only mentality
as a condition, and that is a condition only for the sixth base,
\[namely, the mind base,\] not for any other. For it is said in the
Vibhaṅga, "With mentality as condition, the sixth base" (Vibh 179).



[205.] Here it may be asked: "But how is it to be known that
mentality-materiality is a condition for the sixfold base?" Because the
latter exists when mentality- materiality exists. For a given base
exists when a given kind of mentality and materiality exists, not
otherwise. But the way in which the one comes to exist when the other
does will be explained below in the section dealing with how it is a
condition. \[563\] Therefore:



A wise man should contrive to tell\
Which one conditions which, and how,



[]



[]



At rebirth and in life as well;\
\[The explanation follows now.\]



[206.] Herein what follows illustrates the meaning.



\[(1) Mentality as Condition\]



In immaterial rebirth\
And life the mind alone will come\
In seven ways and six to be\
Condition at the minimum.



[207.] How? In rebirth-linking, firstly, mentality is a
condition in seven ways at the minimum, as conascence, mutuality,
support, association, kamma-result, presence, and non-disappearance
conditions, for the sixth base. Some mentality, however, is a condition,
as root-cause condition \[that is, greed, etc.,\] and some as nutriment
condition \[that is, contact and mental volition\]. So it is also a
condition in other ways. It is by the \[two latter\] that the maximum
and minimum should be understood. In the course of an existence, too,
resultant mentality is a condition as already stated. But the other
\[non-resultant\] kind is a condition in six ways at minimum, as the
aforesaid conditions except for kamma-result condition. Some, however,
are a condition, as root-cause condition, and some as nutriment
condition. So it is also a condition in other ways. It is by these that
the maximum and minimum should be understood.



[208.] In five-constituent becoming At rebirth, mind in the
same ways\
Acts as condition for the sixth,\
And for the others in six ways.



[209.] Besides the immaterial states, also in the
five-constituent becoming that resultant mentality, in association with
the heart-basis, is a condition in seven ways at the minimum for the
sixth, the mind base, in the same way as was said with respect to the
immaterial states. But in association with the four primary elements, it
is a condition in six ways, as conascence, support, kamma-result,
dissociation, presence, and non-disappearance conditions, for the other
five beginning with the eye base. Some, however, are a condition as
root-cause condition, and some as nutriment condition. It is by these
that the maximum and minimum should be understood.



[210.] Result is for result condition During a life in the same
ways;\
While non-result the non-resultant\
Sixth conditions in six ways.



[211.] For, as in rebirth-linking, so also in the course of an
existence in the five- constituent becoming, resultant mentality is a
condition in the seven ways at minimum for the resultant sixth base. But
non-resultant mentality is a condition in six ways at minimum for the
non-resultant sixth base, leaving out kamma- result condition. The
maximum and minimum should be understood in the way already stated.



[]



[]



[212.] And during life, result conditions The other five in
fourfold way;\
The non-resultant kind can be\
Explained in the aforesaid way. \[564\]



[213.] Again, in the course of an existence, the other
resultant mentality, which has as its physical basis the eye
sensitivity, etc., is a condition in four ways, as postnascence,
dissociation, presence, and non-disappearance conditions, for the rest
of the five beginning with the eye base. And as the resultant, so also
the non-resultant is explained; therefore \[the mentality\] classed as
profitable, etc., should be understood as their condition in four ways.



This, firstly, is how it should be understood what bases mentality alone
is a condition for in rebirth-linking and in the course of an existence,
and how it is a condition.



[214.] \[(2)  *Materiality as Condition*\]



Not even for a single base\
In immaterial becoming\
Is matter a condition here.\
But in five-aggregate becoming



Basis as matter is condition\
At rebirth in a sixfold way\
For the sixth base; the primaries\
Are for the five in fourfold way.



[215.] As to matter, the materiality of the physical \[heart-\]
basis is a condition in rebirth-linking in six ways, as conascence,
mutuality, support, dissociation, presence, and non-disappearance
conditions, for the sixth, the mind base. But the four primaries are in
general, that is to say, in rebirth-linking and in the course of an
existence, conditions in four ways, as conascence, support, presence,
and non-disappearance conditions, for any of the five bases beginning
with the eye, whenever they arise.



[216.] Life and in lifetime food as well. Conditions five in
threefold way;\
These five, the sixth in sixfold way;\
Basis, the sixth in fivefold way.



[217.] But in rebirth-linking and in the course of an existence
the material life \[faculty\] is a condition in three ways, as presence,
non-disappearance, and faculty conditions, for these five beginning with
the eye. Nutriment too is a condition in three ways, as presence,
non-disappearance, and nutriment conditions, and that is so in the
course of an existence, not in rebirth-linking, and applies when the
bodies of beings subsisting on nutriment are suffused with the
nutriment. In the course of an existence, not in rebirth-linking, those
five bases beginning with the eye are conditions in six ways, as
support, prenascence, faculty, dissociation, presence and
non-disappearance conditions, for \[that part of\] the sixth, the mind
base, comprising eye-, ear-, nose-, tongue-, and body-consciousness. But
in the course of an existence, not at rebirth-linking, the materiality
of the \[heart-



[]



[]



\] basis is a condition in five ways, as support, prenascence,
dissociation, presence, and non-disappearance conditions, for the
remaining mind base apart from the five consciousnesses. This is how it
should be understood what bases materiality alone is a condition for in
rebirth-linking and in the course of an existence, and how it is a
condition. \[565\]



\[(3) Mentality-Materiality as Condition\]



[218.] Which mind-cum-matter combination Is a condition for
which kind\
And how it is so in each case,\
A wise man should now seek to find.



[219.] For example, firstly, in rebirth-linking in the
five-constituent becoming, the mentality-materiality, in other words,
the trio of aggregates with the materiality of the \[heart-\] basis, is
a condition, as conascence, mutuality, support, kamma- result,
association, dissociation, presence, and non-disappearance conditions,
etc., for the sixth, the mind base. This is merely the heading; but
since it can all be construed in the way already stated, the detail is
not given here.



This is the detailed explanation of the clause "With
mentality-materiality as



condition, the sixfold base."



\[(VI) CONTACT\]



[220.] As to the clause "With the sixfold base as condition,
contact":



Contact is briefly of six kinds\
With eye-contact and others too;\
According to each consciousness\
It is in detail thirty-two.



[221.] Briefly, with the clause "With the sixfold base as
condition, contact," there are only the six kinds beginning with
eye-contact, that is to say, eye-contact, ear-contact, nose-contact,
tongue-contact, body-contact, and mind-contact. But in detail the five
profitable resultant and the five unprofitable resultant beginning with
eye-contact make ten; the rest, which are associated with the twenty-two
kinds of mundane resultant consciousness, make twenty-two. So all these
come to thirty-two ((34)--(65)), like the consciousness with formations
as condition given above.



[222.] But as to the sixfold base that is a condition for this
thirty-twofold contact. Herein:



Some wise men take the sixfold base\
To be the five internal bases\
With the sixth; but others count\
These plus the six external bases.



[223.] Herein, firstly, there are those who take this to be an
exposition of the occurrence of what is clung to, \[that is,
kammically-acquired aggregates,\] and they maintain that the
conditioning \[bases\] and the conditionally-arisen \[contact\] are only
what is included in one's own continuity. They take any one part to



[]



[]



represent any remaining one of its kind, since the condition for contact
in the immaterial states is the sixth base \[only\], according to the
text "With the sixth base as condition, contact" (Vibh 179), and
elsewhere it is the sixfold base inclusively. So they have it that
"sixfold base" means the internal \[five\] beginning with the eye plus
the sixth (mind) base. For that sixth base and that sixfold base are
styled "sixfold base." But there are those who maintain that it is only
the conditionally-arisen \[contact\] that is contained in a single
continuity, while the conditioning \[bases\] are contained in separate
\[that is, past\] continuities as well. They maintain that all and any
such bases are a condition for contact, and they include also the
\[six\] external ones. So they have it that "sixfold base" means the
same internal \[five\] plus the sixth plus the external ones beginning
with visible data. For that sixth base and that \[partial\] sixfold base
and the sixfold base along with these \[external ones\] each
representing the rest \[566\] are styled sixfold base too.



[224.] Here it may be asked: "One kind of contact does not
derive from all the bases, nor all the kinds of contact from one base.
And yet 'With the sixfold base as condition, contact' is said in the
singular. Why is that?"



[225.] Here is the answer: It is true that neither is one
derived from all nor all from one. However, one is derived from many.
For eye-contact is derived from the eye base, from the visible-data
base, from the mind base reckoned as eye- consciousness, and from the
mental-datum base consisting of the remaining associated states. And
each case should be construed as appropriate in this way. Therefore:



Though stated in the singular,\
He shows therewith in all such cases\
That this contact, though only one,\
Is yet derived from several bases.



*Though stated in the singular*: the meaning is, by this statement in
the singular that "With the sixfold base as condition, contact," it is
pointed out by the Blessed One (*Tādin*) that contact, which is of one
kind, comes into being from many bases.



\[How the Sixfold Base is a Condition for Contact\]



[226.] But as regards these bases:



Five in six ways; and after that\
One in nine ways; the external six\
As contact's conditionality\
According to each case we fix.



[227.] Here is the explanation: firstly, the five consisting of
the eye base, etc., are conditions in six ways, as support, prenascence,
faculty, dissociation, presence, and non-disappearance conditions, for
contact classed in five ways as eye- contact, and so on. After that, the
single resultant mind base is a condition in nine ways, as conascence,
mutuality, support, result, nutriment, faculty, association, presence,
and non-disappearance conditions, for the variously-



[]



[]



classed resultant mind contact. But in the case of the external bases,
the visible- data base is a condition in four ways, as object,
prenascence, presence, and non- disappearance conditions, for
eye-contact. Likewise the sound base, etc., respectively for
ear-contact, and so on. But these and mental data as object are
conditions likewise, and as object condition too, for mind-contact, so
"the external six as contact's conditionality according to each case we
fix."



This is the detailed explanation of the clause "With the sixfold base as



condition, contact."



\[(VII) FEELING\]



[228.] As to the clause "With contact as condition, feeling":



Feelings, when named by way of door\
"Eye-contact-born" and all the rest,\
Are only six; but then they are\
At nine and eighty sorts assessed.



[229.] In the analysis of this clause \[in the Vibhaṅga\] only
six kinds of feeling according to door are given thus, "Eye-contact-born
feeling, ear-, nose-, tongue-, body-, mind-contact-born feeling" (Vibh
136). \[567\] Still, when classed according to association with the
eighty-nine kinds of consciousness, they are "at nine and eighty sorts
assessed."



[230.] But from the nine and eighty feelings Thirty-two, no
more, appear\
Associated with result,\
And only those are mentioned here.



Herein, contact in the five doors\
Conditions five in eightfold way,\
And single way the rest; it acts\
In the mind door in the same way.



[231.] Herein, in the five doors contact beginning with
eye-contact is a condition in eight ways, as conascence, mutuality,
support, result, nutriment, association, presence, and non-disappearance
conditions, for the five kinds of feeling that have respectively eye
sensitivity, etc., as their physical basis. But that contact beginning
with eye-contact is a condition in one way only, as decisive-support
condition, for the rest of resultant feeling in the sense sphere
occurring in each door as receiving, investigation and registration.



[232.] *In the mind door in the same way: the contact* called
conascent mind-contact is also a condition in the same eight ways for
sense-sphere resultant feeling occurring as registration in the mind
door, and so also for the kinds of resultant feeling in the three planes
occurring with rebirth-linking, life-continuum and death. But the
mind-contact associated with mind-door adverting is a condition in one
way only, as decisive-support condition, for the kinds of feeling that
occur in the mind door as registration in the sense sphere.



This is the detailed explanation of the clause "With contact as
condition,



feeling."



[]



[]



\[(VIII) CRAVING\]



[233.] As regards the clause "With feeling as condition,
craving":



Six cravings, for things visible\
and all the rest, are treated here;\
And each of these, when it occurs,\
Can in one of three modes appear.



[234.] Six kinds of craving are shown in the analysis of this
clause \[in the Vibhaṅga\] as "visible-data craving, sound, odour,
flavour, tangible-data, and mental-data craving" (Vibh 136), called
after their objects, as a son is called after his father "banker's son,"
"brahman's son." Each of these six kinds of craving is reckoned
threefold according to its mode of occurrence as craving for sense
desires, craving for becoming, or craving for non-becoming.



[235.] When visible-data craving occurs enjoying with
sense-desire enjoyment a visible datum as object that has come into the
focus of the eye, it is called craving for sense desires. But when
\[that same visible-data craving\] occurs along with the eternity view
that assumes that same object to be lasting and eternal, \[568\] it is
called craving for becoming; for it is the greed accompanying the
eternity view that is called craving for becoming. When it occurs along
with the annihilation view that assumes that same object to break up and
be destroyed, it is called craving for non-becoming; for it is the greed
accompanying the annihilation view that is called craving for
non-becoming. So also in the case of craving for sounds, and so on.



These amount to eighteen kinds of craving. The eighteen with respect to
one's own visible data (one's own appearance), etc., and eighteen with
respect to external \[visible data (another's appearance), etc.,\]
together make thirty-six kinds. Thirty-six in the past, thirty-six in
the future, and thirty-six in the present, make one-hundred-and-eight
kinds of craving. When these are reduced again, they should be
understood to amount to the six kinds only with visible data, etc., as
object; and these, to three only, as craving for sense desires, and so
on.



[236.] Out of selfish affection for feeling after taking
pleasure in it when it arises through a visible datum as object, etc.,
these beings accord much honour to painters, musicians, perfumers,
cooks, weavers, distillers of elixirs,39 physicians, etc., who furnish
respectively visible data as object, etc., just as out of affection for
a child they reward the child's nurse after taking pleasure in the
child. That is why it should be understood that these three kinds of
craving have feeling as their condition.



[237.] What is intended here is but Resultant pleasant feeling;
hence\
'Tis a condition in one way\
For all this craving's occurrence.



*In one way*: it is a condition as decisive-support condition only.

A man in pain for pleasure longs,\
And finding pleasure, longs for more;\
The peace of equanimity\
Is counted pleasure too; therefore



The Greatest Sage announced the law\
"With feeling as condition, craving,"\
Since all three feelings thus can be\
Conditions for all kinds of craving.



Though feeling is condition, still\
Without inherent tendency\
No craving can arise, and so\
From this the perfect saint is free.40



This is the detailed explanation of the clause "With feeling as
condition,



craving."



\[(IX) CLINGING\]



[239.] As regards the clause "With craving as condition,
clinging":



Four clingings need to be explained\
(1) As to analysis of meaning,\
(2) As to the brief and full account\
Of states, (3) and also as to order. \[569\]



[240.] Herein, this is the explanation: firstly, there are
these four kinds of clinging here, namely, sense-desire clinging,
\[false-\] view clinging, rules-and-vows clinging, and self-doctrine
clinging.



[241.] *1.* The *analysis of meaning* is this: it clings to the
kind of sense-desire called sense-desire's physical object (see Ch. IV,
n. 24), thus it is sense-desire clinging. Also, it is sense-desire and
it is clinging, thus it is sense-desire clinging. Clinging (*upādāna*)
is firm grasping; for here the prefix *upa* has the sense of firmness,
as in *upāyāsa* (great misery---see §48) and *upakuṭṭha* (great pox),41
and so on. Likewise, it is \[false\] view and it is clinging, thus it is
\[false-\] view clinging; or, it clings to



40\. "'*Though feeling is condition*' is said in order to prevent a
generalization from the preceding words 'With feeling as condition' to
the effect that craving arises in the presence of every condition
accompanied by feeling---But is it not impossible to prevent
over-generalization in the absence of any such statements as 'Feeling
accompanied by inherent tendency is a condition for craving'?---No; for
we are dealing with an exposition of the round of rebirths. Since there
is no round of rebirths without inherent tendencies, so far as the
meaning is concerned it may be taken for granted that the condition is
accompanied by inherent tendency. Or alternatively, it may be recognized
that this condition is accompanied by inherent tendency because it
follows upon the words 'With ignorance as condition.' And with the words
'With feeling as condition, craving' the ruling needed is this: 'There
is craving only with feeling as condition,' and not 'With feeling as
condition there is only craving'" (Vism-mhṭ). For inherent tendencies
see XXII.45, 60; MN 64. The Arahant has none.



41\. *Upakuṭṭha---*"great pox" or "great leprosy": not in PED; see
*kuṭṭha.*



[]



[]



\[false\] view, thus it is \[false-\] view clinging; for in \[the case
of the false view\] "The world and self are eternal" (D I 14), etc., it
is the latter kind of view that clings to the former. Likewise, it
clings to rite and ritual, thus it is rules-and- vows clinging; also, it
is rite and ritual and it is clinging, thus it is rules-and- vows
clinging; for ox asceticism, ox vows, etc. (see M I 387f.), are
themselves kinds of clinging, too, because of the misinterpretation
(insistence) that purification comes about in this way. Likewise, they
indoctrinate by means of that, thus that is doctrine; they cling by
means of that, thus that is clinging. What do they indoctrinate with?
What do they cling to? Self. The clinging to doctrines of self is
self-doctrine clinging. Or by means of that they cling to a self that is
a mere doctrine of self; thus that is self-doctrine clinging. This,
firstly, is the "analysis of meaning."



[242.] *2. * But as regards *the brief and*  *full account of
states*, firstly, in brief sense- desire clinging is called "firmness of
craving" since it is said: "Herein, what is sense-desire clinging? That
which in the case of sense desires is lust for sense desires, greed for
sense desires, delight in sense desires, craving for sense desires,
fever of sense desires, infatuation with sense desires, committal to
sense desires: that is called sense-desire clinging" (Dhs §1214).
"Firmness of craving" is a name for the subsequent craving itself, which
has become firm by the influence of previous craving, which acts as its
decisive-support condition. But some have said: Craving is the aspiring
to an object that one has not yet reached, like a thief's stretching out
his hand in the dark; clinging is the grasping of an object that one has
reached, like the thief's grasping his objective. These states oppose
fewness of wishes and contentment and so they are the roots of the
suffering due to seeking and guarding (see D II 58f.). The remaining
three kinds of clinging are in brief simply \[false\] view.



[243.] In detail, however, sense-desire clinging is the firm
state of the craving described above as of one-hundred-and-eight kinds
with respect to visible data and so on. \[False-\] view clinging is the
ten-based wrong view, according as it is said: "Herein what is
\[false-\] view clinging? There is no giving, no offering, ... \[no good
and virtuous ascetics and brahmans who have themselves\] realized by
direct-knowledge and declare this world and the other world: such view
as this ... such perverse assumption is called \[false-\]view clinging"
(Vibh 375; Dhs §1215). Rules-and-vows clinging is the adherence \[to the
view that\] purification comes through rules and vows, according as it
is said: "Herein, what is rules- and-vows clinging? ... That
purification comes through a rite, that purification comes through a
ritual, \[570\] that purification comes through a rite and ritual: such
view as this ... such perverse assumption is called rules-and-vows
clinging" (Dhs §1216). Self-doctrine clinging is the twenty-based
\[false\] view of individuality, according as it is said: "Herein, what
is self-doctrine clinging? Here the untaught ordinary man ... untrained
in good men's Dhamma, sees materiality as self ... such perverse
assumption is called self-doctrine clinging" (Dhs §1217). This is the
"brief and full account of states."



[244.] *3. As to order*: here order is threefold (see XIV.211),
that is to say, order of



arising, order of abandoning, and order of teaching. Herein, order of
arising of



[]



[]



defilements is not meant literally because there is no first arising of
defilements in the beginningless round of rebirths. But in a relative
sense it is this: usually in a single becoming the misinterpretation of
(insistence on) eternity and annihilation are preceded by the assumption
of a self. After that, when a man assumes that this self is eternal,
rules-and-vows clinging arises in him for the purpose of purifying the
self. And when a man assumes that it breaks up, thus disregarding the
next world, sense-desire clinging arises in him. So self-doctrine
clinging arises first, and after that, \[false-\] view clinging, and
rules-and-vows clinging or sense-desire clinging. This, then, is their
order of arising in one becoming.



[245.] And here \[false-\] view clinging, etc., are abandoned
first because they are eliminated by the path of stream-entry.
Sense-desire clinging is abandoned later because it is eliminated by the
path of Arahantship. This is the order of their abandoning.



[246.] Sense-desire clinging, however, is taught first among
them because of the breadth of its objective field and because of its
obviousness. For it has a broad objective field because it is associated
with eight kinds of consciousness ((22)--(29)). The others have a narrow
objective field because they are associated with four kinds of
consciousness ((22), (23), (26) and (27)). And usually it is
sense-desire clinging that is obvious because of this generation's love
of attachment (see M I 167), not so the other kinds. One possessed of
sense-desire clinging is much given to display and ceremony (see M I
265) for the purpose of attaining sense desires. \[False-\] view
clinging comes next to the \[sense-desire clinging\] since that
\[display and ceremony\] is a \[false-\] view of his.42 And that is then
divided in two as rules-and-vows clinging and self-doctrine clinging.
And of these two, rules-and-vows clinging is taught first, being gross,
because it can be recognized on seeing \[it in the forms of\] ox
practice and dog practice. And self-doctrine clinging is taught last
because of its subtlety. This is the "order of teaching."



\[How Craving is a Condition for Clinging\]



[247.] For the first in a single way; But for the three
remaining kinds\
In sevenfold or eightfold way.



[248.] As regards the four kinds of clinging taught in this
way, craving for sense desires is a condition in one way, as
decisive-support, for the first kind, namely, sense-desire clinging,
because it arises in relation to the objective field in which craving
delights. But it is a condition in seven ways, as conascence, mutuality,
support, association, presence, non-disappearance, and root-cause, or in
eight ways, as \[those and\] decisive-support as well, for the remaining
three kinds. And when it is a condition as decisive-support, then it is
never conascent.

[]



[]



This is the detailed explanation of the clause "With craving as
condition,



clinging." \[571\]



\[(X) BECOMING\]



[249.] As to the clause "With clinging as condition, becoming":



\(1\) As to meaning, (2) as to state,\
(3) Purpose, (4) analysis, (5) synthesis,\
(6) And which for which becomes condition,\
The exposition should be known.



[250.] *1.* *As to meaning*: Herein, it becomes (*bhavati*),
thus it is becoming (*bhava*). That is twofold as kamma-process becoming
and rebirth-process becoming, according as it is said: "Becoming in two
ways: there is kamma-process becoming and there is rebirth-process
becoming" (Vibh 137). Herein, the kamma process itself as becoming is
"kamma-process becoming"; likewise the rebirth process itself as
becoming is "rebirth-process becoming." And here, rebirth is becoming
since it becomes; but just as "The arising of Buddhas is bliss" (Dhp
194) is said because it causes bliss, so too kamma should be understood
as "becoming," using for it the ordinary term for its fruit, since it
causes becoming. This, firstly, is how the exposition should be known
here "as to meaning."



[251.] *2.* *As to state*: firstly, kamma-process becoming in
brief is both volition and the states of covetousness, etc., associated
with the volition and reckoned as kamma too, according as it is said:
"Herein, what is kamma-process becoming? The formation of merit, the
formation of demerit, the formation of the imperturbable, either with a
small (limited) plane or with a large (exalted) plane: that is called
kamma-process becoming. Also all kamma that leads to becoming is called
kamma-process becoming" (Vibh 137).



[252.] Here the formation of merit is, in terms of states, the
thirteen kinds of volition ((1)--(13)), the formation of demerit is the
twelve kinds ((22)--(33)), and the formation of the imperturbable is the
four kinds ((14)--(17)). So with the words  *either with a small
(limited) plane or with a large (exalted) plane* the insignificance or
magnitude of these same volitions' result is expressed here. But with
the words *also all kamma that leads to becoming* the covetousness,
etc., associated with volition are expressed.



[253.] Rebirth-process becoming briefly is aggregates generated
by kamma. It is of nine kinds, according as it is said: "Herein, what is
rebirth-process becoming? Sense-desire becoming, fine-material becoming,
immaterial becoming, percipient becoming, non-percipient becoming,
neither-percipient-nor-non-percipient becoming, one-constituent
becoming, \[572\] four-constituent becoming, five- constituent becoming:
this is called rebirth-process becoming" (Vibh 17).



[254.] Herein, the kind of becoming called "having sense
desires" is *sense-desire* *becoming*. Similarly with the
*fine-material* and *immaterial* kinds of becoming. It is the becoming
of those possessed of perception, or there is perception here in
becoming, thus it is *percipient becoming*. The opposite kind is
*non-percipient becoming*. Owing to the absence of gross perception and
to the presence of subtle



[]



[]



perception there is neither perception nor non-perception in that kind
of becoming, thus it is *neither-percipient-nor-non-percipient
becoming*. It is becoming constituted out of the materiality aggregate
only, thus it is *one-constituent becoming*, or that kind of becoming
has only one constituent, \[the materiality aggregate, or dimension,\]
thus it is one-constituent becoming. And similarly the
*four-constituent* \[has the four mental aggregates, or dimensions,\]
and the *five-constituent* \[has the material and the four mental
aggregates, or dimensions\].



[255.] Herein, sense-desire becoming is five aggregates
acquired through kamma (clung to). Likewise the fine-material becoming.
Immaterial becoming is four. Percipient becoming is four and five.
Non-percipient becoming is one aggregate that is acquired through kamma
(clung to). Neither-percipient-nor-non-percipient becoming is four.
One-constituent becoming, etc., are respectively one, four, and five
aggregates as aggregates that are acquired through kamma (clung to).



This is how the exposition should be known here "as to state."



[256.] *3.* *As to purpose*: although formations of merit,
etc., are of course dealt with in the same way in the description of
becoming and in the description of formations (see Vibh 135, 137),
nevertheless the repetition has a purpose. For in the former case it was
because it was a condition, as past kamma, for rebirth- linking here
\[in this becoming\], while in the latter case it is because it is a
condition, as present kamma, for rebirth-linking in the future
\[becoming\]. Or alternatively, in the former instance, in the passage
beginning, "Herein, what is the formation of merit? It is profitable
volition of the sense sphere" (Vibh 135), it was only volitions that
were called "formations"; but here, with the words "All kamma that leads
to becoming" (Vibh 137), the states associated with the volition are
also included. And in the former instance it was only such kamma as is a
condition for consciousness that was called 'formations'; but now also
that which generates non-percipient becoming is included.



[257.] But why so many words? In the clause "With ignorance as
condition there are formations," only profitable and unprofitable states
are expressed as the formation of merit, etc.; but in the clause "With
clinging as condition, becoming," profitable and unprofitable and also
functional states are expressed because of the inclusion of
rebirth-process becoming. So this repetition has a purpose in each case.
This is how the exposition should be known "as to purpose here."



[258.] *4.* *As to analysis*, *synthesis* means as to both the
analysis and the synthesis of becoming that has clinging as its
condition. The kamma with sense-desire clinging as its condition that is
performed and generates sense-desire becoming is "kamma-process
becoming." The aggregates generated by that are "rebirth- process
becoming"; similarly in the case of fine-material and immaterial
becoming. So \[573\] there are two kinds of sense-desire becoming with
sense- desire clinging as condition, included in which are percipient
becoming and five-constituent becoming. And there are two kinds of
fine-material becoming, included in which are percipient,
non-percipient, one-constituent, and five- constituent becoming. And
there are two kinds of immaterial becoming, included in which are
percipient becoming, neither-percipient-nor-non-percipient



[]



[]



becoming, and four-constituent becoming. So, together with what is
included by them, there are six kinds of becoming with sense-desire
clinging as condition. Similarly too with the \[three\] remaining kinds
of clinging as condition. So, as to analysis, there are, together with
what is included by them, twenty-four kinds of becoming with clinging as
condition.



[259.] *As to synthesis*, however, by uniting
kamma-process becoming and rebirth- process becoming there is, together
with what is included by it, one kind of sense-desire becoming with
sense-desire clinging as its condition. Similarly with fine-material and
immaterial becoming. So there are three kinds of becoming. And similarly
with the remaining \[three\] kinds of clinging as condition. So by
synthesis, there are, together with what is included by them, twelve
kinds of becoming with clinging as condition.



[260.] Furthermore, without distinction the kamma with clinging
as its condition that attains sense-desire becoming is kamma-process
becoming. The aggregates generated by that are rebirth-process becoming.
Similarly in the fine-material and immaterial becoming. So, together
with what is included by them, there are two kinds of sense-desire
becoming, two kinds of fine-material becoming, and two kinds of
immaterial becoming. So, by synthesis, there are six kinds of becoming
by this other method. Or again, without making the division into
kamma-process becoming and rebirth-process becoming, there are, together
with what is included by them, three kinds of becoming as sense-desire
becoming, and so on. Or again, without making the division into
sense-desire becoming, etc., there are, together with what is included
by them, two kinds of becoming, as kamma-process becoming and
rebirth-process becoming. And also without making the division into
kamma process and rebirth process there is, according to the words "With
clinging as condition, becoming," only one kind of becoming.



This is how the exposition of becoming with clinging as condition should
be



known here "as to analysis and synthesis."



[261.] *6.* *Which for which becomes condition* means that here
the exposition should be known according to what kind of clinging is a
condition for what \[kind of becoming\]. But what is condition for what
here? Any kind is a condition for any kind. For the ordinary man is like
a madman, and without considering "Is this right or not?" and aspiring
by means of any of the kinds of clinging to any of the kinds of
becoming, he performs any of the kinds of kamma. Therefore when some say
that the fine-material and immaterial kinds of becoming do not come
about through rules-and-vows clinging, that should not be accepted: what
should be accepted is that all kinds come about through all kinds.



[262.] For example, someone thinks in accordance with hearsay
or \[false\] view that sense desires come to be fulfilled in the human
world among the great warrior (*khattiya*) families, etc., and in the
six divine worlds of the sense sphere. \[574\] Misled by listening to
wrong doctrine, etc., and imagining that "by this kamma sense desires
will come to be fulfilled," he performs for the purpose of attaining
them acts of bodily misconduct, etc., through sense-desire clinging. By
fulfilling such misconduct he is reborn in the states of loss. Or he
performs acts of bodily misconduct, etc., aspiring to sense desires
visible here and now



[]



[]



and protecting those he has already acquired. By fulfilling such
misconduct he is reborn in the states of loss. The kamma that is the
cause of rebirth there is kamma-process becoming. The aggregates
generated by the kamma are rebirth- process becoming. But percipient
becoming and five-constituent becoming are included in that, too.



[263.] Another, however, whose knowledge has been intensified
by listening to good Dhamma and so on, imagines that "by this kind of
kamma sense desires will come to be fulfilled." He performs acts of
bodily good conduct, etc., through sense-desire clinging. By fulfilling
such bodily good conduct he is reborn among deities or human beings. The
kamma that is the cause of his rebirth there is kamma-process becoming.
The aggregates generated by the kamma are rebirth- process becoming. But
percipient becoming and five-constituent becoming are included in that,
too.



So sense-desire clinging is a condition for sense-desire becoming with
its



analysis and its synthesis.



[264.] Another hears or conjectures that sense desires come to
still greater perfection in the fine-material and immaterial kinds of
becoming, and through sense-desire clinging he produces the
fine-material and immaterial attainments, and in virtue of his
attainments he is reborn in the fine-material or immaterial
Brahmā-world. The kamma that is the cause of his rebirth there is
kamma-process becoming. The aggregates generated by the kamma are
rebirth-process becoming. But percipient, non-percipient,
neither-percipient-nor-non-percipient, one- constituent,
four-constituent, and five-constituent kinds of becoming are included in
that, too. Thus sense-desire clinging is a condition for fine-material
and immaterial becoming with its analysis and its synthesis.



[265.] Another clings to the annihilation view thus: "This self
comes to be entirely cut off when it is cut off in the fortunate states
of the sense sphere, or in the fine- material or immaterial kinds of
becoming," and he performs kamma to achieve that. His kamma is
kamma-process becoming. The aggregates generated by the kamma are
rebirth-process becoming. But the percipient, etc., kinds of becoming
are included in that too. So \[false-\]view clinging is a condition for
all three, namely, for the sense-desire, fine-material, and immaterial
kinds of becoming with their analysis and their synthesis.



[266.] Another through self-theory clinging thinks, "This self
comes to be blissful, or comes to be free from fever, in the becoming in
the fortunate states in the sense sphere or in one or other of the
fine-material and immaterial kinds of becoming," and he performs kamma
to achieve that. That kamma of his is kamma- process becoming. The
aggregates generated by the kamma are \[575\] rebirth- process becoming.
But the percipient, etc., kinds of becoming are included in that, too.
Thus this self-theory clinging is a condition for all the three, namely,
becoming with their analysis and their synthesis.



[267.] Another \[thinks\] through rules-and-vows clinging,
"This rite and ritual leads him who perfects it to perfect bliss in
becoming in the fortunate states of the sense sphere or in the
fine-material or immaterial kinds of becoming," and he performs kamma to
achieve that. That kamma of his is kamma-process

[]



becoming. The aggregates generated by the kamma are rebirth-process
becoming. But the percipient, etc., kinds of becoming are included in
that, too. So rules-and- vows clinging is a condition for all three,
namely, the sense-desire, fine-material and immaterial kinds of becoming
with their analysis and their synthesis.



This is how the exposition should be known here according to "which is



condition for which."



\[How Clinging is a Condition for Becoming\]



[268.] But which is condition for which kind of becoming in
what way here?



Now, clinging as condition for becoming,\
Both fine-material and immaterial,\
Is decisive-support; and then conascence\
And so on for the sense-desire kind.



[269.]This clinging, though fourfold, is a condition in only
one way as decisive- support condition *for becoming both fine-material
and immaterial*, \[that is,\] for the profitable kamma in the
kamma-process becoming that takes place in sense-desire becoming and for
the rebirth-process becoming. It is a condition, *as conascence and so
on*, that is, as conascence, mutuality, support, association, presence,
non- disappearance, and root-cause conditions, for the unprofitable
kamma-process becoming associated with \[the fourfold clinging\] itself
in the sense-desire becoming. But it is a condition, as decisive-support
only, for that which is dissociated.



This is the detailed explanation of the clause "With clinging as
condition,



becoming."



\[(XI)--(XII) BIRTH, ETC*.*\]



[270.] As regards the clause "With becoming as condition,
birth," etc., the definition of birth should be understood in the way
given in the Description of the Truths (XIV.31ff.)



Only kamma-process becoming is intended here as "becoming"; for it is
that, not rebirth-process becoming, which is a condition for birth. But
it is a condition in two ways, as kamma condition and as
decisive-support condition.



[271.] Here it may be asked: "But how is it to be known that
becoming is a condition for birth?" Because of the observable difference
of inferiority and superiority. For in spite of equality of external
circumstances, such as father, mother, seed, blood, nutriment, etc., the
difference of inferiority and superiority of beings is observable even
in the case of twins. And that fact is not causeless, since it is not
present always and in all; \[576\] nor has it any cause other than
kamma-process becoming since there is no other reason in the internal
continuity of beings generated by it. Consequently, it has only
kamma-process becoming for its cause. And because kamma is the cause of
the difference of inferiority and superiority among beings the Blessed
One said, "It is kamma that separates beings according to inferiority
and superiority" (M III 203). From that it can be known that becoming is
a condition for birth.



[]



[]



[272.]And when there is no birth, neither ageing and death nor
the states beginning with sorrow come about; but when there is birth,
then ageing and death come about, and also the states beginning with
sorrow, which are either bound up with ageing and death in a fool who is
affected by the painful states called ageing and death, or which are not
so bound up in one who is affected by some painful state or other;
therefore this birth is a condition for ageing and death and also for
sorrow and so on. But it is a condition in one way, as decisive-support
type.



This is the detailed explanation of the clause "With becoming as
condition,



birth."



\[SECTION C. THE WHEEL OF BECOMING\]



\[(I) THE WHEEL\]



[273.] Now, here at the end sorrow, etc., are stated.
Consequently, the ignorance stated at the beginning of the Wheel of
Becoming thus, "With ignorance as condition there are formations," is
established by the sorrow and so on. So it should accordingly be
understood that:



Becoming's Wheel reveals no known beginning;\
No maker, no experiencer there;\
Void with a twelvefold voidness, and nowhere\
It ever halts; forever it is spinning.



[274.] But (1) how is ignorance established by sorrow, etc.?
(2) How has this Wheel of Becoming no known beginning? (3) How is there
no maker or experiencer there? (4) How is it void with twelvefold
voidness?



[275.] *1. * Sorrow, grief and despair are inseparable from
ignorance; and lamentation is found in one who is deluded. So, firstly,
when these are established, ignorance is established. Furthermore, "With
the arising of cankers there is the arising of ignorance" (M I 54) is
said, and with the arising of cankers these things beginning with sorrow
come into being. How?



[276.] Firstly, sorrow about separation from sense desires as
object has its arising



in the canker of sense desire, according as it is said:



If, desiring and lusting, his desires elude him,\
He suffers as though an arrow had pierced him (Sn 767),



and according as it is said:



"Sorrow springs from sense desires" (Dhp 215).



[277.] And all these come about with the arising of the canker
of views, according as it is said: "In one who \[577\] possesses \[the
view\] 'I am materiality,' 'my materiality,' with the change and
transformation of materiality there arise sorrow and lamentation, pain,
grief and despair" (S III 3).



[278.] And as with the arising of the canker of views, so also
with the arising of the canker of becoming, according as it is said:
"Then whatever deities there are, long-lived, beautiful, blissful,
long-resident in grand palaces, when they hear the Perfect One's
teaching of the Dhamma, they feel fear, anxiety and a sense of



[]



[]



urgency" (S III 85), as in the case of deities harassed by the fear of
death on seeing the five signs.43



[279.] And as with the arising of the canker of becoming, so
also with the canker of ignorance, according as it is said: "The fool,
bhikkhus, experiences pain and grief here and now in three ways" (M III
163).



Now, these states come about with the arising of cankers, and so when
they are established, they establish the cankers which are the cause of
ignorance. And when the cankers are established, ignorance is also
established because it is present when its condition is present. This,
in the first place, is how ignorance, etc., should be understood to be
established by sorrow and so on.



[280.] *2.* But when ignorance is established since it is
present when its condition is present, and when "with ignorance as
condition there are formations; with formations as condition,
consciousness," there is no end to the succession of cause with fruit in
this way. Consequently, the Wheel of Becoming with its twelve factors,
revolving with the linking of cause and effect, is established as having
"no known beginning."



[281.] This being so, are not the words "With ignorance as
condition there are formations," as an exposition of a simple beginning,
contradicted?---This is not an exposition of a simple beginning. It is
an exposition of a basic state (see §107). For ignorance is the basic
state for the three rounds (see §298). It is owing to his seizing
ignorance that the fool gets caught in the round of the remaining
defilements, in the rounds of kamma, etc., just as it is owing to
seizing a snake's head that the arm gets caught in \[the coils of\] the
rest of the snake's body. But when the cutting off of ignorance is
effected, he is liberated from them just as the arm caught \[in the
coils\] is liberated when the snake's head is cut off, according as it
is said, "With the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance"
(S II 1), and so on. So this is an exposition of the basic state whereby
there is bondage for him who grasps it, and liberation for him who lets
it go: it is not an exposition of a simple beginning.



This is how the Wheel of Becoming should be understood to have no known



beginning. \[578\]



[282.] *3.* This Wheel of Becoming consists in the occurrence
of formations, etc., with ignorance, etc., as the respective reasons.
Therefore it is devoid of a maker supplementary to that, such as a
Brahmā conjectured thus, "Brahmā the Great, the Highest, the Creator" (D
I 18), to perform the function of maker of the round of rebirths; and it
is devoid of any self as an experiencer of pleasure and pain conceived
thus, "This self of mine that speaks and feels" (cf. M I 8). This is how
it should be understood to be without any maker or experiencer.



[283.] *4.* However, ignorance---and likewise the factors
consisting of formations, etc.---is void of lastingness since its nature
is to rise and fall, and it is void of beauty since it is defiled and
causes defilement, and it is void of pleasure since



43\. Their flowers wither, their clothes get dirty, sweat comes from
their armpits, their bodies become unsightly, and they get restless (see
M-a IV 170).



[]



[]



it is oppressed by rise and fall, and it is void of any selfhood
susceptible to the wielding of power since it exists in dependence on
conditions. Or ignorance--- and likewise the factors consisting of
formations, etc.---is neither self nor self's nor in self nor possessed
of self. That is why this Wheel of Becoming should be understood thus,
"Void with a twelvefold voidness."



\[(II) THE THREE TIMES\]



[284.] After knowing this, again:



Its roots are ignorance and craving;\
Its times are three as past and so on,\
To which there properly belong\
Two, eight, and two, from its \[twelve\] factors.



[285.] The two things, ignorance and craving, should be
understood as the root of this Wheel of Becoming. Of the derivation from
the past, ignorance is the root and feeling the end. And of the
continuation into the future, craving is the root and ageing-and-death
the end. It is twofold in this way.



[286.] Herein, the first applies to one whose temperament is
\[false\] view, and the second to one whose temperament is craving. For
in the round of rebirths ignorance leads those whose temperament favours
\[false\] view, and craving those whose temperament favours craving. Or
the first has the purpose of eliminating the annihilation view because,
by the evidence of the fruit, it proves that there is no annihilation of
the causes; and the second has the purpose of eliminating the eternity
view because it proves the ageing and death of whatever has arisen. Or
the first deals with the child in the womb because it illustrates
successive occurrence \[of the faculties\], and the second deals with
one apparitionally born because of \[their\] simultaneous appearance.



[287.] The past, the present and the future are its three
times. Of these, it should be understood that, according to what is
given as such in the texts, the two factors ignorance and formations
belong to the past time, the eight beginning with consciousness belong
to the present time, and the two, birth and ageing- and-death, belong to
the future time. \[579\]



\[(III) CAUSE AND FRUIT\]



[288.]Again, it should be understood thus:



\(1\) It has three links with cause, fruit, cause,\
As first parts; and (2) four different sections;\
(3) Its spokes are twenty qualities;\
(4) With triple round it spins forever.



[289.] *1.* Herein, between formations and rebirth-linking
consciousness there is one link consisting of cause-fruit. Between
feeling and craving there is one link consisting of fruit-cause. And
between becoming and birth there is one link consisting of cause-fruit.
This is how it should be understood *that it has three links with cause,
fruit, cause, as first parts*.



[]



[]



[290.] *2.* But there are four sections, which are determined
by the beginnings and ends of the links, that is to say, ignorance/
formations is one section; consciousness/mentality-materiality/ sixfold
base/contact/feeling is the second; craving/clinging/ becoming is the
third; and birth/ageing-and-death is the fourth. This is how it should
be understood to have *four different sections*.



[291.] *3.* Then:



\(a\) There were five causes in the past,\
(b) And now there is a fivefold fruit;\
(c) There are five causes now as well,\
(d) And in the future fivefold fruit.



It is according to these twenty spokes called "qualities" that the words
*its*



*spokes are twenty qualities* should be understood.



[292.](a) Herein, \[as regards the words\] *There were five
causes in the past*, firstly only these two, namely, ignorance and
formations, are mentioned. But one who is ignorant hankers, and
hankering, clings, and with his clinging as condition there is becoming;
therefore craving, clinging and becoming are included as well. Hence it
is said: "In the previous kamma-process becoming, there is delusion,
which is *ignorance*; there is accumulation, which is *formations*;
there is attachment, which is *craving*; there is embracing, which is
*clinging*; there is volition, which is *becoming*; thus these five
things in the previous kamma-process becoming are conditions for
rebirth-linking here \[in the present becoming\]" (Paṭis I 52).



[293.] Herein,  *In the previous kamma-process becoming* means
in kamma-process becoming done in the previous birth. *There is
delusion, which is ignorance* means that the delusion that there then
was about suffering, etc., deluded whereby the man did the kamma, was
ignorance. *There is accumulation, which is formations* means the prior
volitions arisen in one who prepares the things necessary for a gift
during a month, perhaps, or a year after he has had the thought "I shall
give a gift." \[580\] But it is the volitions of one who is actually
placing the offerings in the recipients' hands that are called
"becoming." Or alternatively, it is the volition that is accumulation in
six of the impulsions of a single adverting that is called "formations,"
and the seventh volition is called "becoming." Or any kind of volition
is called "becoming" and the accumulations associated therewith are
called "formations." *There is attachment, which is craving* means that
in one performing kamma, whatever attachment and aspiration there is for
its fruit as rebirth-process-becoming is called craving. *There is
embracing, which is clinging* means that the embracing, the grasping,
the adherence, which is a condition for kamma-process becoming and
occurs thus, "By doing this I shall preserve, or I shall cut off, sense
desire in such and such a place," is called clinging. *There is
volition, which is becoming* means the kind of volition stated already
at the end of the \[sentence dealing with\] accumulation is becoming.
This is how the meaning should be understood.



[294.](b)  *And now there is a fivefold fruit* (§291) means
what is given in the text beginning with consciousness and ending with
feeling, according as it is said: "Here \[in the present becoming\]
there is rebirth-linking, which is *consciousness*; there is descent
\[into the womb\], which is *mentality-materiality*; there is
sensitivity, which is *sense base*; there is what is touched, which is
*contact*; there is what is felt,



[]



[]



which is *feeling*; thus these five things here in the \[present\]
rebirth-process becoming have their conditions44 in kamma done in the
past" (Paṭis I 52).



[295.] Herein, there is *rebirth-linking*, *which is
consciousness* means that it is what is called "rebirth-linking" because
it arises linking the next becoming that is consciousness. *There is
descent* \[*into the womb*\], *which is mentality-materiality* means
that it is what consists in the descent of the material and immaterial
states into a womb, their arrival and entry as it were, that is
mentality-materiality. *There is sensitivity*, *which is sense base*:
this is said of the five bases beginning with the eye. *There is what is
touched*, *which is contact* means that it is what is arisen when an
object is touched or in the touching of it, that is contact. *There is
what is felt*, *which is feeling* means that it is what is felt as
results \[of kamma\] that is arisen together with rebirth-linking
consciousness, or with the contact that has the sixfold base as its
condition, that is feeling. Thus should the meaning be understood.



[296.] (c)  *There are five causes now as well* (§291) means
craving, and so on. Craving, clinging and becoming are given in the
text. But when becoming is included, the formations that precede it or
that are associated with it are included too. And by including craving
and clinging, the ignorance associated with them, deluded by which a man
performs kamma, is included too. So they are five. Hence it is said:
"Here \[in the present becoming\], with the maturing of the bases there
is delusion, which is *ignorance*; there is accumulation, which is
*formations*; there is attachment, which is *craving*; there is
embracing, which is *clinging*; there is volition, which is *becoming*;
thus these five things here in the \[present\] kamma-process becoming
are conditions for rebirth-linking in the future" (Paṭis I 52). \[581\]



44\. As regards these four paragraphs from the Paṭisambhidā (see §§292,
294, 296, and 297), all four end with the word '*paccayā*' (nom. pl. and
abl. s. of *paccaya* = condition). In the\
first and third paragraphs (§§292 and 296) this is obviously nom. pl.
and agrees with '*ime pañca dhammā*' (these five things). But in the
second and fourth paragraphs the context suggests *vipākā* (results)
instead of conditions. However, there is no doubt that the accepted
reading is *paccayā* here too; for the passage is also quoted in XIX.13,
in the *Sammohavinodanī* (Paccayākāra-Vibhaṅga commentary = present
context), and at M-a I 53. The\
*Paramatthamañjūsā* and *Mūla Þīkā* do not mention this point. The
*Saddhammappakāsinī* (Paṭisambhidā commentary) comments on the first
paragraph: "*Purimakammabhavasmin ti atītajātiyā kammabhave karīyamāne
pavattā; idha paṭisandhiyā paccayā ti paccuppannā paṭisandhiyā
paccayabhūtā,"* and on the second paragraph: *"Idh'upapattibhavasmiṃ
pure katassa kammassa paccayā ti paccuppanne vipākabhave atītajātiyaṃ
katassa kammassa paccayena pavattī ti attho*." The  *Majjhima Nikāya
Þīkā* (M-a I 53) says of the second paragraph: "*Ime paccayā ti ime
viññāṇādayo pañca koṭṭhāsikā dhammā, purimabhave katassa kammassa,
kammavaṭṭassa, paccayā, paccayabhāvato, taṃ paṭicca, idha, etarahi,
upapattibhavasmiṃ upapattibhavabhāvena vā hontī ti attho.*" From these
comments it is plain enough that "*paccayā*" in the second and fourth
paragraphs is taken as abl. sing. (e.g. *avijjā*-*paccayā saṅkhārā).*
There is a parallel ablative construction with genitive at Paṭis II 72,
1.8: "*Gatisampattiyā ñāṇasampayutte aṭṭhannaṃ hetūnaṃ paccayā uppatti
hoti*." Perhaps the literal rendering of the second and fourth
paragraphs' final sentence might be: "Thus there are these five things
here in the \[present\] rebirth-process becoming with their condition
\[consisting\] of kamma done in the past," and so on. The point is
unimportant.



[]



[]



Herein, the words *Here* \[*in the present becoming*\], *with the
maturing of the bases* point out the delusion existing at the time of
the performance of the kamma in one whose bases have matured. The rest
is clear.



[297.](d)  *And in the future fivefold fruit*: the five
beginning with consciousness. These are expressed by the term "birth."
But "ageing-and-death" is the ageing and the death of these \[five\]
themselves. Hence it is said: "In the future there is rebirth-linking,
which is *consciousness*; there is descent \[into the womb\], which is
*mentality-materiality*; there is sensitivity, which is *sense base*;
there is what is touched, which is *contact*; there is what is felt,
which is *feeling*; thus these five things in the future rebirth-process
becoming have their condition in kamma done here \[in the present
becoming\]" (Paṭis I 52).



So this \[Wheel of Becoming\] has twenty spokes with these qualities.



[298.]  *With triple round it spins forever*
(§288): here formations and becoming are the *round of kamma*.
Ignorance, craving and clinging are the *round of defilements*.
Consciousness, mentality-materiality, the sixfold base, contact and
feeling are the *round of result*. So this Wheel of Becoming, having a
triple round with these three rounds, should be understood to spin,
revolving again and again, forever, for the conditions are not cut off
as long as the round of defilements is not cut off.



\[(IV) VARIOUS\]



[299.] As it spins thus:



\(1\) As to the source in the \[four\] truths,\
(2) As to function, (3) prevention, (4) similes,\
(5) Kinds of profundity, and (6) methods,\
It should be known accordingly.



[300.] *1.* Herein, \[*as to source in the truths*:\]
profitable and unprofitable kamma are stated in the Saccavibhaṅga (Vibh
106f.) without distinction as the origin of suffering, and so formations
due to ignorance \[stated thus\] "With ignorance as condition there are
formations" are the second truth with the second truth as source.
Consciousness due to formations is the first truth with the second truth
as source. The states beginning with mentality-materiality and ending
with resultant feeling, due respectively to consciousness, etc., are the
first truth with the first truth as source. Craving due to feeling is
the second truth with the first truth as source.



Clinging due to craving is the second truth with the second truth as
source. Becoming due to clinging is the first and second truths with the
second truth as source. Birth due to becoming is the first truth with
the second truth as source. Ageing-and-death due to birth is the first
truth with the first truth as source. This, in the first place, is how
\[the Wheel of Becoming\] should be known "as to ... source in the four
truths" in whichever way is appropriate.



[301.] *2.*  \[*As to function*:\] ignorance confuses beings
about physical objects \[of sense desire\] and is a condition for the
manifestation of formations; likewise \[kamma-\] formations \[582\] form
the formed and are a condition for consciousness;



[]



[]



consciousness recognizes an object and is a condition for
mentality-materiality; mentality-materiality is mutually consolidating
and is a condition for the sixfold base; the sixfold base occurs with
respect to its own \[separate\] objective fields and is a condition for
contact; contact touches an object and is a condition for feeling;
feeling experiences the stimulus of the object and is a condition for
craving; craving lusts after lust-arousing things and is a condition for
clinging; clinging clings to clinging-arousing things and is a condition
for becoming; becoming flings beings into the various kinds of destiny
and is a condition for birth; birth gives birth to the aggregates owing
to its occurring as their generation and is a condition for
ageing-and-death; and ageing-and-death ensures the decay and dissolution
of the aggregates and is a condition for the manifestation of the next
becoming because it ensures sorrow, etc.45 So this \[Wheel of Becoming\]
should be known accordingly as occurring in two ways "as to function" in
whichever way is appropriate to each of its parts.



[302.] *3.*  \[*As to prevention*:\] the clause "With ignorance
as condition there are formations" prevents seeing a maker; the clause
"With formations as condition, consciousness" prevents seeing the
transmigration of a self; the clause "With consciousness as condition,
mentality-materiality" prevents perception of compactness because it
shows the analysis of the basis conjectured to be "self"; and the
clauses beginning "With mentality-materiality as condition, the sixfold
base" prevent seeing any self that sees, etc., cognizes, touches, feels,
craves, clings, becomes, is born, ages and dies. So this Wheel of
Becoming should be known "as to prevention" of wrong seeing
appropriately in each instance.



[303.] *4.* \[*As to similes*:\] ignorance is like a blind man
because there is no seeing states according to their specific and
general characteristics; formations with ignorance as condition are like
the blind man's stumbling; consciousness with formations as condition is
like the stumbler's falling; mentality-materiality with consciousness as
condition is like the appearance of a tumour on the fallen man; the
sixfold base with mentality-materiality as condition is like a gathering
that makes the tumour burst; contact with the sixfold base as condition
is like hitting the gathering in the tumour; feeling with contact as
condition is like the pain due to the blow; craving with feeling as
condition is like longing for a remedy; clinging with craving as
condition is like seizing what is unsuitable through longing for a
remedy; \[583\] becoming with clinging as condition is like applying the
unsuitable remedy seized; birth with becoming as condition is like the
appearance of a change \[for the worse\] in the tumour owing to the
application of the unsuitable remedy; and ageing-and-death with birth as
condition is like the bursting of the tumour after the change.



Or again, ignorance here as "no theory" and "wrong theory" (see §52)
befogs beings as a cataract does the eyes; the fool befogged by it
involves himself in formations that produce further becoming, as a
cocoon-spinning caterpillar does



45\. "Sorrow, etc., have already been established as ignorance; but
death consciousness itself is devoid of ignorance and formations and is
not a condition for the next becoming; that is why '*because it assures
sorrow, etc.*' is said" (Vism-mhṭ 640).



[]



[]



with the strands of the cocoon; consciousness guided by formations
establishes itself in the destinies, as a prince guided by a minister
establishes himself on a throne; \[death\] consciousness conjecturing
about the sign of rebirth generates mentality-materiality in its various
aspects in rebirth-linking, as a magician does an illusion; the sixfold
base planted in mentality-materiality reaches growth, increase and
fulfilment, as a forest thicket does planted in good soil; contact is
born from the impingement of the bases, as fire is born from the rubbing
together of fire sticks; feeling is manifested in one touched by
contact, as burning is in one touched by fire; craving increases in one
who feels, as thirst does in one who drinks salt water; one who is
parched \[with craving\] conceives longing for the kinds of becoming, as
a thirsty man does for drinks; that is his clinging; by clinging he
clings to becoming as a fish does to the hook through greed for the
bait; when there is becoming there is birth, as when there is a seed
there is a shoot; and death is certain for one who is born, as falling
down is for a tree that has grown up.



So this Wheel of Becoming should be known thus "as to similes" too in



whichever way is appropriate.



[304.] *5.*  \[*Kinds of profundity*:\] Now, the Blessed One's
words, "This dependent origination is profound, Ānanda, and profound it
appears" (D II 55), refer to profundity (a) of meaning, (b) of law, (c)
of teaching, and (d) of penetration. So this Wheel of Becoming should be
known "as to the kinds of profundity" in whichever way is appropriate.



[305.] (a) Herein, the meaning of ageing-and-death produced and
originated with birth as condition is profound owing to difficulty in
understanding its origin with birth as condition thus: Neither does
ageing-and death not come about from birth, nor, failing birth, does it
come about from something else; it arises \[only\] from birth with
precisely that nature \[of ageing-and-death\]. And the meaning of birth
with becoming as condition ... and the meaning of formations produced
and originated with ignorance as condition are treatable in like manner.
That is why this Wheel of Becoming is profound in meaning. This,
firstly, is the profundity of meaning here. \[584\] For it is the fruit
of a cause that is called "meaning," according as it is said, "Knowledge
about the fruit of a cause is the discrimination of meaning" (Vibh 293).



[306.] (b) The meaning of ignorance as condition for formations
is profound since it is difficult to understand in what mode and on what
occasion46 ignorance is a condition for the several formations ... The
meaning of birth as a condition for ageing-and-death is similarly
profound. That is why this Wheel of Becoming is profound in law. This is
the profundity of *law* here. For "law" is a name for cause, according
as it is said, "Knowledge about cause is discrimination of law" (Vibh
293).



[307.] (c) Then the teaching of this \[dependent origination\]
is profound since it needs to be given in various ways for various
reasons, and none but omniscient knowledge gets fully established in it;
for in some places in the suttas it is taught in forward order, in some
in backward order, in some in forward and



[46.]*Avatthā---*"occasion": not in PED.



[]



[]



backward order, in some in forward or in backward order starting from
the middle, in some in four sections and three links, in some in three
sections and two links, and in some in two sections and one link. That
is why this Wheel of Becoming is profound in teaching. This is the
profundity of *teaching*.



[308.] (d) Then the individual essences of ignorance, etc.,
owing to the penetration of which ignorance, etc., are rightly
penetrated as to their specific characteristic, are profound since they
are difficult to fathom. That is why this Wheel of Becoming is profound
in penetration. For here the meaning of ignorance as unknowing and
unseeing and non-penetration of the truth is profound; so is the meaning
of formations as forming and accumulating with and without greed; so is
the meaning of consciousness as void, uninterested, and manifestation of
rebirth-linking without transmigration; so is the meaning of
mentality-materiality as simultaneous arising, as resolved into
components or not, and as bending \[on to an object\] (*namana*) and
being molested (*ruppana*); so is the meaning of the sixfold base as
predominance, world, door, field, and possession of objective field; so
is the meaning of contact as touching, impingement, coincidence, and
concurrence; so is the meaning of feeling as the experiencing of the
stimulus of an object, as pleasure or pain or neutrality, as soulless,
and as what is felt; so is the meaning of craving as a delighting in, as
a committal to, as a current, as a bindweed, as a river, as the ocean of
craving, and as impossible to fill; so is the meaning of clinging as
grasping, seizing, misinterpreting, adhering, and hard to get by; so is
the meaning of becoming as accumulating, forming, and flinging into the
various kinds of generation, destiny, station, and abode; so is the
meaning of birth as birth, coming to birth, descent \[into the womb\],
rebirth, and manifestation; and so is the meaning of ageing- and-birth
as destruction, fall, break-up and change. This is profundity of
*penetration*.



[309.] \[As to methods:\] Then \[585\] there are
four methods of treating the meaning here. They are (a) the method of
identity, (b) the method of diversity, (c) the method of uninterest,47
and (d) the method of ineluctable regularity. So this Wheel of Becoming
should also be known accordingly "as to the kinds of method."48



47\. *Avyāpāra---*"uninterest": here the equivalent of *anābhoga,* see
IV.171 and IX.108. The perhaps unorthodox form "uninterest" has been
used to avoid the "unselfish" sense sometimes implied by
"disinterestedness." *Vyāpāra * is clearly intended throughout this work
as "motivated action" in contrast with "blind action of natural forces."
The word "interest" has therefore been chosen to bring out this effect.



48\. The dependent origination, or structure of conditions, appears as a
flexible formula with the intention of describing the ordinary human
situation of a man in his world (or indeed any conscious event where
ignorance and craving have not entirely ceased). That situation is
always complex, since it is implicit that consciousness with no object,
or being (*bhava---*becoming, or however rendered) without consciousness
(of it), is impossible except as an artificial abstraction. The
dependent origination, being designed to portray the essentials of that
situation in the limited dimensions of words and using only elements
recognizable in experience, is not a logical proposition (Descartes'
*cogito* is not a logical proposition). Nor is it a temporal
cause-and-effect chain: each member has to be examined as to its nature
in order to determine what its relations to



[]



[]



[310.] (a) Herein, the non-interruption of the continuity in
this way, "With ignorance as condition there are formations; with
formations as condition, consciousness," just like a seed's reaching the
state of a tree through the state of the shoot, etc., is called the
"method of identity." One who sees this rightly abandons the
annihilation view by understanding the unbrokenness of the continuity
that occurs through the linking of cause and fruit. And one who sees it
wrongly clings to the eternity view by apprehending identity in the non-
interruption of the continuity that occurs through the linking of cause
and fruit.



[311.] (b) The defining of the individual characteristic of
ignorance, etc., is called the "method of diversity." One who sees this
rightly abandons the eternity view by seeing the arising of each new
state. And one who sees it wrongly clings to



the others are (e.g. whether successive in time or conascent, positive
or negative, etc., etc.). A purely cause-and-effect chain would not
represent the pattern of a situation that is always complex, always
subjective-objective, static-dynamic, positive-negative, and so on.
Again, there is no evidence of any historical development in the various
forms given *within the limit of the Sutta Piṭaka* (leaving aside the
Paṭisambhidāmagga), and historical treatment within that particular
limit is likely to mislead, if it is hypothesis with no foundation.\
Parallels with European thought have been avoided in this translation.
But perhaps an exception can be made here, with due caution, in the case
of Descartes. The revolution in European thought started by his formula
*cogito ergo sum* ("I think, therefore I am") is not yet ended. Now, it
will perhaps not escape notice that the two elements, "I think" and "I
am," in what is not a logical proposition parallel to some extent the
two members of the dependent origination, consciousness and being
(becoming). In other words, consciousness activated by craving and
clinging as the dynamic factory, guided and blinkered by ignorance ("I
think" or "consciousness with the conceit 'I am'"), conditions being
("therefore I am") in a complex relationship with other factors relating
subject and object (not accounted for by Descartes). The parallel should
not be pushed too far. In fact it is only introduced because in Europe
the dependent origination seems to be very largely misunderstood with
many strange interpretations placed upon it, and because the *cogito*
does seem to offer some sort of reasonable approach. In this work, for
convenience because of the special importance attached here to the
aspect of the death-rebirth link, the dependent origination is
considered from only one standpoint, namely, as applicable to a period
embracing a minimum of three lives. But this is not the only
application. With suitable modifications it is also used in the Vibhaṅga
to describe the structure of the complex in each one of the 89 single
type- consciousnesses laid down in the *Dhammasaṅgaṇī*; and
Bhadantācariya Buddhaghosa says: "This structure of conditions is
present not only in (a continuity period consisting of) multiple
consciousnesses but also in each single consciousness as well" (Vibh-a
199--200). Also the Paṭisambhidāmagga gives five expositions, four
describing dependent origination in one life, the fifth being made to
present a special inductive generalization to extend what is observable
in this life (the fact that consciousness is always preceded by
consciousness, cf. this Ch. §83f.---i.e. that it always has a past and
is inconceivable without one) back beyond birth, and (since craving and
ignorance ensure its expected continuance) on after death. There are,
besides, various other, differing applications indicated by the variant
forms given in the suttas themselves.

[]



the annihilation view by apprehending individual diversity in the events
in a single continuity as though it were a broken continuity.



[312.] (c) The absence of interestedness on the part of
ignorance, such as "Formations must be made to occur by me," or on the
part of formations, such as "Consciousness must be made to occur by us,"
and so on, is called the "method of uninterestedness." One who sees this
rightly abandons the self view by understanding the absence of a maker.
One who sees it wrongly clings to the moral-inefficacy-of-action view,
because he does not perceive that the causative function of ignorance,
etc., is established as a law by their respective individual essences.



[313.] (d) The production of only formations, etc.,
respectively and no others with ignorance, etc., as the respective
reasons, like that of curd, etc., with milk, etc., as the respective
reasons, is called the "method of ineluctable regularity." One who sees
this rightly abandons the no-cause view and the moral-inefficacy-
of-action view by understanding how the fruit accords with its
condition. One who sees it wrongly by apprehending it as non-production
of anything from anything, instead of apprehending the occurrence of the
fruit in accordance with its conditions, clings to the no-cause view and
to the doctrine of fatalism. So this Wheel of Becoming:



As to source in the \[four\] truths,\
As to function, prevention, similes,\
Kinds of profundity, and methods,\
Should be known accordingly.



[314.] There is no one, even in a dream, who has got out of the
fearful round of rebirths, which is ever destroying like a thunderbolt,
unless he has severed with the knife of knowledge well whetted on the
stone of sublime concentration, this Wheel of Becoming, which offers no
footing owing to its great profundity and is hard to get by owing to the
maze of many methods. \[586\]



And this has been said by the Blessed One: "This dependent origination
is profound, Ānanda, and profound it appears. And, Ānanda, it is through
not knowing, through not penetrating it, that this generation has become
a tangled skein, a knotted ball of thread, root-matted as a reed bed,
and finds no way out of the round of rebirths, with its states of loss,
unhappy destinies, ... perdition" (D II 55).



Therefore, practicing for his own and others' benefit and welfare, and



abandoning other duties:



Let a wise man with mindfulness\
So practice that he may begin\
To find a footing in the deeps\
Of the dependent origin.

## CHAPTER XVIII 


PURIFICATION OF VIEW



(*Diṭṭhi-visuddhi-niddesa*)



[1.]\[587\] Now, it was said earlier (XIV.32) that he "should
first fortify his knowledge by learning and questioning about those
things that are the 'soil' after he has perfected the two
purifications---purification of virtue and purification of
consciousness---that are the 'roots.'" Now, of those, purification of
virtue is the quite purified fourfold virtue beginning with Pātimokkha
restraint; and that has already been dealt with in detail in the
Description of Virtue; (Chs. I and II) and the purification of
consciousness, namely, the eight attainments together with access
concentration, has also been dealt with in detail in all its aspects in
the Description of Concentration, (Chs. III to XIII) stated under the
heading of "consciousness" \[in the introductory verse\]. So those two
purifications should be understood in detail as given there.



[2.] But it was said above (XIV.32) that "The five
purifications, purification of view, purification by overcoming doubt,
purification by knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not
the path, purification by knowledge and vision of the way, and
purification by knowledge and vision, are the 'trunk.'" Herein,
"purification of view" is the correct seeing of mentality-materiality.1



\[DEFINING  OF  MENTALITY-MATERIALITY\]



\[(1) DEFINITION BASED ON THE FOUR PRIMARIES\]



\[(a) Starting with Mentality\]



[3.]One who wants to accomplish this, if, firstly, his vehicle
is serenity,2 should emerge from any fine-material or immaterial jhāna,
except the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception,3
and he should discern, according to



1\. "Mentality should be taken here as the four aggregates beginning
with feeling and belonging to the three planes, not omitting
consciousness as in the case of 'With consciousness as condition,
mentality-materiality' and not including the supramundane aggregates
associated with Nibbāna" (Vism-mhṭ 744 (Be)).\



2\. Serenity (*samatha*) is a general term for concentration, as the
complement of insight (*vipassanā*), which is roughly the equivalent of
understanding (*paññā*).



3\. "One who is beginning this work has difficulty in discerning the
highest form of becoming, that is, the base consisting of neither
perception nor non-perception" (Vism- mhṭ 744). This is owing to the
diminished perception (see M III 28).


[]



[]



characteristic, function, etc., the jhāna factors consisting of applied
thought, etc., and the states associated with them, \[that is, feeling,
perception, and so on\]. When he has done so, all that should be defined
as "mentality" (*nāma*) in the sense of bending (*namana*)4 because of
its bending on to the object.



[4.]Then, just as a man, by following a snake that he has seen
in his house, finds its abode, so too this meditator scrutinizes that
mentality, he seeks to find out what its occurrence is supported by and
he sees that it is supported \[588\] by the matter of the heart. After
that, he discerns as materiality the primary elements, which are the
heart's support, and the remaining, derived kinds of materiality that
have the elements as their support. He defines all that as "materiality"
(*rūpa*) because it is "molested" (*ruppana*) \[by cold, etc.\]. After
that he defines in brief as "mentality-materiality" (*nāma*-*rūpa*) the
mentality that has the characteristic of "bending" and the materiality
that has the characteristic of "being molested."



\[(b) Starting with Materiality\]



[5.]But one whose vehicle is pure insight, or that same
aforesaid one whose vehicle is serenity, discerns the four elements in
brief or in detail in one of the various ways given in the chapter on
the definition of the four elements (XI.27ff.). Then, when the elements
have become clear in their correct essential characteristics,
firstly*, * in the case of head hair originated by kamma there become
plain ten instances of materiality (*rūpāni*) with the body decad thus:
the four elements, colour, odour, flavour, nutritive essence, and life,
and body sensitivity. And because the sex decad is present there too
there are another ten \[that is, the same nine with sex instead of body
sensitivity\]. And since the octad-with-nutritive-essence-as-eighth
\[that is, the four elements and colour, odour, flavour, and nutritive
essence,\] originated by nutriment, and that originated by temperature,
and that originated by consciousness are present there too, there are
another twenty-four. So there is a total of forty-four instances of
materiality in the case of each of the twenty-four bodily parts of
fourfold origination. But in the case of the four, namely, sweat, tears,
spittle, and snot,5 which are originated



4\. See S II 23f. "Bending in the direction of the object means that
there is no occurrence without an object; it is in the sense of that
sort of bending, or it is in the sense of bestowing a name
(*nāma*-*karaṇa*)" (Vism-mhṭ 744). "Name-and-form" has many advantages
over "mentality-materiality" if only because it preserves the integrity
of *nāma * and excludes any metaphysical assumption of matter existing
as a substance behind apparent forms.\



5\. "Because sweat, etc., arise owing to heat, fatigue, etc., and owing
to mental perturbation, they are called 'originated by temperature and
by consciousness'" (Vism- mhṭ 745). There are seven kinds of decads:
those of the physical basis of mind (heart), sex, living, physical eye,
ear, nose, tongue, and body. The first nine components of a decad are
the same in all instances, and by themselves they are called the "life
ennead." The first eight components by themselves are called the
"octad-with-nutritive-essence- as-eighth." This octad plus sound is
called the "sound ennead." In general these are called "material groups"
(*rūpa*-*kalāpa*). But this kind of group (*kalāpa*) has nothing to do
with the "comprehension by groups" (*kalāpa*-*sammasana*) of Ch. XX,
which is simply generalization (from one's own particular experience to
each of the five aggregates as past, etc., i.e. as a "group"). The
"material groups" are not in the Piṭakas.



[]



[]



by temperature and by consciousness, there are sixteen instances of
materiality with the two octads-with-nutritive-essence-as-eighth in
each. In the case of the four, namely, gorge, dung, pus, and urine,
which are originated by temperature, eight instances of materiality
become plain in each with the octad-with-nutritive-essence- as-eighth in
what is originated only by temperature. This, in the first place, is the
method in the case of the thirty-two bodily aspects.



[6.] But there are ten more aspects6 that become clear when
those thirty-two aspects have become clear. And as regards these,
firstly, nine instances of materiality, that is, the
octad-with-nutritive-essence-as-eighth plus life, become plain in the
case of the kamma-born part of heat (fire) that digests what is eaten,
etc., and likewise nine \[instances of materiality\], that is, the
octad-with-nutritive- essence-as-eighth plus sound, in the case of the
consciousness-born part \[of air consisting\] of in-breaths and
out-breaths; and thirty-three instances of materiality, that is, the
\[kamma-born\] life-ennead and the three octads-with-nutritive-essence-
as-eighth in the case of each of the remaining eight \[parts\] that are
of fourfold origination.



[7.] And when these instances of materiality derived \[by
clinging\] from the primaries have thus become plain in detail in the
case of these forty-two aspects, \[that is, thirty-two parts of the
body, four modes of fire, and six modes of air,\] another sixty
instances of materiality become plain with the physical \[heart-\] basis
and the \[five\] sense doors, that is, with the heart-basis decad and
the five decads beginning with the eye decad.



Taking all these together under the characteristic of "being molested,"
he



sees them as "materiality."



[8.]When he has discerned materiality thus, the immaterial
states become plain to him in accordance with the sense doors, that is
to say, the eighty-one kinds7 of mundane consciousness consisting of the
two sets of five consciousnesses ((34)-- (38) and (50)--(54)), the three
kinds of mind element ((39), (55) and (70)) and the sixty-eight \[589\]
kinds of mind-consciousness element; and then seven
consciousness-concomitants, that is, (i) contact, feeling, perception,
(ii) volition, (vii) life, (viii) steadiness of consciousness, and (xxx)
attention, which are invariably conascent with all these
consciousnesses. The supramundane kinds of consciousness, however, are
not discernible either by one who is practicing pure insight or by one
whose vehicle is serenity because they are out of their reach. Taking
all these immaterial states together under the characteristic of
"bending," he sees them as "mentality."



This is how one \[meditator\] defines mentality-materiality in detail
through



the method of defining the four elements.



6\. The ten are four aspects of the fire element and six aspects of the
air element; what heats, what consumes, what burns up, what digests;
up-going winds (or forces), down-going winds, winds in the stomach,
winds in the bowels, winds in the limbs, breath. See XI.37, 82.\



7\. "The exalted consciousness of the fine-material and immaterial
spheres is only quite plain to one who has attained the attainments"
(Vism-mhṭ 746).



[]



[]



\[(2) DEFINITION BASED ON THE EIGHTEEN ELEMENTS\]



[9.]Another does it by means of the eighteen elements. How?
Here a bhikkhu considers the elements thus: "There are in this person
the eye element, ... the mind-consciousness element." Instead of taking
the piece of flesh variegated with white and black circles, having
length and breath, and fastened in the eye socket with a string of
sinew, which the world terms "an eye," he defines as "eye element" the
eye sensitivity of the kind described among the kinds of derived
materiality in the Description of the Aggregates (XIV.47).



[10.] But he does not define as "eye element" the remaining
instances of materiality, which total fifty-three, that is, the nine
conascent instances of materiality consisting of the four primary
elements, which are its support, the four concomitant instances of
materiality, namely, colour, odour, flavour, and nutritive essence, and
the sustaining life faculty; and also the twenty kamma- born instances
of materiality that are there too, consisting of the body decad and sex
decad; and the twenty-four unclung-to instances of materiality
consisting of the three octads-with-nutritive-essence-as-eighth, which
are originated by nutriment and so on. The same method applies to the
ear element and the rest. But in the case of the body element the
remaining instances of materiality total forty-three, though some say
forty-five by adding sound and making nine each for the temperature-born
and consciousness-born \[sound\].



[11.]So these five sensitivities, and their five respective
objective fields, that is, visible data, sounds, odours, flavours, and
tangible data, make ten instances of materiality, which are ten \[of the
eighteen\] elements. The remaining instances of materiality are the
mental-data element only.



The consciousness that occurs with the eye as its support and contingent
upon a visible datum is called "eye-consciousness element" \[and
likewise with the ear and so on\]. In this way the two sets of five
consciousnesses are the five "consciousness elements." The three kinds
of consciousness consisting of mind element ((39), (55) and (70)) are
the single "mind element." The sixty-eight kinds of mind-consciousness
element are the "mind-consciousness element." So all the eighty-one
kinds of mundane consciousness make up seven kinds of consciousness
element; and the contact, etc., associated therewith are the mental-
data element.



So ten-and-a-half elements are materiality and seven-and-a-half elements
\[590\] are mentality. This is how one \[meditator\] defines
mentality-materiality by means of the eighteen elements.



\[(3) DEFINITION BASED ON THE TWELVE BASES\]



[12.] Another does it by means of the twelve bases. How? He
defines as "eye base" the sensitivity only, leaving out the fifty-three
remaining instances of materiality, in the way described for the eye
element. And in the way described there \[he also defines\] the elements
of the ear, nose, tongue, and body, as "ear base, nose base, tongue
base, body base." He defines five states that are their respective
objective fields as "visible-data base, sound base, odour base, flavour
base, tangible-data base." He defines the seven mundane consciousness
elements



[]



[]



as "mind base." He defines the contact, etc., associated there with and
also the remaining instances of materiality as "mental-data base." So
here ten-and-a- half bases are materiality and one-and-a-half bases are
mentality. This is how one \[meditator\] defines mentality-materiality
by means of the twelve bases.



\[(4) DEFINITION BASED ON THE FIVE AGGREGATES\]



[13.]Another defines it more briefly than that by means of the
aggregates. How? Here a bhikkhu defines as "the materiality aggregate"
all the following twenty- seven instances of materiality, that is, the
seventeen instances of materiality consisting of the four primaries of
fourfold origination in this body and dependent colour, odour, flavour,
and nutritive essence, and the five sensitivities beginning with the eye
sensitivity, and the materiality of the physical \[heart- \]basis, sex,
life faculty, and sound of twofold origination, which seventeen
instances of materiality are suitable for comprehension since they are
produced and are instances of concrete materiality; and then the ten
instances of materiality, that is, bodily intimation, verbal intimation,
the space element, and the lightness, malleability, wieldiness, growth,
continuity, aging, and impermanence of materiality, which ten instances
of materiality are, however, not suitable for comprehension since they
are merely the mode-alteration and the limitation-of- interval; they are
not produced and are not concrete materiality, but they are reckoned as
materiality because they are mode-alterations, and limitation-of-
interval, of various instances of materiality. So he defines all these
twenty-seven instances of materiality as the "the materiality
aggregate." He defines the feeling that arises together with the
eighty-one kinds of mundane consciousness as the "feeling aggregate,"
the perception associated therewith as the "perception aggregate," the
formations associated therewith as the "formations aggregate," and the
consciousness as the "consciousness aggregate." So by defining the
materiality aggregate as "materiality" and the four immaterial
aggregates as "mentality," he defines mentality-materiality by means of
the five aggregates.



\[(5) BRIEF DEFINITION BASED ON THE FOUR PRIMARIES\]



[14.] Another discerns "materiality" in his person briefly
thus: "Any kind of materiality whatever all consists of the four primary
elements and the materiality derived from the four primary elements" (M
I 222), and he likewise discerns the mind base and a part of the mental
data base as "mentality." Then he defines mentality-materiality in brief
thus: "This mentality and this materiality are called
'mentality-materiality.'" 8



8\. "As well as by means of the elements, etc., materiality can also be
discerned through the faculties, the truths, and the dependent
origination. How? "Firstly, through the faculties. These seven, namely,
the five beginning with the eye plus femininity and masculinity are
materiality; the eleven consisting of the mind faculty, the five feeling
faculties, and the five beginning with faith, are mentality; the life
faculty is both mentality and materiality. The last three, being
supramundane, are not intended here. The truth of suffering is both
mentality and materiality; the truth of origin is mentality; the other
two are not intended here because they are supramundane. "In the
structure of conditions, the first three members are mentality; the
fourth and



[]

\[IF  THE IMMATERIAL FAILS  TO BECOME EVIDENT\]



[15.]\[591\] But if he has discerned materiality in one of
these ways, and while he is trying to discern the immaterial it does not
become evident to him owing to its subtlety, then he should not give up
but should again and again comprehend, give attention to, discern, and
define materiality only. For in proportion as materiality becomes quite
definite, disentangled and quite clear to him, so the immaterial states
that have that \[materiality\] as their object become plain of
themselves too.



[16.]Just as, when a man with eyes looks for the reflection of
his face in a dirty looking-glass and sees no reflection, he does not
throw the looking-glass away because the reflection does not appear; on
the contrary, he polishes it again and again, and then the reflection
becomes plain of itself when the looking-glass is clean---and just as,
when a man needing oil puts sesame flour in a basin and wets it with
water and no oil comes out with only one or two pressings, he does not
throw the sesame flour away; but on the contrary, he wets it again and
again with hot water and squeezes and presses it, and as he does so
clear sesame oil comes out---or just as, when a man wanting to clarify
water has taken a *katuka* nut and put his hand inside the pot and
rubbed it once or twice but the water does not come clear, he does not
throw the *katuka* nut away; on the contrary, he rubs it again and
again, and as he does so the fine mud subsides and the water becomes
transparent and clear---so too, the bhikkhu should not give up, but he
should again and again comprehend, give attention to, discern and define
materiality only.



[17.]For in proportion as materiality becomes quite definite,
disentangled and quite clear to him, so the defilements that are
opposing him subside, his consciousness becomes clear like the water
above the \[precipitated\] mud, and the immaterial states that have that
\[materiality\] as their object become plain of themselves too. And this
meaning can also be explained in this way by other analogies such as the
\[pressing of\] sugarcane, \[the beating of\] criminals \[to make them
confess\], \[the taming of\] an ox, the churning of curds \[to produce
butter\], and \[the cooking of\] fish.



\[HOW  THE  IMMATERIAL  STATES  BECOME  EVIDENT\]



[18.] When he has quite cleared up his discerning of
materiality, then the immaterial states become evident to him through
one of three aspects, that is, through contact, through feeling, or
through consciousness. How?



[19.]*1. (a)* When he discerns the \[four primary\] elements in
the way beginning, "The earth element has the characteristic of
hardness" (XI.93), contact becomes evident to him as the first
conjunction. Then the feeling associated with that as the feeling
aggregate, the associated perception as the perception aggregate, the
associated volition together with the aforesaid contact as the
formations aggregate, and the associated consciousness as the
consciousness aggregate.



fifth are mentality and materiality; the sixth, seventh, eighth, and
ninth are mentality; the tenth is both mentality and materiality; the
last two are each mentality and materiality" (Vism-mhṭ 747f.).



[]



[]



*1. (b)* \[592\] Likewise \[when he has discerned them in this way,\]
"In the head hair it is the earth element that has the characteristic of
hardness ... in the in- breaths and out-breaths it is the earth element
that has the characteristic of hardness" (XI.31), contact becomes
evident as the first conjunction. Then the feeling associated with it as
the feeling aggregate, ... the associated consciousness as the
consciousness aggregate.



This is how immaterial states become evident through contact.



[20.] *2. (a)* To another \[who discerns the four primary
elements in the way beginning\] "The earth element has the
characteristic of hardness," the feeling that has that as its object and
experiences its stimulus \[as pleasant, etc.,\] becomes evident as the
feeling aggregate, the perception associated with that as the perception
aggregate, the contact and the volition associated with that as the
formations aggregate, and the consciousness associated with that as the
consciousness aggregate.



*2. (b)* Likewise \[to one who discerns them in this way\] "In the head
hair it is the earth element that has the characteristic of hardness ...
in the in-breaths and out-breaths it is the earth element that has the
characteristic of hardness," the feeling that has that as its object and
experiences its stimulus becomes evident as the feeling aggregate ...
and the consciousness associated with that as the consciousness
aggregate.



This is how the immaterial states become evident through feeling.



[21.] *3. (a)* To another \[who discerns the four primary
elements in the way beginning\] "The earth element has the
characteristic of hardness," the consciousness that cognizes the object
becomes evident as the consciousness aggregate, the feeling associated
with it as the feeling aggregate, the associated perception as the
perception aggregate, and the associated contact and volition as the
formations aggregate.



*3. (b)* Likewise \[to one who discerns them in this way\] "In the head
hair it is the earth element that has the characteristic of hardness ...
in the in-breaths and out-breaths it is the earth element that has the
characteristic of hardness," the consciousness that cognizes the object
becomes evident as the consciousness aggregate ... and the associated
contact and volition as the formations aggregate.



This is how the immaterial states become evident through consciousness.



[22.]In the case of \[the ways of discerning materiality as
consisting of\] the forty- two aspects of the elements beginning with
the head hairs \[that is, thirty-two aspects of the body, four aspects
of the fire element and six aspects of the air element,\] either by
these same means given above or by means of the method beginning, "In
the kamma-originated head hairs it is the earth element that has the
characteristic of hardness---and also in the case of the methods of
discerning materiality as consisting of the eye, etc.---by means of the
four primary elements in each, the construing should be done by working
out all the differences in each method.



[23.]Now, it is only when he has become quite sure about
discerning materiality in this way that immaterial states become quite
evident to him in the three aspects.



[]



[]



Therefore he should only undertake the task of discerning the immaterial
states after he has completed that, not otherwise. If he leaves off
discerning materiality when, say, one or two material states have become
evident in order to begin discerning the immaterial, then he falls from
his meditation subject like the mountain cow already described under the
Development of the Earth Kasiṇa (IV.130). \[593\] But if he undertakes
the task of discerning the immaterial after he is already quite sure
about discerning materiality thus, then his meditation subject comes to
growth, increase and perfection.



\[NO  BEING  APART  FROM  MENTALITY-MATERIALITY\]



[24.]He defines the four immaterial aggregates that have thus
become evident through contact, etc., as "mentality." And he defines
their objects, namely, the four primaries and the materiality derived
from the four primaries, as "materiality." So, as one who opens a box
with a knife, as one who splits a twin palmyra bulb in two, he defines
all states of the three planes,9 the eighteen elements, twelve bases,
five aggregates, in the double way as "mentality- materiality," and he
concludes that over and above mere mentality-materiality there is
nothing else that is a being or a person or a deity or a Brahmā.



[25.]After defining mentality-materiality thus according to its
true nature, then in order to abandon this worldly designation of "a
being" and "a person" more thoroughly, to surmount confusion about
beings and to establish his mind on the plane of non-confusion, he makes
sure that the meaning defined, namely,



9\. "'*All states of the three planes*' is said all-inclusively owing to
the necessity not to omit anything suitable for comprehension. For it
must be fully understood without any exception, and greed must be made
to fade away absolutely so that the mind may be liberated by the fading
away of greed. That is why the Blessed One said: 'Bhikkhus, without
directly knowing, without fully understanding all, without causing the
fading away of greed for it, without abandoning it, the mind is
incapable of the destruction of suffering. Bhikkhus, it is by directly
knowing, by fully understanding all, by causing the fading away of greed
for it, by abandoning it, that the mind is capable of the destruction of
suffering'* * (S IV 17). If all the states of the three planes are taken
as mentality-materiality without exception, then how should one deal
with what has been conceived by those outside the Dispensation as verbal
meanings, such as the Primordial Essence (*pakati*), etc. \[e.g. of the
Sāṃkhya\], the substance (*drabya*), etc. \[e.g. of the Vaiøeåika\], the
soul (*jīva*), etc., and the body (*kāya*), etc. \[?\] Since these are
like the hallucination of lunatics and are taught by the not fully
enlightened, what other way of dealing with them is there than to ignore
them? Or alternatively, their existence or non-existence can be
understood as established by their inclusion within mentality-
materiality" (Vism-mhṭ 751f.). There follows a long paragraph showing
how the concepts of these systems are to be assimilated into
mentality-materiality whereby they lose their significance and are shown
to be impermanent and formed. Vism-mhṭ concludes by saying, "Wherever
the verbal meaning of self is expressed by some such metaphor as
world-soul (*purisa*), self (*attā*, *ātman*), soul (*jīva*), etc.,
these being themselves conceived in their various ways on the basis of
mere mentality-materiality, are mere mentality-materiality, too"
(Vism-mhṭ 754f.).



[]



[]



"This is mere mentality-materiality, there is no being, no person" is
confirmed by a number of suttas. For this has been said:



As with the assembly of parts\
The word "chariot" is countenanced,\
So, when the aggregates are present,\
"A being" is said in common usage (S I 135).



[26.]Again, this has been said: "Just as when a space is
enclosed with timber and creepers and grass and clay, there comes to be
the term 'house,' so too, when a space is enclosed with bones and sinews
and flesh and skin, there comes to be the term 'material form' (*rūpa*)"
(M I 190).



[27.] And again this has been said:



It is ill alone that rises,\
Ill that remains, ill that departs.\
Nothing rises else than ill,\
And nothing ceases else than ill (S I 135).



[28.]So in many hundred suttas it is only mentality-materiality
that is illustrated, not a being, not a person. Therefore, just as when
the component parts such as axles, wheels, frame poles, etc., are
arranged in a certain way, there comes to be the mere term of common
usage "chariot," yet in the ultimate sense when each part is examined
there is no chariot---and just as when the component parts of a house
such as wattles, etc., are placed so that they enclose a space in a
certain way, there comes to be the mere term of common usage "house,"
yet in the ultimate sense there is no house---and just as when the
fingers, thumb, etc., are placed in a certain way, there comes to be the
mere term of common usage \[594\] "fist,"--- with body and strings,
"lute"; with elephants, horses, etc., "army"; with surrounding walls,
houses, states, etc., "city"---just as when trunk, branches, foliage,
etc., are placed in a certain way, there comes to be the mere term of
common usage "tree," yet in the ultimate sense, when each component is
examined, there is no tree---so too, when there are the five aggregates
\[as objects\] of clinging, there comes to be the mere term of common
usage "a being," "a person," yet in the ultimate sense, when each
component is examined, there is no being as a basis for the assumption
"I am" or "I"; in the ultimate sense there is only
mentality-materiality. The vision of one who sees in this way is called
correct vision.



[29.]But when a man rejects this correct vision and assumes
that a \[permanent\] being exists, he has to conclude either that it
comes to be annihilated or that it does not. If he concludes that it
does not come to be annihilated, he falls into the eternity \[view\]. If
he concludes that it does come to be annihilated, he falls into the
annihilation \[view\]. Why? Because \[the assumption\] precludes any
gradual change like that of milk into curd. So he either holds back,
concluding that the assumed being is eternal, or he overreaches,
concluding that it comes to be annihilated.



[30.]Hence the Blessed One said: "There are two kinds of view,
bhikkhus, and when deities and human beings are obsessed by them, some
hold back and



[]



[]



some overreach; only those with eyes see. And how do some hold back?
Deities and human beings love becoming, delight in becoming, rejoice in
becoming. When Dhamma is taught to them for the ceasing of becoming,
their minds do not enter into it, become settled, steady and resolute.
Thus it is that some hold back. And how do some overreach? Some are
ashamed, humiliated and disgusted by that same becoming, they are
concerned with non-becoming in this way: 'Sirs, when with the breakup of
the body this self is cut off, annihilated, does not become any more
after death, that is peaceful, that is sublime, that is true.' Thus it
is that some overreach. And how do those with eyes see? Here a bhikkhu
sees what is become as become. Having seen what is become as become, he
has entered upon the way to dispassion for it, to the fading away of
greed for it, to its cessation. This is how one with eyes sees" (It 43;
Paṭis I 159).



[31.]Therefore, just as a marionette is void, soulless and
without curiosity, and while it walks and stands merely through the
combination of strings and wood, \[595\] yet it seems as if it had
curiosity and interestedness, so too, this mentality- materiality is
void, soulless and without curiosity, and while it walks and stands
merely through the combination of the two together, yet it seems as if
it had curiosity and interestedness. This is how it should be regarded.
Hence the Ancients said:



The mental and material are really here,\
But here there is no human being to be found,\
For it is void and merely fashioned like a doll---\
Just suffering piled up like grass and sticks.



\[INTERDEPENDENCE  OF  MENTALITY  AND  MATERIALITY\]



[32.] And this should be explained not only by means of the
simile of the marionette, but also by means of the analogies of the
sheaves of reeds and so on. For just as when two sheaves of reeds are
propped one against the other, each one gives the other consolidating
support, and when one falls the other falls, so too, in the
five-constituent becoming mentality-materiality occurs as an
interdependent state, each of its components giving the other
consolidating support, and when one falls owing to death, the other
falls too. Hence the Ancients said:



The mental and material\
Are twins and each supports the other;\
When one breaks up they both break up\
Through interconditionality.



[33.]And just as when sound occurs having as its support a drum
that is beaten by the stick, then the drum is one and the sound another,
the drum and the sound are not mixed up together, the drum is void of
the sound and the sound is void of the drum, so too, when mentality
occurs having as its support the materiality called the physical basis,
the door and the object, then the materiality is one and the mentality
is another, the mentality and materiality are not mixed up together, the
mentality is void of the materiality and the materiality is void of



[]



[]



the mentality; yet the mentality occurs due to the materiality as the
sound occurs due to the drum. Hence the Ancients said:



The pentad based on contact comes not from the eye,\
Or from things seen, or something that is in between;\
Due to a cause it comes to be, and formed as well.\
Just as the sound that issues from a beaten drum.



The pentad based on contact comes not from the ear.\
Or yet from sound, or something that is in between;\
Due to a cause ...\
The pentad based on contact comes not from the nose



Or yet from smells, or something that is in between;\
Due to a cause ...\
The pentad based on contact comes not from the tongue,\
Or yet from tastes, or something that is in between; \[596\]



Due to a cause ...\
The pentad based on contact comes not from the body,\
Or yet from touch, or something that is in between;\
Due to a cause ...



Being formed*,* it does not come from the material basis*.* Nor does it
issue from the mental-datum base;\
Due to a cause it comes to be*,* and formed as well*.* Just as the sound
that issues from a beaten drum.



[34.]Furthermore, mentality has no efficient power, it cannot
occur by its own efficient power. It does not eat, it does not drink, it
does not speak, it does not adopt postures. And materiality is without
efficient power; it cannot occur by its own efficient power. For it has
no desire to eat, it has no desire to drink, it has no desire to speak,
it has no desire to adopt postures. But rather it is when supported by
materiality that mentality occurs; and it is when supported by mentality
that materiality occurs. When mentality has the desire to eat, the
desire to drink, the desire to speak, the desire to adopt a posture, it
is materiality that eats, drinks, speaks, and adopts a posture.



[35.]But for the purpose of explaining this meaning they gave
this simile as an example: a man born blind and a stool-crawling cripple
wanted to go somewhere. The blind man said to the cripple, "Look, I can
do what should be done by legs, but I have no eyes with which to see
what is rough and smooth." The cripple said, "Look, I can do what should
be done by eyes, but I have no legs with which to go and come." The
blind man was delighted, and he made the cripple climb up on his
shoulder. Sitting on the blind man's shoulder the cripple spoke thus,
"Leave the left, take the right; leave the right, take the left."



Herein, the blind man has no efficient power; he is impotent; he cannot
travel by his own efficient power, by his own strength. And the cripple
has no efficient power; he is impotent; he cannot travel by his own
efficient power, by his own strength. But there is nothing to prevent
their going when they support each other. So too, mentality has no
efficient power; it does not arise or occur in such



[]



[]



and such functions by its own efficient power. And materiality has no
efficient power; it does not arise or occur in such and such functions
by its own efficient power.



But there is nothing to prevent their occurrence when they support each



other.



[36.] Hence this is said:



They cannot come to be by their own strength,\
Or yet maintain themselves by their own strength;\
Relying for support on other states,\
Weak in themselves, and formed, they come to be; \[597\]



They come to be with others as condition.\
They are aroused by others as their objects,\
They are produced by object and condition,\
And each by something other than itself.



And just as men depend upon\
A boat for traversing the sea.\
So does the mental body need\
The matter-body for occurrence.



And as the boat depends upon\
The men for traversing the sea.\
So does the matter-body need\
The mental body for occurrence.



Depending each upon the other\
The boat and men go on the sea.\
And so do mind and matter both\
Depend the one upon the other.



[37.] The correct vision of mentality and materiality, which,
after defining mentality-materiality by these various methods, has been
established on the plane of non-confusion by overcoming the perception
of a being, is what should be understood as purification of view. Other
terms for it are "defining of mentality- materiality" and "delimitation
of formations."



The eighteenth chapter called "The Description of Purification of View"
in the Treatise on the Development\
of Understanding in the *Path of Purification* composed for the purpose
of gladdening good people.



[]







## CHAPTER XIX 


PURIFICATION BY OVERCOMING DOUBT



(*Kaṅkhāvitaraṇa-visuddhi-niddesa*)



[1.]\[598\] Knowledge established by overcoming doubt about the
three divisions of time by means of discerning the conditions of that
same mentality-materiality is called "purification by overcoming doubt."



\[WAYS OF DISCERNING CAUSE AND CONDITION\]



[2.] The bhikkhu who wants to accomplish this sets about
seeking the cause and condition for that mentality-materiality; just as
when a skilled physician encounters a disease he seeks its origin, or
just as when a compassionate man sees a tender little child lying on its
back in the road he wonders who its parents are.



\[NEITHER CREATED BY A  CREATOR NOR CAUSELESS\]



[3.] To begin with, he considers thus: "Firstly this
mentality-materiality is not causeless, because if that were so, it
would follow that \[having no causes to differentiate it,\] it would be
identical everywhere always and for all. It has no Overlord, etc.,
because of the non-existence of any Overlord, etc. (XVI.85), over and
above mentality-materiality. And because, if people then argue that
mentality- materiality itself is its Overlord, etc., then it follows
that their mentality-materiality, which they call the Overlord, etc.,
would itself be causeless. Consequently there must be a cause and a
condition for it. What are they?"



[4.] Having thus directed his attention to
mentality-materiality's cause and condition, he first discerns the cause
and condition for the material body in this way: "When this body is born
it is not born inside a blue, red or white lotus or water-lily, etc., or
inside a store of jewels or pearls, etc.; on the contrary, like a worm
in rotting flesh, in a rotting corpse, in rotting dough, in a drain, in
a cesspool, etc., it is born in between the receptacle for undigested
food and the receptacle for digested food, behind the belly lining, in
front of the backbone, surrounded by the bowel and the entrails, in a
place that is stinking, disgusting, repulsive, and extremely cramped,
being itself stinking, disgusting, and repulsive. When it is born thus,
its causes (root-causes) are the four things, namely, ignorance,
craving, clinging, and kamma, \[599\]** ** since it is they that bring
about its birth; and nutriment is its condition, since it is that that
consolidates it. So five things constitute its cause and condition. And
of these, the three beginning with ignorance are the decisive-support
for this body, as the


[]



[]



mother is for her infant, and kamma begets it, as the father does the
child; and nutriment sustains it, as the wet-nurse does the infant."



\[ITS OCCURANCE IS ALWAYS DUE TO CONDITIONS\]



[5.]After discerning the material body's conditions in this
way, he again discerns the mental body in the way beginning: "Due to eye
and to visible object eye- consciousness arises" (S II 72; M I 111).
When he has thus seen that the occurrence of mentality-materiality is
due to conditions, then he sees that, as now, so in the past too its
occurrence was due to conditions, and in the future too its occurrence
will be due to conditions.



[6.]When he sees it in this way, all his uncertainty is
abandoned, that is to say, the five kinds of uncertainty about the past
stated thus: "Was I in the past? Was I not in the past? What was I in
the past? How was I in the past? Having been what, what was I in the
past?" (M I 8), and also the five kinds of uncertainty about the future
stated thus: "Shall I be in the future? Shall I not be in the future?
What shall I be in the future? How shall I be in the future? Having been
what, what shall I be in the future?" (M I 8); and also the six kinds of
uncertainty about the present stated thus: "Am I? Am I not? What am I?
How am I? Whence will this being have come? Whither will it be bound?"
(M I 8).



\[GENERAL AND PARTICULAR CONDITIONS\]



[7.]Another sees the conditions for mentality as two-fold,
according to what is common to all and to what is not common to all, and
that for materiality as fourfold, according to kamma, and so on.



[8.]The condition for mentality is twofold, as that which is
common to all and that which is not common to all. Herein, the six doors
beginning with the eye and the six objects beginning with visible data
are a condition-common-to-all for mentality because the occurrence of
all kinds \[of mentality\] classified as profitable, etc., is due to
that \[condition\]. But attention, etc., are not common to all; for wise
attention, hearing the Good Dhamma, etc., are a condition only for the
profitable, \[600\] while the opposite kinds are a condition for the
unprofitable. Kamma, etc., are a condition for the resultant mentality;
and the life-continuum, etc., are a condition for the functional.



[9.]Kamma, consciousness, temperature, and nutriment constitute
this fourfold condition for materiality beginning with kamma. Herein it
is only when it is past that kamma is a condition for kamma-originated
materiality; consciousness is a condition, when it is arising, for
consciousness-originated materiality. Temperature and nutriment are
conditions at the instant (moment) of their presence for
temperature-originated and nutriment-originated materiality.1



1\. "If the fruit were to arise from present kamma, the fruit would have
arisen in the same moment in which the kamma was being accumulated; and
that is not seen, nor is it desirable. For in the world (i.e. among
non-Buddhists) kamma has never been shown to give fruit while it is
actually being effected; nor is there any text to that effect---But is
it not also the fact that no fruit has ever been shown to come from a



[]



[]



This is how one man discerns the conditions for mentality-materiality.



[10.] When he has seen that the occurrence of
mentality-materiality is due to conditions in this way, he sees also
that, as now, so too in the past its occurrence was due to conditions,
and in the future its occurrence will be due to conditions. When he sees
it in this way, his uncertainty about the three periods of time is
abandoned in the way already stated.



\[DEPENDENT ORIGINATION IN REVERSE ORDER\]



[11.]Another, when he has seen that the formations called
mentality-materiality arrive at aging and that those that have aged
dissolve, discerns mentality-materiality's conditions by means of
dependent origination in reverse order in this way: "This is called
aging-and-death of formations; it comes to be when there is birth, and
birth when there is becoming, and becoming when there is clinging, and
clinging when there is craving, and craving when there is feeling, and
feeling when there is contact, and contact when there is the sixfold
base, and the sixfold base when there is mentality-materiality, and
mentality-materiality when there is consciousness, and consciousness
when there are formations, and formations when there is ignorance." Then
his uncertainty is abandoned in the way already stated.



\[DEPENDENT ORIGINATION IN DIRECT ORDER\]



[12.]Another discerns mentality-materiality's conditions by
means of dependent origination in direct order as already shown
(XVII.29) in detail, doing so in this way: "So, with ignorance as
condition there are formations" (M I 261). Then his uncertainty is
abandoned in the way already stated.



\[KAMMA  AND  KAMMA-RESULT\]



[13.]Another discerns mentality-materiality's conditions by
means of the round of kamma and the round of kamma-result in this way:



"In the previous kamma-process becoming there is delusion, which is
ignorance; there is accumulation, which is formations; there is
attachment, which is craving; there is embracing, which is clinging;
there is volition, which is becoming; thus



vanished cause either? Or even a cock to crow because of
that?---Certainly it has not been shown where the connectedness of
material things is broken off. But the simile does not apply because
there is connectedness of immaterial things here. For when the fruit
arises from kamma that is actually past it does so because of kamma
having been performed and because of storage. For this is said: 'Because
profitable sense- sphere kamma has been performed, stored up, there
comes to be eye-consciousness' (Dhs §431).\
"Since consciousness has efficient power only at the instant of its
arising, with the acquisition of a proximity condition, etc., it
therefore only gives rise to materiality while it is arising. But since
materiality has efficient power at the instant of its presence, with the
acquisition of a postnascence condition, etc., it is therefore said that
'temperature and nutriment are conditions at the instant of their
presence for temperature-originated and nutriment-originated
materiality.' Temperature and nutriment give rise to materiality at the
instant of their own presence by acquiring outside temperature and
nutriment as their condition, is the meaning" (Vism-mhṭ 768).



[]



[]



these five things in the previous kamma-process becoming are conditions
for rebirth-linking here \[in the present becoming\].



"Here \[in the present becoming\] there is rebirth-linking, which is
consciousness; there is descent \[into the womb\], which is
mentality-materiality; there is sensitivity, which is sense base; there
is what is touched, which is contact; there is what is felt, which is
feeling; thus these five things here in the \[present\] rebirth-process
becoming have their conditions in kamma done in the past.



"Here \[in the present becoming\] with the maturing of the bases there
is delusion, which is ignorance; there is accumulation, which is
formations; there is attachment, which is craving; there is embracing,
which is clinging; there is volition, which is becoming; thus these five
things here in the \[present\] kamma- process becoming are conditions
for rebirth-linking in the future.



"In the future there is rebirth-linking, which is consciousness; there
is descent \[into the womb\], which is mentality-materiality; there is
sensitivity, which is sense base; there is what is touched, which is
contact; there is what is felt, which is feeling; thus these five things
in the future rebirth-process becoming have their conditions in kamma
done here \[in the present becoming\]" (Paṭis I 52). \[601\]



[14.]Herein, kamma is fourfold: to be experienced here and now,
to be experienced on rebirth, to be experienced in some subsequent
becoming, and lapsed kamma.2



Of these, (i) the volition, either profitable or unprofitable, of the
first of the seven impulsion consciousnesses in a single cognitive
series of impulsions is called kamma to be experienced here and now: it
gives its result in this same



2\. "To be experienced here and now" means kamma whose fruit is to be
experienced in this present selfhood. "To be experienced on rebirth"
means kamma whose fruit is to be experienced \[in the becoming\] next to
the present becoming. "To be experienced in some subsequent existence"
means kamma whose fruit is to be experienced in some successive selfhood
other than either that here and now or next to that here and now.
"Lapsed kamma" is kamma of which it has to be said, "There has been
kamma, but there has not been, is not, and will not be kamma-result."
"The volition of the first impulsion, which has efficient power by not
being prevented by opposition and by having acquired the distinction of
a condition, and which has definitely occurred as a prior
kamma-formation of the appropriate kind, giving its fruit in this same
selfhood, is called '*to be experienced here and now.*' For while that
first- impulsion volition, being effective in the way stated, is helpful
to what is associated with its special qualities in the impulsion
continuity, yet because it wields little power over aspects and because
it has little result owing to lack of repetition, it is not, like the
other two kinds, kamma that looks beyond the occurring continuity and
looks to obtain an opportunity; it gives its fruit here only as mere
result during the course of becoming, like a mere flower. '*But if it
cannot do so*': kamma's giving of result comes about only through the
due concurrence of conditions consisting of (suitable) essentials of
becoming, means, etc., failing which it is unable to give its result in
that selfhood. '*That accomplishes its purpose*': that fulfils its
purpose consisting in giving, etc., and in killing, etc. For the seventh
impulsion to which this refers is the final impulsion in the series, and
when it has acquired distinction in the way already stated and has
acquired the service of repetition by the previous impulsions, it gives
its result in the next selfhood and is called 'to be experienced on
rebirth'" (Vism-mhṭ 769).



[]



[]



selfhood. But if it cannot do so, it is called (iv) lapsed kamma
(*ahosi-kamma*), according to the triad described thus, "There has been
(*ahosi*) kamma, there has been no kamma-result, there will be no
kamma-result" (see Paṭis II 78). (ii) The volition of the seventh
impulsion that accomplishes its purpose is called kamma to be
experienced on rebirth: it gives its result in the next selfhood. If it
cannot do so, it is called (iv) *lapsed kamma* in the way already
described. (iii) The volition of the five impulsions between these two
is called *kamma to be experienced in some subsequent becoming*: it
gives its result in the future when it gets the opportunity, and however
long the round of rebirths continues it never becomes lapsed kamma.



[15.]Another fourfold classification of kamma is this: weighty,
habitual, death- threshold, and kamma \[stored up\] by being performed.3



Herein, (v) when there is weighty and unweighty kamma, the *weightier*,
whether profitable or unprofitable, whether kamma consisting in
matricide or kamma of the exalted spheres, takes precedence in ripening.
(vi) Likewise, when there is habitual and unhabitual kamma, the *more
habitual*, whether consisting in good or bad conduct, takes precedence
in ripening. (vii) *Death-threshold* kamma is that remembered at the
time of death; for when a man near death can remember \[kamma\], he is
born according to that. (viii) Kamma not included in the foregoing three
kinds that has been often repeated is called *kamma* \[*stored up*\] *by
being performed*. This brings about rebirth-linking if other kinds fail.



[16.]Another fourfold classification of kamma is this:
productive, consolidating, frustrating, and supplanting.4



3\. "'Weighty' kamma is very reprehensible unprofitable kamma and very
powerful profitable kamma. 'Habitual' kamma is what is habitually,
continually done and repeated. 'Death-threshold' kamma is what is
remembered with great vividness at the time next before death; what is
meant is that there is no question about what is done at the time of
death. 'That has been often repeated': he draws a distinction between
this kind of kamma as stated and the 'habitual' kind and he likewise
excludes kamma to be experienced here and now from it because the
bringing on of rebirth-linking is admitted; for the tetrad beginning
with the 'weighty' is stated as productive of rebirth-linking. "Herein,
the weighty ripens first of all and that is why it is so called. When
weighty kamma is lacking, what has been much done ripens. When that is
lacking, death-threshold kamma ripens. When that too is lacking, then
kamma done in previous births, which is called 'kamma \[stored up\] by
being performed,' ripens. And the last three when produced can be strong
or weak" (Vism-mhṭ 769ff.). Vism-mhṭ then cites various Birth Stories
and MN 136 in order to show how, for various reasons, the result of one
kind of kamma may be delayed or displaced by the result of another.
Vism- mhṭ concludes: "This is the province of the Tathāgata's Knowledge
of the Great Exposition of Kamma, in other words, the mastery of the
order of ripening of such and such kamma for such and such reasons."\



4\. "'Productive' kamma is what produces resultant continuity by
providing rebirth- linking and so on. 'Consolidating' kamma prolongs the
occurrence of the continuity of pleasure or pain, or the endurance of
materiality. 'Frustrating' kamma slowly diminishes the endurance of
pleasure or pain when they occur. It cuts off the result of other kamma
without giving any result of its own. 'Supplanting' kamma, however, cuts
off weak kamma and makes its own result arise. This is their difference"
(Vism-mhṭ 771).



[]



[]



Herein, (ix) what is called *productive* is both profitable and
unprofitable. It produces the material and immaterial aggregates both at
rebirth-linking and during the course of an existence. (x)
*Consolidating* kamma cannot produce result, but when result has already
been produced in the provision of rebirth- linking by other kamma, it
consolidates the pleasure or pain that arises and makes it last. (xi)
And when result has already been produced in the provision of
rebirth-linking by other kamma, *frustrating* kamma frustrates and
obstructs the pleasure or pain that arises and does not allow it to
last. (xii) Supplanting kamma is itself both profitable and
unprofitable; \[602\] and it supplants other, weaker kamma, prevents its
resulting and usurps that kamma's opportunity in order to cause its own
result. But when the opportunity has thus been furnished by the
\[other\] kamma, it is that \[supplanting kamma's\] result that is
called arisen.5



[17.]The succession of kamma and its result in the twelve
classes of kamma is clear in its true nature only to the Buddhas'
"knowledge of kamma and its result," which knowledge is not shared by
disciples.6 But the succession of kamma and its result can be known in
part by one practicing insight. That is why this explanation of
difference in kamma shows only the mere headings.



This is how one man discerns mentality-materiality by means of the round
of kamma and the round of kamma-result, applying this twelve-fold kamma
classification to the round of kamma.



[18.]When he has thus seen by means of the round of kamma and
the round of kamma-result how mentality-materiality's occurrence is due
to a condition, he sees that as now, so in the past, its occurrence was
due to a condition by means of the round of kamma and the round of
kamma-result, and that in the future its occurrence will be due to a
condition by means of the round of kamma and the round of kamma-result.
This is kamma and kamma-result, the round of kamma and the round of
kamma-result, the occurrence of kamma and the occurrence of



5\. See the various meanings of "arisen" given in XXII.81f.\
"Another method is this: when some kamma has been done and there is,
either in rebirth-linking or in the course of an existence, the arising
of material instances due to the result of kamma performed, that kamma
is '*productive*.' When some kamma has been performed and the desirable
or undesirable fruit generated by other kamma has its production
facilitated and its endurance aided and lengthened by the suppression of
conditions that would interfere with it and by the arousing of
conditions that would strengthen it, that kamma is '*supporting*.' When
some kamma has been performed and profitable fruit or unprofitable fruit
generated by productive kamma is obstructed by it respectively in the
form of sickness or of disquieting of elements, that is '*frustrating*'
kamma. But when some kamma has been done by which the fruit of other
kamma is ruined and cut off by being supplanted by what cuts it off
although it was fit for longer endurance because of the efficacy of the
kamma that was producing it, that kamma is '*supplanting*'" (Vism-mhṭ
772).\



6\. "Because it is a speciality of the Buddha and because it is the
province of the knowledge that is not shared by disciples (see Paṭis I
121f.), it is called 'not shared by disciples.' That is why only a part
can be known; it cannot all be known because it is not the province of
such knowledge" (Vism-mhṭ 772).

kamma-result, the continuity of kamma and the continuity of
kamma-result, action and the fruit of action:



Kamma-result proceeds from kamma,\
Result has kamma for its source,\
Future becoming springs from kamma,\
And this is how the world goes round.



[19.]When he sees thus, he abandons all his uncertainty, that
is to say, the sixteen kinds described in the way beginning, "Was I in
the past?" \[see §6\].



\[NO DOER APART FROM KAMMA AND RESULT\]



In all kinds of becoming, generation, destiny, station, and abode there
appears only mentality-materiality, which occurs by means of linking of
cause with fruit. He sees no doer over and above the doing, no
experiencer of the result over and above the occurrence of the result.
But he sees clearly with right understanding that the wise say "doer"
when there is doing and "experiencer" when there is experiencing simply
as a mode of common usage.



[20.] Hence the Ancients said:



There is no doer of a deed\
Or one who reaps the deed's result;\
Phenomena alone flow on---\
No other view than this is right.



And so, while kamma and result\
Thus causally maintain their round,\
As seed and tree succeed in turn,\
No first beginning can be shown.



Nor in the future round of births\
Can they be shown not to occur:\
Sectarians, not knowing this,\
Have failed to gain self-mastery. \[603\]



They assume a being, see it as\
Eternal or annihilated.\
Adopt the sixty-two wrong views,\
Each contradicting one another.



The stream of craving bears them on\
Caught in the meshes of their views:\
And as the stream thus bears them on\
They are not freed from suffering.



A monk, disciple of the Buddha,\
With direct knowledge of this fact\
Can penetrate this deep and subtle\
Void conditionality.



[]



[]



There is no kamma in result,\
Nor does result exist in kamma;\
Though they are void of one another,\
There is no fruit without the kamma.



As fire does not exist inside\
The sun, a gem, cow-dung, nor yet\
Outside them, but is brought to be\
By means of its component parts,



So neither can result be found\
Within the kamma, nor without;\
Nor does the kamma still persist\
\[In the result it has produced\].



The kamma of its fruit is void;\
No fruit exists yet in the kamma;\
And still the fruit is born from it,\
Wholly depending on the kamma.



For here there is no Brahmā God,\
Creator of the round of births,\
Phenomena alone flow on---\
Cause and component their condition.



\[FULL-UNDERSTANDING OF THE KNOWN\]



[21.]When he has discerned the conditions of
mentality-materiality in this way by means of the round of kamma and the
round of kamma-result, and has abandoned uncertainty about the three
periods of time, then all past, future and present states are understood
by him in accordance with death and rebirth- linking. This is his
full-understanding of the known (see XX.3).



[22.] He understands thus: "Aggregates produced in the past
with kamma as condition ceased there too. But other aggregates are
produced in this becoming with past kamma as their condition, although
there is no single thing that has come over from the past becoming to
this becoming. And aggregates produced in this becoming with kamma as
their condition will cease. And in the future becoming other aggregates
will be produced, although no single thing will go over from this
becoming to the future becoming.



"Furthermore, just as, while the recitation from the teacher's mouth
does not enter into the pupil's mouth, yet recitation does not because
of that fail to take place in the pupil's mouth---and while the potion
drunk by the proxy does not enter the sick man's stomach, yet the
sickness does not because of that fail to be cured---and while the
arrangement of the ornaments on the face does not pass over to the
reflection of the face in the looking glass, yet the arrangement of the
ornaments does not because of that fail to appear---and while the flame
of a lamp does not move over from one wick to another, yet the flame
does not because of that fail to be produced---so too, while nothing
whatever moves over from the past becoming to this becoming, or from
this to the future becoming, \[604\] yet



[]



[]



aggregates, bases, and elements do not fail to be produced here with
aggregates, §bases, and elements in the past becoming as their
condition, or in the future becoming with aggregates, bases, and
elements here as their condition."



[23.] Just as eye-consciousness comes next Following on mind
element,\
Which, though it does not come from that,\
Yet fails not next to be produced,



So too, in rebirth-linking, conscious\
Continuity takes place:\
The prior consciousness breaks up,\
The subsequent is born from that.



They have no interval between,\
Nor gap \[that separates the two\];\
While naught whatever passes over,\
Still rebirth-linking comes about.



[24.]When all states are understood by him thus in accordance
with death and rebirth-linking, his knowledge of discerning the
conditions of mentality- materiality is sound in all its aspects and the
sixteen kinds of doubt are more effectively abandoned. And not only
that, but the eight kinds of doubt that occur in the way beginning thus,
"He is doubtful about the Master" (A III 248; Dhs §1004) are abandoned
too, and the sixty-two kinds of views are suppressed (See DN 1 and MN
102).



[25.]The knowledge that has been established by the overcoming
of doubt about the three periods of time by discerning the conditions of
mentality-materiality according to the various methods should be
understood as "purification by overcoming doubt." Other terms for it are
"knowledge of the relations of states" and "correct knowledge" and
"right vision."



[26.] For this is said: "Understanding of discernment of
conditions thus, 'Ignorance is a condition, formations are conditionally
arisen, and both these states are conditionally arisen,' is knowledge of
the causal relationship of states" (Paṭis I 50). And:



"When he brings to mind as impermanent, what states does he correctly
know and see? How is there right seeing? How, by inference from that,
are all formations clearly seen as impermanent? Wherein is doubt
abandoned? When he brings to mind as painful ... When he brings to mind
as not-self, what states does he correctly know and see? ... Wherein is
doubt abandoned?



"When he brings to mind as impermanent, he correctly knows and sees the
sign. Hence 'right seeing' is said. Thus, by inference from that, all
formations are clearly seen as impermanent. Herein doubt is abandoned.
When he brings to mind as painful, he correctly knows and sees
occurrence. Hence ... When he brings to mind as not-self, he correctly
knows and sees the sign and occurrence. Hence 'right seeing' is said.
Thus, by inference from that, all states are clearly seen as not-self.
Herein doubt is abandoned.



[]



[]



"Correct knowledge and right seeing and overcoming of doubt
\[605\]---are these things different in meaning and different in the
letter or are they one in meaning and only the letter is different?
Correct knowledge and right seeing and overcoming of doubt---these
things are one in meaning and only the letter is different" (Paṭis II
62f.).



[27.]When a man practicing insight has become possessed of this
knowledge, he has found comfort in the Buddhas' Dispensation, he has
found a foothold, he is certain of his destiny, he is called a "lesser
stream-enterer."



So would a bhikkhu overcome\
His doubts, then ever mindfully\
Let him discern conditions both\
Of mind and matter thoroughly.

## CHAPTER XX 


PURIFICATION BY KNOWLEDGE



AND



VISION OF WHAT IS THE PATH



AND



WHAT IS NOT THE PATH



(*Maggāmagga-ñāṇadassana-visuddhi-niddesa*)



[1.]\[606\] The knowledge established by getting to know the
path and the not- path thus, "This is the path, this is not the path,"
is called "purification by knowledge and vision of what is the path and
what is not the path."



[2.]One who desires to accomplish this should first of all
apply himself to the inductive insight called "comprehension by
groups.1" Why? Because knowledge of what is the path and what is not the
path appears in connection with the appearance of illumination, etc.
(XX.105f.) in one who has begun insight. For it is after illumination,
etc., have appeared in one who has already begun insight that there
comes to be knowledge of what is the path and what is not the path. And
comprehension by groups is the beginning of insight. That is why it is
set forth next to the overcoming of doubt. Besides, knowledge of what is
the path and what is not the path arises when "full-understanding as
investigation" is occurring, and full-understanding as investigation
comes next to full- understanding as the known (see XIX.21). So this is
also a reason why one who desires to accomplish this purification by
knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path should
first of all apply himself to comprehension by groups.



\[THE THREE KINDS OF FULL-UNDERSTANDING\]



[3.]Here is the exposition: there are three kinds of mundane
full-understanding, that is, full-understanding as the known,
full-understanding as investigation, and full-understanding as
abandoning, with reference to which it was said: "Understanding that is
direct-knowledge is knowledge in the sense of being known. Understanding
that is full-understanding is knowledge in the sense of



1\. "Comprehension by placing together in groups (totals) the states
that are differentiated into past, future and present is '*comprehension
by groups*.' This, it seems, is the term used by the inhabitants of
Jambudīpa (India). However, insight into states by means of the method
beginning, 'Any materiality whatever' (M III 16) is '*inductive
insight*.' This, it seems, is the term used by the inhabitants of
Tambapaṇṇidīpa (Sri Lanka). That is why he said "*to inductive insight
called comprehension by groups*'" (Vism-mhṭ 778).


[]



[]



investigating. Understanding that is abandoning is knowledge in the
sense of giving up" (Paṭis I 87).



Herein, the understanding that occurs by observing the specific
characteristics of such and such states thus, "Materiality (*rūpa*)* *
has the characteristic of being molested (*ruppana*); feeling has the
characteristic of being felt," is called *full*- *understanding as the
known.* The understanding consisting in insight with the general
characteristics as its object that occurs in attributing a general
characteristic to those same states in the way beginning, "Materiality
is impermanent, \[607\] feeling is impermanent" is called
*full*-*understanding as investigation.*2 The understanding consisting
in insight with the characteristics as its object that occurs as the
abandoning of the perception of permanence, etc., in those same states
is called *full*-*understanding as abandoning*.



[4.]Herein, the plane of *full*-*understanding as the known*
extends from the delimitation of formations (Ch. XVIII) up to the
discernment of conditions (Ch. XIX); for in this interval the
penetration of the specific characteristics of states predominates. The
plane of *full*-*understanding as investigation* extends from
comprehension by groups up to contemplation of rise and fall (XXI.3f.);
for in this interval the penetration of the general characteristics
predominates. The plane of *full*-*understanding as abandoning* extends
from contemplation of dissolution onwards (XXI.10); for from there
onwards the seven contemplations that effect the abandoning of the
perception of permanence, etc., predominate thus:



\(1\)



Contemplating \[formations\] as impermanent, a man abandons



the perception of permanence.



\(2\)



Contemplating \[them\] as painful, he abandons the perception



of pleasure.



\(3\)



Contemplating \[them\] as not-self, he abandons the perception



of self.



\(4\)



Becoming dispassionate, he abandons delighting.



\(5\)



Causing fading away, he abandons greed.



\(6\)



Causing cessation, he abandons originating.



\(7\)



Relinquishing, he abandons grasping (Paṭis I 58).3



2\. *Tīraṇa* could also be rendered by "judging." On specific and
general characteristics Vism-mhṭ says: "Hardness, touching, etc., as the
respective characteristics of earth, contact, etc., which are observable
at all three instants \[of arising, presence and dissolution\], are
apprehended by their being established as the respective individual
essences of definite materialness. But it is not so with the
characteristics of impermanence, and so on. These are apprehended as
though they were attributive material instances because they have to be
apprehended under the respective headings of dissolution and rise and
fall, of oppression, and of insusceptibility to the exercise of mastery"
(Vism-mhṭ 779). See Ch. XXI, note 3.\
The "planes" given here in §4 are not quite the same as described in
XXII.107.



3\. "'*Contemplating as impermanent*' is contemplating, comprehending,
formations in the aspect of impermanence. '*The perception of
permanence*' is the wrong perception that they are permanent, eternal;
the kinds of consciousness associated with wrong



[]



[]



[5.] So, of these three kinds of full-understanding, only
full-understanding as the known has been attained by this meditator as
yet, which is because the delimitation of formations and the discernment
of conditions have already been accomplished; the other two still remain
to be attained. Hence it was said above: "Besides, knowledge of what is
the path and what is not the path arises when full-understanding as
investigation is occurring, and full-understanding as investigation
comes next to full-understanding as the known. So this is also a reason
why one who desires to accomplish this purification by knowledge and
vision of what is the path and what is not the path should first of all
apply himself to comprehension by groups" (§2).



\[INSIGHT: COMPREHENSION BY GROUPS\]



[6.]Here is the text:



"How is it that understanding of defining past, future and present
states by



summarization is knowledge of comprehension?



"Any materiality whatever, whether past, future or present, internal or
external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near---he
defines all materiality as impermanent: this is one kind of
comprehension. He defines it as painful: this is one kind of
comprehension. He defines it as not-self: this is one kind of
comprehension. Any feeling whatever ... Any perception whatever ... Any
formations whatever ... Any consciousness whatever ... He defines all
consciousness as impermanent: ... He defines it as not-self: this is one
kind of comprehension. The eye ... (etc.) ... ageing-and-death, whether
past, future or present, he defines it** ** as impermanent: this is one
kind of comprehension. He defines it as painful: this is one kind of
comprehension. He defines it as not-self: this is one kind of
comprehension.



"Understanding of defining by summarization thus, 'Materiality, whether
past, future, or present, is impermanent in the sense of destruction,
painful in the sense of terror, not-self in the sense of having no
core,' is knowledge of comprehension. Understanding of defining by
generalization thus, 'Feeling ...



view should be regarded as included under the heading of 'perception.'
So too with what follows. '*Becoming dispassionate*' is seeing
formations with dispassion by means of the contemplation of dispassion
induced by the contemplations of impermanence, and so on. '*Delighting*'
is craving accompanied by happiness. 'Causing fading away' is
contemplating in such a way that greed (*rāga*) for formations does not
arise owing to the causing of greed to fade (*virajjana*) by the
contemplation of fading away (*virāgānupassanā*); for one who acts thus
is said to abandon greed. '*Causing cessation*' is contemplating in such
a way that, by the contemplation of cessation, formations cease only,
they do not arise in the future through a new becoming; since one who
acts thus is said to abandon the arousing (originating) of formations
because of producing the nature of non-arising. '*Relinquishing*' is
relinquishing in such a way that, by the contemplation of
relinquishment, formations are not grasped anymore; hence he said, '*He
abandons grasping*'; or the meaning is that he relinquishes apprehending
\[them\] as permanent, and so on" (Vism-mhṭ 780).



[]



[]



\[608\] (etc.) ... Consciousness ... Eye ... (etc.) ...
Ageing-and-death, whether past ...' is knowledge of comprehension.



"Understanding of defining by summarization thus, 'Materiality, whether
past, future, or present, is impermanent, formed, dependently arisen,
subject to destruction, subject to fall, subject to fading away, subject
to cessation,' is knowledge of comprehension. Understanding of defining
by generalization thus, 'Feeling ... (etc.) ... Consciousness ... Eye
... (etc.) ... Ageing-and-death, whether past, future, or present, is
impermanent, formed, dependently arisen, subject to destruction, subject
to fall, subject to fading away, subject to cessation' is knowledge of
comprehension.



"Understanding of defining by summarization thus, 'With birth as
condition there is ageing-and-death; without birth as condition there is
no ageing-and- death,' is knowledge of comprehension. Understanding of
defining by generalization thus, 'In the past and in the future with
birth as condition there is ageing-and-death; without birth as condition
there is no ageing-and-death,' is knowledge of comprehension.
Understanding of defining by generalization thus, 'With becoming as
condition there is birth ... With ignorance as condition there are
formations; without ignorance as condition there are no formations,' is
knowledge of comprehension. Understanding of defining by generalization
thus, 'In the past and in the future with ignorance as condition there
are formations; without ignorance as condition there are no formations'
is knowledge of comprehension.



"Knowledge is in the sense of that being known and understanding is in
the sense of the act of understanding that. Hence it was said:
'Understanding of defining past, future, and present states by
summarization is knowledge of comprehension'" (Paṭis I 53f.).



[9.]Herein, the abbreviation, "The eye ... (etc.) ...
Ageing-and-death," should be understood to represent the following sets
of things elided:



[1.] The states that occur in the doors \[of consciousness\]
together with the doors and the objects.



[2.] The five aggregates.



[3.] The six doors.



[4.] The six objects.



[5.] The six kinds of consciousness.



[6.] The six kinds of contact.



[7.] The six kinds of feeling.



[8.] The six kinds of perception.



[9.] The six kinds of volition.



[10.] The six kinds of craving.



[11.] The six kinds of applied thought.



[12.] The six kinds of sustained thought.



[13.] The six elements.



[14.] The ten kasiṇas.



[15.] The thirty-two bodily aspects.



[16.] The twelve bases.

[]



[17.] The eighteen elements.



[18.] The twenty-two faculties.



[19.] The three elements.



[20.] The nine kinds of becoming.



[21.] The four jhānas.



[22.] The four measureless states.



[23.] The four \[immaterial\] attainments.



[24.] The twelve members of the dependent origination.



[10.] For this is said in the Paṭisambhidā in the description
of what is to be directly known: "Bhikkhus, all is to be directly known.
And what is all that is to be directly known? \[609\] (1) Eye is to be
directly known; visible objects are to be directly known;
eye-consciousness ... eye-contact ... feeling, pleasant or painful or
neither-painful-nor-pleasant, that arises due to eye-contact is also to
be directly known. Ear ... Mind ... feeling, pleasant or painful or
neither-painful-nor- pleasant, that arises due to mind-contact is also
to be directly known.

of the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception ... (24)
Ignorance is to be directly known ... ageing- and-death is to be
directly known" (Paṭis I 5f.).



[12.]Since all this detail is given there it has been
abbreviated here. But what is thus abbreviated includes the supramundane
states. These should not be dealt with at this stage because they are
not amenable to comprehension. And as regards those that are amenable to
comprehension a beginning should be made by comprehending those among
them that are obvious to and easily discernible by the individual
\[meditator\].



\[COMPREHENSION BY GROUPS---APPLICATION OF TEXT\]



[13.]Here is the application of the directions dealing with the
aggregates: "Any materiality whatever, (i--iii) whether past, future, or
present, (iv--v) internal or



[]



[]



external, (vi--vii) gross or subtle, (viii--ix) inferior or superior,
(x-xi) far or near--- he defines all materiality as impermanent: this is
one kind of comprehension. He defines it as painful: \[610\] this is one
kind of comprehension. He defines it as not-self: this is one kind of
comprehension" (see §6). At this point this bhikkhu \[takes\] all
materiality, which is described without specifying as "*any materiality
whatever*," and having delimited it in the eleven instances, namely,
with the past triad and with the four dyads beginning with the internal
dyad, he "*defines all materiality as impermanent*," he comprehends that
it is impermanent. How? In the way stated next. For this is said:
"*Materiality, whether past, future or present, is impermanent in the
sense of destruction*."



[14.] Accordingly, he comprehends the materiality that is past
as "*impermanent* *in the sense of destruction*" because it was
destroyed in the past and did not reach this becoming; and he
comprehends the materiality that is future as "*impermanent in the sense
of destruction*" since it will be produced in the next becoming, will be
destroyed there too, and will not pass on to a further becoming; and he
comprehends the materiality that is present as "*impermanent in the
sense of destruction*"* * since it is destroyed here and does not pass
beyond. And he comprehends the materiality that is internal as
"*impermanent in the sense of destruction*" since it is destroyed as
internal and does not pass on to the external state. And he comprehends
the materiality that is external ... gross ... subtle ... inferior ...
superior ... far ... And he comprehends the materiality that is near as
"*impermanent in the sense of destruction*" since it is destroyed there
and does not pass on to the far state. And all this is impermanent in
the sense of destruction. Accordingly, there is "*one kind of
comprehension*" in this way; but it is effected in eleven ways.



[15.]And all that \[materiality\] is "*painful in the sense of
terror*." In the sense of terror because of its terrifyingness; for what
is impermanent brings terror, as it does to the deities in the Sīhopama
Sutta (S III 84). So this is also painful in the sense of terror.
Accordingly, there is one kind of comprehension in this way too; but it
is effected in eleven ways.



[16.]And just as it is painful, so too all that \[materiality\]
is "*not-self in the sense of having no core*." In the sense of having
no core because of the absence of any core of self conceived as a self,
an abider, a doer, an experiencer, one who is his own master; for what
is impermanent is painful (S III 82), and it is impossible to escape the
impermanence, or the rise and fall and oppression, of self, so how could
it have the state of a doer, and so on? Hence it is said, "Bhikkhus,
were materiality self, it would not lead to affliction" (S III 66), and
so on. So this is also not-self in the sense of having no core.
Accordingly, there is one kind of comprehension in this way too, but it
is effected in eleven ways. \[611\] The same method applies to feeling,
and so on.



[17.]But what is impermanent is necessarily classed as formed,
etc., and so in order to show the synonyms for that \[impermanence\], or
in order to show how the attention given to it occurs in different ways,
it is restated in the text thus: "Materiality, whether past, future, or
present, is impermanent, formed, dependently arisen, subject to
destruction, subject to fall, subject to fading away, subject to
cessation" (§7). The same method applies to feeling, and so on.



[]



[]



\[STRENGTHENING OF COMPREHENSION IN FORTY WAYS\]



[18.] Now, when the Blessed One was expounding conformity
knowledge, he \[asked the question\]: "By means of what forty aspects
does he acquire liking that is in conformity? By means of what forty
aspects does he enter into the certainty of rightness?" (P'8).4 In the
answer to it comprehension of impermanence, etc., is set forth by him
analytically in the way beginning: "\[Seeing\] the five aggregates as
impermanent, as painful, as a disease, a boil, a dart, a calamity, an
affliction, as alien, as disintegrating, as a plague, a disaster, a
terror, a menace, as fickle, perishable, unenduring, as no protection,
no shelter, no refuge, as empty, vain, void, not-self, as a danger, as
subject to change, as having no core, as the root of calamity, as
murderous, as due to be annihilated, as subject to cankers, as formed,
as Māra's bait, as subject to birth, subject to ageing, subject to
illness, subject to death, subject to sorrow, subject to lamentation,
subject to despair, subject to defilement. Seeing the five aggregates as
impermanent, he acquires liking that is in conformity. And seeing that
the cessation of the five aggregates is the permanent Nibbāna, he enters
into the certainty of rightness" (Paṭis II 238). So in order to
strengthen that same comprehension of impermanence, pain, and not-self
in the five aggregates, this \[meditator\] also comprehends these five
aggregates by means of that \[kind of comprehension\].



[19.]How does he do it? He does it by means of comprehension as
impermanent, etc., stated specifically as follows: He comprehends each
aggregate as *impermanent* because of non-endlessness, and because of
possession of a beginning and an end; as *painful* because of oppression
by rise and fall, and because of being the basis for pain; as *a
disease* because of having to be maintained by conditions, and because
of being the root of disease; as *a boil* because of being consequent
upon impalement by suffering, because of oozing with the filth of
defilements, and because of being swollen by arising, ripened by ageing,
and burst by dissolution; as  *a dart* because of producing oppression,
because of penetrating inside, and because of being hard to extract; as
*a calamity* because of having to be condemned, because of bringing
loss, and \[612\] because of being the basis for calamity; as *an
affliction* because of restricting freedom, and because of being the
foundation for affliction; as *alien* because of inability to have
mastery exercised over them, and because of intractability; as
*disintegrating* because of crumbling through sickness, ageing and
death; as *a plague* because of bringing various kinds of ruin; as *a
disaster * because of bringing unforeseen and plentiful adversity, and
because of being the basis for all kinds of terror, and because of being
the opposite of the supreme comfort called the stilling of all

that it is towards misery (*ādīna*) that it moves (*vāti*), goes,

wretched too; as *subject to change* because of having the nature of
change in two ways, that is, through ageing and through death; as
*having no core* because of feebleness, and because of decaying soon

of being the cause of sorrow, lamentation and despair; as *subject to
defilement* because of being the objective field of the defilements of

[20.]Now, there are \[613\] fifty kinds of contemplation of
impermanence here by taking the following ten in the case of each
aggregate: as impermanent, as disintegrating, as fickle, as perishable,
as unenduring, as subject to change, as having no core, as due to be
annihilated, as formed, as subject to death. There are twenty-five kinds
of contemplation of not-self by taking the following five in the case of
each aggregate: as alien, as empty, as vain, as void, as not-self. There
are

one hundred and twenty-five kinds of contemplation of pain by taking the
rest beginning with "as painful, as a disease" in the case of each
aggregate.



So when a man comprehends the five aggregates by means of this
comprehending as impermanent, etc., in its two hundred aspects, his
comprehending as impermanent, painful and not-self, which is called
"inductive insight," is strengthened. These in the first place are the
directions for undertaking comprehension here in accordance with the
method given in the texts.



\[NINE WAYS OF SHARPENING THE FACULTIES, ETC.



[21.] While thus engaged in inductive insight, however, if it
does not succeed, he should sharpen his faculties \[of faith, etc.,\] in
the nine ways stated thus: "The faculties become sharp in nine ways: (1)
he sees only the destruction of arisen formations; (2) and in that
\[occupation\] he makes sure of working carefully, (3) he makes sure of
working perseveringly, (4) he makes sure of working suitably, and (5) by
apprehending the sign of concentration and (6) by balancing the
enlightenment factors (7) he establishes disregard of body and life, (8)
wherein he overcomes \[pain\] by renunciation and (9) by not stopping
halfway.12 He should avoid the seven unsuitable things in the way stated
in the Description of the Earth Kasiṇa (IV.34) and cultivate the seven
suitable things, and he should comprehend the material at one time and
the immaterial at another.



\[COMPREHENSION OF THE MATERIAL\]



[22.] While comprehending materiality he should see how
materiality is generated,13 that is to say, how this materiality is
generated by the four causes beginning with kamma. Herein, when
materiality is being generated in any being, it is first generated from
kamma. For at the actual moment of rebirth- linking of a child in the
womb, first thirty instances of materiality are generated in the triple
continuity, in other words, the decads of physical \[heart-\]basis,
body, and sex. And those are generated at the actual instant of the
rebirth-linking consciousness's arising. And as at the instant of its
arising, so too at the instant of its presence and at the instant of its
dissolution.14



[23.] Herein, the cessation of materiality is slow and its
transformation ponderous, while the cessation of consciousness is swift
and its transformation quick (light); hence it is said, "Bhikkhus, I see
no other one thing that is so quickly transformed as \[614\] the mind"
(A I 10).



[24.]For the life-continuum consciousness arises and ceases
sixteen times while one material instant endures. With consciousness the
instant of arising, instant

[]



of presence, and instant of dissolution are equal; but with materiality
only the instants of arising and dissolution are quick like those \[of
consciousness\], while the instant of its presence is long and lasts
while sixteen consciousnesses arise and cease.



[25.] The second life-continuum arises with the prenascent
physical \[heart- \]basis as its support, which has already reached
presence and arose at the rebirth-linking consciousness's instant of
arising. The third life-continuum arises with the prenascent physical
basis as its support, which has already reached presence and arose
together with that \[second life-continuum consciousness\]. The
occurrence of consciousness can be understood to happen in this way
throughout life. But in one who is facing death sixteen consciousnesses
arise with a single prenascent physical \[heart-\]basis as their
support, which has already reached presence.



[26.] The materiality that arose at the instant of arising of
the rebirth-linking consciousness ceases along with the sixteenth
consciousness after the rebirth- linking consciousness. That arisen at
the instant of presence of the rebirth-linking consciousness ceases
together with the instant of arising of the seventeenth. That arisen at
the instant of its dissolution ceases on arriving at the instant of
presence of the seventeenth.15 It goes on occurring thus for as long as
the recurrence \[of births\] continues.



Also seventy instances of materiality occur in the same way with the
sevenfold



continuity \[beginning with the eye decad\] of those apparitionally
born.



\[(A) KAMMA-BORN  MATERIALITY\]



[27.] Herein, \[as regards kamma-born materiality\] the
analysis should be understood thus: (1) kamma, (2) what is originated by
kamma, (3) what has kamma as its condition, (4) what is originated by
consciousness that has kamma as its condition, (5) what is originated by
nutriment that has kamma as its condition, (6) what is originated by
temperature that has kamma as its condition (XI.111--14).



[28.]Herein, (1) *kamma* is profitable and unprofitable
volition. (2) *What is originated by kamma* is* * the kamma-resultant
aggregates and the seventy instances of materiality beginning with the
eye decad. (3) *What has kamma as its condition* is the same \[as the
last\] since kamma is the condition that upholds what is originated by
kamma.



[29.] (4)  *What is originated by consciousness that has kamma
as its condition* is materiality originated by kamma-resultant
consciousness. (5) *What is originated by nutriment that has kamma as
its condition* is so called since the nutritive essence that has reached
presence in the instances of materiality originated by kamma originates
a further octad-with-nutritive-essence-as-eighth, and the nutritive
essence there that has reached presence also originates a further one,
and so it



15\. The relationship of the duration of moments of matter and moments
of consciousness is dealt with in greater detail in the
*Sammohavinodanī* (Vibh-a 25f.). See also Introduction, note 18.



[]



[]



links up four or five occurrences of octads.    (6) *What is originated
by temperature that has kamma as its condition* is so called since the
kamma-born fire element that has reached presence originates an
octad-with-nutritive-essence-as-eighth, which is temperature-originated,
and the temperature in that originates a further octad-with-
nutritive-essence-as eighth, and so it links up four or five occurrences
of octads.



This is how the generation of kamma-born materiality in the first place
should



be seen. \[615\]



\[(B) CONSCIOUSNESS-BORN  MATERIALITY\]



[30.] Also as regards the consciousness-born kinds, the
analysis should be understood thus: (1) consciousness, (2) what is
originated by consciousness, (3) what has consciousness as its
condition, (4) what is originated by nutriment that has consciousness as
its condition, (5) what is originated by temperature that has
consciousness as its condition.



[31.]Herein, (1) *consciousness* is the eighty-nine kinds of
consciousness. Among these:



Consciousnesses thirty-two,\
And twenty-six, and nineteen too,\
Are reckoned to give birth to matter,\
Postures, also intimation;\
Sixteen kinds of consciousness\
Are reckoned to give birth to none.



As regards the sense sphere, thirty-two consciousnesses, namely, the
eight profitable consciousnesses ((1)--(8)), the twelve unprofitable
((22)--(33)), the ten functional excluding the mind element
((71)--(80)), and the two direct-knowledge consciousnesses as profitable
and functional, give rise to materiality, to postures, and to
intimation. The twenty-six consciousnesses, namely, the ten of the
fine-material sphere ((9)--(13), (81)--(85)) and the eight of the
immaterial sphere ((14)--(17), (86)-- (89)) excluding the resultant \[in
both cases\], and the eight supramundane ((18)-- (21), (66)--(69)), give
rise to materiality, to postures but not to intimation. The nineteen
consciousnesses, namely, the ten life-continuum consciousnesses in the
sense sphere ((41)--(49), (56)), the five in the fine-material sphere
((57)--(61)), the three mind elements ((39), (55), (70)), and the one
resultant mind-consciousness element without root- cause and accompanied
by joy (40), give rise to materiality only, not to postures or to
intimation. The sixteen consciousnesses, namely, the two sets of five
consciousnesses ((34)--(38), (50)--(54)), the rebirth-linking
consciousness of all beings, the death consciousness of those whose
cankers are destroyed, and the four immaterial resultant consciousnesses
((62)--(65)) do not give rise to materiality or to postures or to
intimation. And those herein that do give rise to materiality do not do
so at the instant of their presence or at the instant of their
dissolution, for consciousness is weak then. But it is strong at the
instant of arising. Consequently it originates materiality then with the
prenascent physical basis as its support.



[32.](2) *What is originated by consciousness* is the three
other immaterial aggregates and the seventeenfold materiality, namely,
the sound ennead, bodily intimation,



[]



[]



verbal intimation, the space element, lightness, malleability,
wieldiness, growth, and continuity.



\(3\) *What has consciousness as its condition* is the materiality of
fourfold origination stated thus: "Postnascent states of consciousness
and consciousness- concomitants are a condition, as postnascence
condition, for this prenascent body" (Paṭṭh I 5).



[33.](4) *What is originated by nutriment that has
consciousness as its condition:* the nutritive essence that has reached
presence in consciousness-originated material instances originates a
further octad-with-nutritive-essence-as-eighth, and thus links up two or
three occurrences of octads.



[34.](5) *What is originated by temperature that has
consciousness as its condition:* the consciousness-originated
temperature that has \[616\] reached presence originates a further
octad-with-nutritive-essence-as-eighth, and thus links up two or three
occurrences.



This is how the generation of consciousness-born materiality should be
seen.



\[(C) NUTRIMENT-BORN  MATERIALITY\]



[35.] Also as regards the nutriment-born kinds, the analysis
should be understood thus: (1) nutriment, (2) what is originated by
nutriment, (3) what has nutriment as its condition, (4) what is
originated by nutriment that has nutriment as its condition, (5) what is
originated by temperature that has nutriment as its condition.



[36.]Herein, (1) *nutriment* is physical nutriment. (2) *What
is originated by nutriment* is the fourteenfold materiality, namely,
(i--viii) that of the octad-with-nutritive- essence-as-eighth originated
by nutritive essence that has reached presence by obtaining as its
condition kamma-born materiality that is clung to (kammically acquired)
and basing itself on that,16 and (ix) space element, (x--xiv) lightness,
malleability, wieldiness, growth, and continuity.



\(3\) *What has nutriment as its condition* is the materiality of
fourfold origination stated thus: "Physical nutriment is a condition, as
nutriment condition, for this body" (Paṭṭh I 5).



[37.] (4) *What is originated by nutriment that has nutriment
as its condition:* the nutritive essence that has reached presence in
nutriment-originated material instances originates a further
octad-with-nutritive-essence-as-eighth and the nutritive essence in that
octad originates a further octad, and thus links up the occurrence of
octads ten or twelve times. Nutriment taken on one day sustains



16\. "'*By obtaining as its condition kamma-born materiality that is
clung-to*': by this he points out that external un-clung-to nutritive
essence does not perform the function of nourishing materiality. He said
'*and basing itself on that*' meaning that its obtaining of a condition
is owing to its being supported by what is kamma-born. And '*clung-to*'
is specifically mentioned in order to rule out any question of there
being a 'kamma- born' method for 'materiality originated by
consciousness that has kamma as its condition' just because it happens
to be rooted in kamma \[There is no such method\]" (Vism-mhṭ 793f.).



[]



[]



for as long as seven days; but divine nutritive essence sustains for as
long as one or two months. The nutriment taken by a mother originates
materiality by pervading the body of the child \[in gestation\]. Also
nutriment smeared on the body originates materiality. Kamma-born
nutriment is a name for nutriment that is clung to. That also originates
materiality when it has reached presence. And the nutritive essence in
it originates a further octad. Thus it links up four or five
occurrences.



[38.] (5) *What is originated by temperature that has nutriment
as its condition*: nutriment-originated fire element that has reached
presence originates an octad- with-nutritive-essence-as-eighth that is
thus temperature-originated. Here this nutriment is a condition for
nutriment-originated material instances as their progenitor. It is a
condition for the rest as support, nutriment, presence, and
non-disappearance.



This is how the generation of nutriment-born materiality should be seen.



\[(D) TEMPERATURE-BORN  MATERIALITY\]



[39.] Also as regards the temperature-born kinds, the analysis
should be understood thus: (1) temperature, (2) what is originated by
temperature, (3) what has temperature as its condition, (4) what is
originated by temperature that has temperature as its condition, (5)
what is originated by nutriment that has temperature as its condition.



[40.]Herein, (1) *temperature* is* * the fire element of
fourfold origination; but it is twofold as hot temperature and cold
temperature. (2) *What is originated by temperature:* the temperature of
fourfold origination that has reached presence by obtaining a clung-to
condition originates materiality in the body. \[617\] That materiality
is fifteenfold, namely, sound ennead, space element, lightness,
malleability, wieldiness, growth, continuity. (3) *What has temperature
as its condition* is so* * called since temperature is a condition for
the occurrence and for the destruction of materiality of fourfold
origination.



[41.](4) *What is originated by temperature that has
temperature as its condition*:* * the temperature-originated fire
element that has reached presence originates a further
octad-with-nutritive-essence-as-eighth, and the temperature in that
octad originates a further octad. Thus temperature-originated
materiality both goes on occurring for a long period and also maintains
itself as well in what is not clung to.17



[42.]



\(5\) *What is originated by nutriment that has temperature as its
condition*:* * the temperature-originated nutritive essence that has
reached presence originates a further
octad-with-nutritive-essence-as-eighth, and the nutritive essence in
that originates a further one, thus it links up ten or twelve
occurrences of octads.



Herein, this temperature is a condition for temperature-originated
material instances as their progenitor. It is a condition for the rest
as support, presence, and non-disappearance.



17\. "What is intended is head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin,
callosities, warts, etc., which are separate from the flesh in a living
body; otherwise a corpse, and so on" (Vism-mhṭ 795).



[]



[]



This is how the generation of temperature-born materiality should be
seen.



One who sees the generation of materiality thus is said to "comprehend
the



material at one time" (§21).18



\[COMPREHENSION OF THE IMMATERIAL\]



[43.]And just as one who is comprehending the material should
see the generation of the material, so too one who is comprehending the
immaterial should see the generation of the immaterial. And that is
through the eighty-one mundane arisings of consciousness, that is to
say, it is by kamma accumulated in a previous becoming that this
immaterial \[mentality\] is generated. And in the first place it is
generated as \[one of\] the nineteen kinds of arisings of consciousness
as rebirth-linking (XVII.130). But the modes in which it is generated
should be understood according to the method given in the Description of
the Dependent Origination (XVII.134f.). That same \[nineteenfold arising
of consciousness is generated\] as life-continuum as well, starting from
the consciousness next to rebirth-linking consciousness, and as death
consciousness at the termination of the life span. And when it is of the
sense sphere, and the object in the six doors is a vivid one, it is also
generated as registration.



[44.]In the course of an existence, eye-consciousness, together
with its associated states, supported by light and caused by attention
is generated because the eye is intact and because visible data have
come into focus. For it is actually when a visible datum has reached
presence that it impinges on the eye at the instant of the eye-
sensitivity's presence. When it has done so, the life-continuum arises
and ceases twice. Next to arise is the functional mind element with that
same object, accomplishing the function of adverting. Next to that,
eye-consciousness, which is the result of profitable or of unprofitable
\[kamma\] and sees that same visible datum. \[618\] Next, the resultant
mind element, which receives that same visible datum. Next, the
resultant root-causeless mind-consciousness element, which investigates
that same visible datum. Next, the functional mind-consciousness element
without root-cause and accompanied by equanimity, which determines that
same visible datum. Next, \[it is generated either\] as one from among
the profitable ((l)--(8)), unprofitable ((22)--(33)), or functional
((71) and (73)--(80)) kinds of consciousness belonging to the sense
sphere, either as consciousness accompanied by equanimity and without
root-cause (71),19 or as five or seven impulsions. Next, in the case of
sense-sphere beings, \[it is generated\] as any of the eleven kinds of
registration consciousness conforming \[as to object\] with the
impulsions. The same applies to the remaining doors. But in the case of
the mind door-exalted consciousnesses also arise.



This is how the generation of the immaterial should be seen in the case
of the



six doors.



18\. "When the generation of materiality is seen its dissolution also is
seen, and so he said, '*One who sees the generation of materiality thus
is said to comprehend the material at one time*' because of the brevity
of states' occurrence; for it is not the seeing of mere generation that
is called comprehension but there must be seeing of rise and fall
besides. So too the apprehending of generation in the other instances"
(Vism-mhṭ 795).



19\. "This refers to determining" (Vism-mhṭ 795).



[]



[]



One who sees the generation of the immaterial thus is said to
"comprehend



the immaterial at another time" (§21).



[45.]This is how one \[meditator\] accomplishes the development
of understand- ing, progressing gradually by comprehending at one time
the material and at another time the immaterial, by attributing the
three characteristics to them.



\[THE  MATERIAL  SEPTAD\]



Another comprehends formations by attributing the three characteristics
to



them through the medium of the material septad and the immaterial
septad.



[46.] Herein, one who comprehends \[them\] by attributing \[the
characteristics\] in the following seven ways is said to comprehend by
attributing through the medium of the material septad, that is to say,
(1) as taking up and putting down, (2) as disappearance of what grows
old in each stage, (3) as arising from nutriment, (4) as arising from
temperature, (5) as kamma-born, (6) as consciousness-originated, and (7)
as natural materiality. Hence the Ancients said:



"(1) As taking up and putting down,\
(2) As growth and decline in every stage,\
(3) As nutriment, (4) as temperature,\
(5) As kamma, and (6) as consciousness,\
(7) As natural materiality---\
He sees with seven detailed insights."



[47.] *1.* Herein, *taking up* is rebirth-linking. *Putting
down* is death. So the meditator allots one hundred years for this
"taking up" and "putting down" and he attributes the three
characteristics to formations. How? All formations between these limits
are impermanent. Why? Because of the occurrence of rise and fall,
because of change, because of temporariness, and because of preclusion
of permanence. But since arisen formations have arrived at presence, and
when present are afflicted by ageing, and on arriving at ageing are
bound to dissolve, they are therefore painful because of continual
oppression, because of being hard to bear, because of being the basis of
suffering, and because of precluding pleasure. And since no one has any
power over arisen formations in the three instances, "Let them not reach
presence", "Let those that have reached presence not age," and "Let
those that have reached ageing not dissolve," and they are void of the
possibility of any power being exercised over them, they are therefore
not-self because void, because ownerless, because unsusceptible to the
wielding of power, and because of precluding a self.20 \[619\]



20\. "No one, not even the Blessed One, has such mastery; for it is
impossible for anyone to alter the three characteristics. The province
of supernormal power is simply the alteration of a state" (Vism-mhṭ
797).\
"'*Because of precluding a self*' means because of precluding the self
conceived by those outside the Dispensation; for the non-existence in
dhammas of any self as conceived by outsiders is stated by the words,
'*because void*'; but by this expression \[it is stated\] that there is
no self because there is no such individual essence" (Vism-mhṭ 797).



[]



[]



[48.]*2. (a)* Having attributed the three characteristics to
materiality allotted one hundred years for the "taking up" and "putting
down" thus, he next attributes them according to *disappearance of what
grows old in each stage.* Herein, "disappearance of what grows old in
each stage" is a name for the disappearance of the materiality that has
grown old during a stage \[of life\]. The meaning is that he attributes
the three characteristics by means of that.



[49.]How? He divides that same hundred years up into three
stages, that is, the first stage, the middle stage, and the last stage.
Herein, the first thirty-three years are called the first stage, the
next thirty-four years are called the middle stage, and the next
thirty-three years are called the last stage. So after dividing it up
into these three stages, \[he attributes the three characteristics
thus:\] The materiality occurring in the first stage ceased there
without reaching the middle stage: therefore it is impermanent; what is
impermanent is painful; what is painful is not-self. Also the
materiality occurring in the middle stage ceased there without reaching
the last stage: therefore it is impermanent too and painful and
not-self. Also there is no materiality occurring in the thirty-three
years of the last stage that is capable of out-lasting death: therefore
that is impermanent too and painful and not-self. This is how he
attributes the three characteristics.



[50.]*2. (b)* Having attributed the three characteristics
according to "disappearance of what grows old in each stage" thus by
means of the first stage, etc., he again attributes the three
characteristics according to "disappearance of what grows old in each
stage" by means of the following ten decades: the tender decade, the
sport decade, the beauty decade, the strength decade, the understanding
decade, the decline decade, the stooping decade, the bent decade, the
dotage decade, and the prone decade.



[51.]Herein, as to these decades: in the first place, the first
ten years of a person with a hundred years' life are called the *tender
decade*; for then he is a tender unsteady child. The next ten years are
called the *sport decade*; for he is very fond of sport then. The next
ten years are called the *beauty decade*; for his beauty reaches its
full extent then. The next ten years are called the *strength decade*;
for his strength and power reach their full extent then. The next ten
years are called the *understanding decade*; for his understanding is
well established by then. Even in one naturally weak in understanding
some understanding, it seems, arises at that time. The next ten years
are called the *decline decade*; for his fondness for sport and his
beauty, strength, and understanding decline then. The next ten years are
called the *stooping decade*; for his figure \[620\] stoops forward
then. The next ten years are called the *bent decade*; for his figure
becomes bent like the end of a plough then. The next ten years are
called the *dotage decade*; for he is doting then and forgets what he
does. The next ten years are called the *prone decade*; for a
centenarian mostly lies prone.



[52.] Herein, in order to attribute the three characteristics
according to "disappearance of what grows old in each stage" by means of
these decades, the meditator considers thus: The materiality occurring
in the first decade ceases there without reaching the second decade:
therefore it is impermanent, painful, not-self. The materiality
occurring in the second decade ... the materiality



[]



[]



occurring in the ninth decade ceases there without reaching the tenth
decade; the materiality occurring in the tenth decade ceases there
without reaching the next becoming: therefore it is impermanent,
painful, not-self. That is how he attributes the three characteristics.



[53.]*2. (c)* Having attributed the three characteristics
according to "disappear- ance of what grows old in each stage" thus by
means of the decades, he again attributes the three characteristics
according to "disappearance of what grows old in each stage" by taking
that same hundred years in twenty parts of five years each.



[54.] How? He considers thus: The materiality occurring in the
first five years ceases there without reaching the second five years:
therefore it is impermanent, painful, not-self. The materiality
occurring in the second five years ... in the third ... in the
nineteenth five years ceases there without reaching the twentieth five
years. There is no materiality occurring in the twentieth five years
that is capable of outlasting death; therefore that is impermanent too,
painful, not-self.



[55.]*2. (d)* Having attributed the three characteristics
according to "disappear- ance of what grows old in each stage" thus by
means of the twenty parts, he again attributes the three characteristics
according to "disappearance of what grows old in each stage" by taking
twenty-five parts of four years each. (e) Next, by taking thirty-three
parts of three years each, (f) by taking fifty parts of two years each,
(g) by taking a hundred parts of one year each.



*2. (h)* Next he attributes the three characteristics according to
"disappearance of what grows old in each stage" by means of each of the
three seasons, taking each year in three parts.



[56.]How? The materiality occurring in the four months of the
rains (*vassāna*) ceases there without reaching the winter (*hemanta*).
The materiality occurring in the winter ceases there without reaching
the summer (*gimha*). The materiality occurring in the summer ceases
there without reaching the rains again: therefore it is impermanent,
\[621\] painful, not-self.



[57.]*2. (i)* Having attributed them thus, he again takes one
year in six parts and attributes the three characteristics to this
materiality according to "disappearance of what grows old in each stage"
thus: The materiality occurring in the two months of the rains
(*vassāna*) ceases there without reaching the autumn (*sarada*). The
materiality occurring in the autumn ... in the winter (*hemanta*) *...*
in the cool (*sisira*) ... in the spring (*vasanta*) ... the materiality
occurring in the summer (*gimha*) ceases there without reaching the
rains again: therefore it is impermanent too, painful, not-self.



[58.]*2. (j)* Having attributed them thus, he next attributes
the characteristics by means of the dark and bright halves of the moon
thus: The materiality occurring in the dark half of the moon ceases
there without reaching the bright half; the materiality occurring in the
bright half ceases there without reaching the dark half: therefore it is
impermanent, painful, not-self.



[59.]*2. (k)* Next he attributes the three characteristics by
means of night and day thus: The materiality occurring in the night
ceases there without reaching the



[]



[]



day; the materiality occurring in the day ceases there without reaching
the night: therefore it is impermanent, painful, not-self.



[60.]*2. (l)* Next he attributes the three characteristics by
taking that same day in six parts beginning with the morning thus: The
materiality occurring in the morning ceased there without reaching the
noon; the materiality occurring in the noon ... without reaching the
evening; the materiality occurring in the evening ... the first watch;
the materiality occurring in the first watch ... the middle watch; the
materiality occurring in the middle watch ceased there without reaching
the last watch; the materiality occurring in the last watch ceased there
without reaching the morning again: therefore it is impermanent,
painful, not- self.



[61.] *2. (m)* Having attributed them thus, he again attributes
the three characteristics to that same materiality by means of moving
forward and moving backward, looking toward and looking away, bending
and stretching, thus: The materiality occurring in the moving forward
ceases there without reaching the moving backward; the materiality
occurring in the moving backward ... the looking toward; the materiality
occurring in the looking toward ... the looking away; the materiality
occurring in the looking away ... the bending; the materiality occurring
in the bending ceases there without reaching the stretching: therefore
it is impermanent, painful, not-self (cf. M-a I 260).



[62.] *2. (n)* Next he divides a single footstep into six parts
as "lifting up," "shifting forward," "shifting sideways," "lowering
down," "placing down," and "fixing down21."



[63.] Herein,  *lifting up* is raising the foot from the
ground. *Shifting forward* is shifting it to the front. *Shifting
sideways* is moving the foot to one side or the other in seeing a thorn,
stump, snake, and so on. *Lowering down* is letting the foot down.
\[622\] *Placing down* is putting the foot on the ground. *Fixing down*
is pressing the foot on the ground while the other foot is being lifted
up.



[64.]Herein, in the *lifting up* two elements, the earth
element and the water element, are subordinate22 and sluggish while the
other two are predominant and strong. Likewise in the *shifting forward*
and  *shifting sideways.* In the *lowering down* two elements, the fire
element and the air element, are subordinate and sluggish while the
other two are predominant and strong. Likewise in the *placing down*
and  *fixing down.*



He attributes the three characteristics to materiality according to
"disappearance of what grows old in each stage" by means of these six
parts into which he has thus divided it.



[65.]How? He considers thus: The elements and the kinds of
derived materiality occurring in the lifting up all ceased there without
reaching the shifting forward: therefore they are impermanent, painful,
not-self. Likewise those occurring in



[21.] *Vītiharaṇa---*"shifting sideways,"
*sannikkhepana---*"placing down," and *sannirujjhana---*"fixing down,"
are not in PED; cf. M-a I 260.



22\. *Omatta---*"subordinate": not in PED.



[]



[]



the shifting forward ... the shifting sideways; those occurring in the
shifting sideways ... the lowering down; those occurring in the lowering
down ... the placing down; those occurring in the placing down cease
there without reaching the fixing down; thus formations keep breaking
up, like crackling sesame seeds put into a hot pan; wherever they arise,
there they cease stage by stage, section by section, term by term, each
without reaching the next part: therefore they are impermanent, painful,
not-self.



[66.] When he sees formations stage by stage with insight thus,
his comprehension of materiality has become subtle. Here is a simile for
its subtlety. A border dweller, it seems, who was familiar with torches
of wood and grass, etc., but had never seen a lamp before, came to a
city. Seeing a lamp burning in the market, he asked a man, "I say, what
is that lovely thing called?"---"What is lovely about that? It is called
a lamp. Where it goes to when its oil and wick are used up no one
knows." Another told him, "That is crudely put; for the flame in each
third portion of the wick as it gradually burns up ceases there without
reaching the other parts." Other told him, "That is crudely put too; for
the flame in each inch, in each half-inch, in each thread, in each
strand, will cease without reaching the other strands; but the flame
cannot appear without a strand."



[67.] \[623\] Herein, the meditator's attribution of the three
characteristics to materiality delimited by the hundred years as "taking
up" and "putting down" is like the man's knowledge stated thus, "Where
it goes when its oil and wick are used up no one knows." The meditator's
attribution of the three characteristics according to "disappearance of
what grows old in each stage" to the materiality delimited by the third
part of the hundred years is like the man's knowledge stated thus, "The
flame in each third portion of the wick ceases without reaching the
other parts." The meditator's attribution of the three characteristics
to materiality delimited by the periods of ten, five, four, three, two
years, one year, is like the man's knowledge stated thus, "The flame in
each inch will cease without reaching the others." The meditator's
attribution of the three characteristics to materiality delimited by the
four-month and two-month periods by classing the year as threefold and
sixfold respectively according to the seasons is like the man's
knowledge stated thus, "The flame in each half-inch will cease without
reaching the others." The meditator's attribution of the three
characteristics to materiality delimited by means of the dark and bright
halves of the moon, by means of night and day, and by means of morning,
etc., taking one night and day in six parts, is like the man's knowledge
stated thus, "The flame in each thread will cease without reaching the
others." The meditator's attribution of the three characteristics to
materiality delimited by means of each part, namely, "moving forward,"
etc., and "lifting up," etc., is like the man's knowledge stated thus,
"The flame in each strand will cease without reaching the others."



[68.] *3--6. * Having in various ways thus attributed the three
characteristics to materiality according to "disappearance of what grows
old in each stage," he analyzes that same materiality and divides it
into four portions as "arising from nutriment," etc., and he again
attributes the three characteristics to each portion.



[]



[]



*3.* Herein, materiality *arising from nutriment* becomes evident to him
through hunger and its satisfaction. For materiality that is originated
when one is hungry is parched and stale, and it is as ugly and
disfigured as a parched stump, as a crow perching in a charcoal pit.
That originated when hunger is satisfied is plump, fresh, tender, smooth
and soft to touch. Discerning that, he attributes the three
characteristics to it thus: The materiality occurring when hunger is
satisfied ceases there without reaching the time when one is hungry;
therefore it is impermanent, painful, not-self.



[69.] *4.* That *arising from temperature* becomes evident
through cool and heat. For materiality that is originated when it is hot
is parched, stale and ugly. \[624\] Materiality originated by cool
temperature is plump, fresh, tender, smooth, and soft to touch.
Discerning that, he attributes the three characteristics to it thus: The
materiality occurring when it is hot ceases there without reaching the
time when it is cool. The materiality occurring when it is cool ceases
there without reaching the time when it is hot: therefore it is
impermanent, painful, not-self.



[70.]*5. The kamma-born* becomes evident through the sense
doors, that is, the base \[of consciousness\]. For in the case of the
eye door there are thirty material instances with decads of the eye, the
body, and sex; but with the twenty-four instances originated by
temperature, consciousness, and nutriment, \[that is to say, three bare
octads,\] which are their support, there are fifty-four. Likewise in the
case of the doors of the ear, nose, and tongue. In the case of the body
door there are forty-four with the decads of body and sex and the
instances originated by temperature, and so on. In the case of the mind
door there are fifty-four, too, with the decads of the heart-basis, the
body, and sex, and those instances originated by the temperature, and so
on. Discerning all that materiality, he attributes the three
characteristics to it thus: The materiality occurring in the eye door
ceases there without reaching the ear door; the materiality occurring in
the ear door ... the nose door; the materiality occurring in the nose
door ... the tongue door; the materiality occurring in the tongue door
... the body door; the materiality occurring in the body door ceases
there without reaching the mind door: therefore it is impermanent,
painful, not-self.



[71.] The consciousness-originated becomes evident
through \[the behaviour of\] one who is joyful or grieved. For the
materiality arisen at the time when he is joyful is smooth, tender,
fresh and soft to touch. That arisen at the time when he is grieved is
parched, stale and ugly. Discerning that, he attributes the three
characteristics to it thus: The materiality occurring at the time when
one is joyful ceases there without reaching the time when one is
grieved; the materiality occurring at the time when one is grieved
ceases there without reaching the time when one is joyful: therefore it
is impermanent, painful, not-self.



[72.] When he discerns consciousness-originated materiality and
attributes the



three characteristics to it in this way, this meaning becomes evident to
him:



Life, person, pleasure, pain just these alone\
Join in one conscious moment that flicks by.\
Gods, though they live for four-and-eighty thousand\
Eons, are not the same for two such moments. \[625\]



[]



[]



Ceased aggregates of those dead or alive\
Are all alike, gone never to return;\
And those that break up meanwhile, and in future,\
Have traits no different from those ceased before.



No \[world is\] born if \[consciousness is\] not\
Produced; when that is present, then it lives;\
When consciousness dissolves, the world is dead:\
The highest sense this concept will allow.



No store of broken states, no future stock;\
Those born balance like seeds on needle points.\
Breakup of states is foredoomed at their birth;\
Those present decay, unmingled with those past.\
They come from nowhere, break up, nowhere go;\
Flash in and out, as lightning in the sky23 (Nidd I 42).



[73.]Having attributed the three characteristics
to that arising from nutriment, etc., he again attributes the three
characteristics to natural materiality. *Natural materiality* is a name
for external materiality that is not bound up with faculties and arises
along with the eon of world expansion, for example, iron, copper, tin,
lead, gold, silver, pearl, gem, beryl, conch shell, marble, coral, ruby,
opal, soil, stone, rock, grass, tree, creeper, and so on (see Vibh 83).
That becomes evident to him by means of an asoka-tree shoot.



[74.] For that to begin with is pale pink; then in two or three
days it becomes dense red, again in two or three days it becomes dull
red, next \[brown,\] the colour of a tender \[mango\] shoot; next, the
colour of a growing shoot; next, the colour of pale leaves; next, the
colour of dark green leaves. After it has become the colour of dark
green leaves, as it follows out the successive stages of such material
continuity, it eventually becomes withered foliage, and at the end of
the year it breaks loose from its stem and falls off.



[75.] Discerning that, he attributes the three characteristics
to it thus: The materiality occurring when it is pale pink ceases there
without reaching the time when it is dense red; the materiality
occurring when it is dense red ... dull red; the materiality occurring
when it is dull red ... the colour of a tender \[mango\] shoot; the
materiality occurring when it is the colour of a tender \[mango\] shoot
... the colour of a growing shoot; the materiality occurring when it is
the colour of a growing shoot ... the colour of pale green leaves; the
materiality occurring



23\. This verse is quoted twice in the Mahāniddesa (Nidd I 42 & 118).
For Vism-mhṭ's comment see Ch. VIII, note 11. Vism-mhṭ and the Sinhalese
translation have been taken as guides in rendering this rather difficult
verse. There is another stanza in the Niddesa not quoted here:\
"... this concept will allow.\
States happen as their tendencies dictate;\
And they are modelled by desire; their stream\
Uninterruptedly flows ever on\
Conditioned by the sixfold base of contact.\
No store of broken states ..."

when it is the colour of pale green leaves ... the colour of dark green
leaves; the materiality occurring when it is the colour of dark green
leaves ... the time when it is withered foliage; the materiality
occurring when it is withered foliage ceases there without \[626\]
reaching the time when it breaks loose from its stem and falls off:
therefore it is impermanent, painful, not-self.



He comprehends all natural materiality in this way.



This is how, firstly, he comprehends formations by attributing the three



characteristics to them by means of the material septad.



\[THE  IMMATERIAL  SEPTAD\]



[76.]The headings of what was called above "the immaterial
septad" are these: (1) by groups, (2) by pairs, (3) by moments, (4) by
series, (5) by removal of \[false\] view, (6) by abolition of conceit,
(7) by ending of attachment.



[77.]Herein, *by groups* means the states
belonging to the contact pentad.24 How? Here, "he comprehends by groups"
\[means that\] a bhikkhu considers thus: The states belonging to the
contact pentad arising in the comprehending of head hairs as
"impermanent, painful, not-self"; the states belonging to the contact
pentad arising in the comprehending of body hairs as ... in the
contemplation of brain as "impermanent, painful, not-self"---all these
states disintegrate section by section, term by term, like crackling
sesame seeds put into a hot pan, each without reaching the next:
therefore they are impermanent, painful, not-self. This, firstly, is the
method according to the Discourse on Purification.25



[78.]According to the Discourse on the Noble Ones' Heritages,
however, he is said to "comprehend by groups" when by means of a
subsequent consciousness he comprehends as "impermanent, painful,
not-self" that consciousness which occurred \[comprehending\]
materiality as "impermanent, painful, not-self" in the seven instances
of the material septad given above. As this method is more suitable we
shall therefore confine ourselves to it in explaining the rest.



[79.]*2. By pairs:* after the bhikkhu has comprehended as
"impermanent, painful, not-self" the materiality of the "taking up and
putting down" (§46f.), he comprehends that consciousness \[with which he
was comprehending the materiality\] too as "impermanent, painful,
not-self" by means of a subsequent consciousness. After he has
comprehended as "impermanent, painful, not-self" the materiality of the
"disappearance of what grows old in each stage" and that "arising from
nutriment," "arising from temperature," "kamma-born,"
"consciousness-originated" and "natural," he comprehends that
consciousness too as "impermanent, painful, not-self" by means of a
subsequent consciousness. In this way he is said to comprehend by pairs.



24\. The "contact pentad" (*phassa-pañcamaka*) is a term used for the
first five things listed in Dhs §1, that is, contact, feeling,
perception, volition, and consciousness, which are invariably present
whenever there is consciousness.\



25\. The "Discourse on Purification" (*visuddhi-kathā*) and the
"Discourse on the Noble Ones' Heritages" (*ariyavaṃsa-kathā*) are
presumably names of chapters in the old Sinhalese commentaries no longer
extant.



[]



[]



[80.]*3. By moments*: after the bhikkhu has comprehended as
"impermanent, pain- ful, not-self" the materiality of the "taking up and
putting down," he comprehends that first consciousness \[with which he
was comprehending the materiality\] as "impermanent, painful, not-self"
by means of a second consciousness, and that second consciousness by
means of a third, and the third by means of a fourth, and the fourth by
means of a fifth, and that too he comprehends as "impermanent, painful,
not-self." After he has comprehended as "impermanent, painful, not-self"
the materiality of "disappearance of what grows old in each stage" and
that "aris- ing from nutriment," "arising from temperature," \[627\]
"kamma-born," "conscious- ness-originated" and "natural," he comprehends
that first consciousness as "im- permanent, painful, not-self" by means
of a second consciousness, and that second consciousness by means of a
third, and the third by means of a fourth, and the fourth by means of a
fifth, and that too he comprehends as "impermanent, painful, not-self."
Comprehending thus four \[consciousnesses\] from each discerning of
materiality he is said to comprehend by moments.



[81.] *4. By series*: after he has comprehended as
"impermanent, painful, not- self" the materiality of the "taking up and
putting down," he comprehends that first consciousness as "impermanent,
painful, not-self" by means of a second consciousness, and the second by
means of a third, and the third by means of a fourth ... and the tenth
by means of an eleventh, and that too he comprehends as "impermanent,
painful, not-self." After he has comprehended as "impermanent, painful,
not-self" the materiality of the "disappearance of what grows old in
each stage" and that "arising from nutriment," "arising from
temperature," "kamma-born," "consciousness-originated" and "natural," he
comprehends that consciousness as "impermanent, painful, not-self" by
means of a second consciousness, and the second by means of a third, ...
and the tenth by means of an eleventh, and that too he comprehends as
"impermanent, painful, not-self." It would be possible to go on
comprehending it in this way with serial insight even for a whole day.
But both the material meditation subject and the immaterial meditation
subject become familiar when the comprehending is taken as far as the
tenth consciousness. That is why it is said26 that it can be stopped at
the tenth. It is when he comprehends in this way that he is said to
comprehend by series.



[82.] *5.* *By removal of* \[*false*\] *view,* 6*. by abolition
of conceit*, 7. *by ending of attachment*: there is no individual method
for any of these three. But when he has discerned this materiality as
described above and this immateriality as described here, then he sees
that there is no living being over and above the material and the
immaterial. As soon as he no longer sees a being, the perception of a
being is removed. When he discerns formations with consciousness from
which perception of a being has been removed, then \[false\] view does
not arise in him. When \[false\] view does not arise in him, then
\[false\] view is said to be removed.



When he discerns formations with consciousness from which \[false\] view



has been removed, then conceit does not arise in him. When conceit does
not



[26.]"Said in the Discourse on the Noble Ones' Heritages"
(Vism-mhṭ 804).



[]



[]



arise, conceit is said to be abolished. When he discerns formations with
consciousness from which conceit has been abolished, then craving does
not arise in him. When craving does not arise in him, attachment is said
to be ended. This firstly is what is said in the Discourse on
Purification.



[83.]But in the Discourse on the Noble Ones' Heritages, after
setting forth the headings thus: "As removal of \[false\] view, as
abolition of conceit, as ending of attachment," the following method is
set forth: "There is no removal of \[false\] view in one who takes it
thus, 'I see with insight, my insight'; \[628\] there is removal of
\[false\] view in one who takes it thus, 'Only formations see formations
with insight, comprehend, define, discern, and delimit them.' There is
no abolition of conceit in one who takes it thus, 'I see thoroughly with
insight, I see well with insight'; there is abolition of conceit in one
who takes it thus, 'Only formations see formations with insight,
comprehend, define, discern, and delimit them.' There is no ending of
attachment in one who is pleased with insight thus, 'I am able to see
with insight'; there is ending of attachment in one who takes it thus,
'Only formations see formations with insight, comprehend, define,
discern, and delimit them.'



[84.]"There is removal of \[false\] view in one who sees thus:
'If formations were self, it would be right to take them as self; but
being not-self they are taken as self. Therefore they are not-self in
the sense of no power being exercisable over them; they are impermanent
in the sense of non-existence after having come to be; they are painful
in the sense of oppression by rise and fall.'



[85.] "There is abolition of conceit in one who sees thus: 'If
formations were permanent, it would be right to take them as permanent;
but being impermanent they are taken as permanent. Therefore they are
impermanent in the sense of non-existence after having come to be; they
are painful in the sense of oppression by rise and fall; they are
not-self in the sense of no power being exercisable over them.'



[86.]"There is ending of attachment in one who sees thus: 'If
formations were pleasant, it would be right to take them as pleasant;
but being painful they are taken as pleasant. Therefore they are painful
in the sense of oppression by rise and fall; they are impermanent in the
sense of non-existence after having come to be; they are not-self in the
sense of no power being exercisable over them.'



"Thus there comes to be the removal of \[false\] view in one who sees
formations as not-self; there comes to be the abolishing of conceit in
one who sees them as impermanent; there comes to be the ending of
attachment in one who sees them as painful. So this insight is valid in
each instance."



[88.] This is how he comprehends formations by attributing the
three



characteristics to them by means of the immaterial septad.



At this stage both the material meditation subject and the immaterial
meditation



subject have become familiar to him.



\[THE EIGHTEEN PRINCIPAL INSIGHTS\]



[89.]Having thus become familiar with the material and
immaterial meditation subjects, and so having penetrated here already a
part of those eighteen principal



[]



[]



insights27 which are later on to be attained in all their aspects by
means of full- understanding as abandoning starting with contemplation
of dissolution, he consequently abandons things opposed \[to what he has
already penetrated\].



[90.] *Eighteen principal insights* is a term for understanding
that consists in the kinds of insight beginning with contemplation of
impermanence. Now, as regards these: (1) One who develops the
contemplation of impermanence abandons the perception of permanence, (2)
one who develops the contemplation of pain \[629\] abandons the
perception of pleasure, (3) one who develops the contemplation of
not-self abandons the perception of self, (4) one who develops the
contemplation of dispassion abandons delighting, (5) one who develops
the contemplation of fading away abandons greed, (6) one who develops
the contemplation of cessation abandons origination, (7) one who
develops the contemplation of relinquishment abandons grasping, (8) one
who develops the contemplation of destruction abandons the perception of
compactness, (9) one who develops the contemplation of fall \[of
formations\] abandons accumulation \[of kamma\], (10) one who develops
the contemplation of change abandons the perception of lastingness, (11)
one who develops the contemplation of the signless abandons the sign,
(12) one who develops the contemplation of the desireless abandons
desire, (13) one who develops the contemplation of voidness abandons
misinterpreting (insistence), (14) one who develops the insight into
states that is higher understanding abandons misinterpreting
(insistence) due to grasping at a core, (15) one who develops correct
knowledge and vision abandons misinterpreting (insistence) due to
confusion, (16) one who develops the contemplation of danger abandons
misinterpreting (insistence) due to reliance, (17) one who develops the
contemplation of reflection abandons non-reflection, (18) one who
develops the contemplation of turning away abandons misinterpreting
(insistence) due to bondage (see Paṭis I 32f.).28



27\. The first seven of the eighteen principal insights are known as the
"seven contemplations"; see 20.4. Further descriptions are given in
XXII.113f.



28\. For Vism-mhṭ's comments on the first seven see note 3 to this
chapter. '*Contemplation of destruction*' is the contemplation of the
momentary dissolution of formations. '*Perception of compactness*' is
the assumption of unity in a continuity or mass or function or object.
'*Contemplation of destruction*' is contemplation of non- existence
after having been, they say. Contemplation of destruction is the
understanding by means of which he resolves the compact into its
elements and sees that it is impermanent in the sense of destruction.
Its completion starts with contemplation of dissolution, and so there is
abandoning of perception of compactness then, but before that there is
not, because it has not been completed. (9) The seeing of the
dissolution of formations both by actual experience and by inference and
the directing of attention to their cessation, in other words, their
dissolution, is *contemplation of fall*; through it accumulation \[of
kamma\] is abandoned; his consciousness does not incline with craving to
the occurrence of that \[aggregate-process of existence\] for the
purpose of which one accumulates \[kamma\]. (10) Seeing change in the
two ways through aging and through death in what is born, or seeing
another essence subsequent to the delimitation of such and such \[an
essence supervening\] in what was discerned by means of the material
septad, and so on, is '*contemplation of change*'; by its means he

[91.]Now the meditator has seen formations by means of the
three characteristics beginning with impermanence, and so he has
therefore already penetrated among these eighteen insights the
contemplations of impermanence, pain, and not-self. And then (1) the
contemplation of impermanence and (11) the contemplation of the signless
are one in meaning and different only in the letter, and so are (2) the
contemplation of pain and (12) the contemplation of the desireless, and
so are (3) the contemplation of not-self and (13) the contemplation of
voidness (see Paṭis II 63). Consequently these have been penetrated by
him as well. But (14) insight into states that is higher understanding
is all kinds of insight, and (15) correct knowledge and vision is
included in purification by overcoming doubt (Ch. XIX). Consequently,
these two have been penetrated by him as well. As to the remaining kinds
of insight, some have been penetrated and some not. We shall deal with
them below.29



abandons the '*perception of lastingness*,' the assumption of stability.
(11)--(13) The three beginning with '*contemplation of the signless*'
are the same as the three beginning with contemplation of impermanence.
(11) '*The sign*' is the mere appearance of formations as if graspable
entities, which is due to the individualization of particular functions
and which, owing to perception of unity in continuity and in mass, is
assumed to be temporarily enduring or permanent. (12) '*Desire*' is
longing for pleasure, or it is desire consisting in greed, and so on; it
means inclinationto formations owing to craving. (13)
'*Misinterpreting*' is misinterpreting as self. It is owing to their
opposing the '*sign*,' etc., that the contemplations of impermanence,
etc., are called by the names of 'signless,' etc.; so they should be
regarded as opposed to the apprehension of a sign, etc., just as they
are to the perception of permanence, and so on. (14) Insight that occurs
by knowing an object consisting of a visible datum, etc., and by seeing
the dissolution of the consciousness that had that visible datum, etc.,
as its object, and by apprehending voidness through the dissolution
thus, 'Only formations dissolve, there is nothing beyond the death of
formations,' is the higher understanding, and that is insight into
states, thus it is '*insight into states that is higher understanding*';
by its means he abandons the view accompanied by craving that is the
misinterpretation occurring as grasping at a permanent core, and so on.
(15) '*Correct knowledge and vision*' is a term for the seeing of
mentality-materiality with its conditions; by its means he abandons the
'*misinterpreting due to confusion*' that begins thus, 'Was I in the
past?' (M I 8) and that begins thus, 'Thus the world is created by an
Overlord' (?). (16) The knowledge consisting in the seeing of danger in
all kinds of becomings, etc., which has arisen owing to the appearance
of terror is '*contemplation of danger*'; by its means he abandons the
craving occurring as '*misinterpreting due to reliance*' because he does
not see any reliance or support. (17) The knowledge of reflection that
is the means to deliverance from formations is '*contemplation of
reflection*'; by its means he abandons the ignorance that is
'*non-reflection*' on impermanence, etc., and is opposed to reflection
on them. (18) Equanimity about formations and conformity knowledge are
'*contemplation of turning away*'; for owing to it the mind retreats and
recoils from all formations, like a water drop on a lotus leaf, so by
its means he abandons the '*misinterpretation due to bondage*,' which is
the occurrence of the defilements consisting of the fetters of sense
desire, and so on. (Vism-mh 806f.)\

established, then the contemplations of (6) cessation, (8) destruction,
(9) fall, and (10) change are

[92.] For it was with reference only to what has already been
penetrated that it was said above: "having thus become familiar with the
material and immaterial meditation subjects, and so having penetrated
here already a part of those eighteen principal insights, which are
later on to be attained in all their aspects by means of full
understanding as abandoning starting with contemplation of dissolution,
he consequently abandons things opposed \[to what he has already
penetrated\]" (§89).



\[KNOWLEDGE OF RISE AND FALL---I\]



[93.]Having purified his knowledge in this way by abandoning
the perceptions of permanence, etc., which oppose the contemplations of
impermanence, etc., he passes on from comprehension knowledge and begins
the task of attaining that of contemplation of rise and fall, which is
expressed thus: "Understanding \[630\] of contemplating present states'
change is knowledge of contemplation of rise and fall" (Paṭis I 1), and
which comes next after comprehension knowledge.



[94.]When he does so, he does it first in brief. Here is the
text: "How is it that understanding of contemplating present states'
change is knowledge of contemplation of rise and fall? Present
materiality is born \[materiality\]; the characteristic of its
generation is rise, the characteristic of its change is fall, the
contemplation is knowledge. Present feeling ... perception ...
formations ... consciousness ... eye ... (etc.) ... Present becoming is
born \[becoming\]; the characteristic of its generation is rise, the
characteristic of its change is fall, the contemplation is knowledge"
(Paṭis I 54).30



[95.] In accordance with the method of this text he sees the
characteristic of generation, the birth, the arising, the aspect of
renewal, of born materiality, as "rise," and he sees its characteristic
of change, its destruction, its dissolution, as "fall."



partly established. When (2) the contemplation of pain is established,
then the contemplations of (4) dispassion and (16) danger are partly
established. And when (3) the contemplation of not-self is established,
then the rest are partly established" (Vism-mhṭ 807).\



30\. "The interpreting of rise and fall must be done on a state that is
present according to continuity or present according to instant but not
on one that is past or future, which is why 'of present states' is said"
(Vism-mhṭ 808). "Present materiality is called born materiality; it is
included in the trio of instants \[of arising, presence and
dissolution\], is what is meant. But that is hard to discern at the
start, so the interpreting by insight should be done by means of
presence according to continuity" (Vism-mhṭ 808). For the elision
represented by "... (etc.) ..." see XX.9. In this case, however, the
last two members of the dependent origination are left out. "Although
states possessed of aging-and-death are mentioned under the heading of
birth and of aging- and-death in comprehension by groups, etc.,
nevertheless here in the description of knowledge of rise and fall, if
it were said 'present birth is born; the characteristic of its
generation is rise, the characteristic of its change is fall,' etc., it
would be tantamount to an affirmation and approval of the proposition
that birth and aging-and-death were possessed of birth and of
aging-and-death. So the text ends with 'becoming' in order to avoid
that" (Vism-mhṭ 808).



[]



[]



[96.] He understands thus: "There is no heap or store of
unarisen mentality- materiality \[existing\] prior to its arising. When
it arises, it does not come from any heap or store; and when it ceases,
it does not go in any direction. There is nowhere any depository in the
way of a heap or store or hoard of what has ceased. But just as there is
no store, prior to its arising, of the sound that arises when a lute is
played, nor does it come from any store when it arises, nor does it go
in any direction when it ceases, nor does it persist as a store when it
has ceased (cf. S IV 197), but on the contrary, not having been, it is
brought into being owing to the lute, the lute's neck, and the man's
appropriate effort, and having been, it vanishes---so too all material
and immaterial states, not having been, are brought into being, and
having been, they vanish."



[97.] Having given attention to rise and fall in brief thus, he
again \[does so in detail according to condition and instant by seeing
those characteristics\] as given in the exposition of that same
knowledge of rise and fall thus: "(1) He sees the rise of the
materiality aggregate in the sense of conditioned arising thus: With the
arising of ignorance there is the arising of materiality; (2) ... with
the arising of craving ... (3) ... with the arising of kamma ... (4) he
sees the rise of the materiality aggregate in the sense of conditioned
arising thus: With the arising of nutriment there is the arising of
materiality; (5) one who sees the characteristic of generation sees the
rise of the materiality aggregate. One who sees the rise of the
materiality aggregate sees these five characteristics.



"(1) He sees the fall of the materiality aggregate in the sense of
conditioned cessation thus: With the cessation of ignorance there is the
cessation of materiality; (2) ... with the cessation of craving ... (3)
... with the cessation of kamma ... (4) he sees the fall of the
materiality aggregate in the sense of conditioned cessation thus: With
the cessation of nutriment there is the cessation of materiality;
\[631\] (5) one who sees the characteristic of change sees the fall of
the materiality aggregate. One who sees the fall of the materiality
aggregate sees these five characteristics" (Paṭis I 55f.).



Likewise: "(1) He sees the rise of the feeling aggregate in the sense of
conditioned arising thus: With the arising of ignorance there is the
arising of feeling; (2) ... with the arising of craving ... (3) ... with
the arising of kamma ... (4) he sees the rise of the feeling aggregate
in the sense of conditioned arising thus: With the arising of contact
there is the arising of feeling; (5) one who sees the characteristic of
generation sees the rise of the feeling aggregate. One who sees the rise
of the feeling aggregate sees those five characteristics.



"(1) He sees the fall of the feeling aggregate in the sense of
conditioned cessation thus: With the cessation of ignorance there is the
cessation of feeling; (2) ... with the cessation of craving ... (3) ...
with the cessation of kamma ... (4) he sees the fall of the feeling
aggregate in the sense of conditioned cessation thus: With the cessation
of contact there is the cessation of feeling; (5) one who sees the
characteristic of change sees the fall of the feeling aggregate. One who
sees the fall of the feeling aggregate sees these five characteristics"
(Paṭis I 55f.).



And as in the case of the feeling aggregate, \[that is, substituting
"contact" for



the "nutriment" in the case of materiality,\] so for the perception and
formations



[]



[]



aggregates. So also for the consciousness aggregate with this
difference, that for the phrases containing "contact" there are
substituted "with the arising of mentality-materiality" and "with the
cessation of mentality-materiality."



So there are fifty characteristics stated with the ten in the case of
each aggregate by seeing rise and fall, by means of which he gives
attention in detail *according to condition* and *according to instant*
(*moment*) in this way: "The rise of materiality is thus; its fall is
thus; so it rises, so it falls."



[98.] As he does so his knowledge becomes clearer thus: "So, it
seems, these



states, not having been, are brought into being; having been, they
vanish."



When he thus sees rise and fall in the two ways, according to condition
and according to instant, the several truths, aspects of the dependent
origination, methods, and characteristics become evident to him.



[99.]When he sees the arising of aggregates with the arising of
ignorance and the cessation of aggregates with the cessation of
ignorance, this is his seeing of rise and fall *according to condition.*
When he sees the rise and fall of aggregates by seeing the
characteristic of generation and the characteristic of change, this is
his seeing of rise and fall *according to instant.* For it is only at
the instant of arising that there is the characteristic of generation,
and only at the instant of dissolution that there is the characteristic
of change.



[100.]So when he sees rise and fall in the two ways, according
to condition and according to instant thus, the *truth* of origination
becomes evident to him through seeing rise according to condition owing
to his discovery of the progenitor. \[632\] The truth of suffering
becomes evident to him through seeing rise according to instant owing to
his discovery of the suffering due to birth. The truth of cessation
becomes evident to him through seeing fall according to condition owing
to his discovery of the non-arising of things produced by conditions
when their conditions do not arise. The truth of suffering becomes
evident to him too through seeing fall according to instant owing to his
discovery of the suffering due to death. And his seeing of rise and fall
becomes evident to him as the truth of the path thus: "This is the
mundane path" owing to abolition of confusion about it.



[101.]The *dependent origination* in forward order becomes
evident to him through seeing rise according to condition owing to his
discovery that "When this exists, that comes to be" (M I 262). The
dependent origination in reverse order becomes evident to him through
seeing fall according to condition owing to his discovery that "When
this does not exist, that does not come to be" (M I 264). Dependently-
arisen states become evident to him through seeing rise and fall
according to instant owing to his discovery of the characteristic of the
formed; for the things possessed of rise and fall are formed and
conditionally arisen.



[102.]The *method* of identity becomes evident to him through
seeing rise according to condition owing to his discovery of unbroken
continuity in the connection of cause with fruit. Then he more
thoroughly abandons the annihilation view. The method of diversity
becomes evident to him through seeing rise according to instant owing to
his discovery that each \[state\] is new \[as it arises\]. Then he more
thoroughly abandons the eternity view. The method of uninterestedness
becomes evident to



[]



[]



him through seeing rise and fall according to condition owing to his
discovery of the inability of states to have mastery exercised over
them. Then he more thoroughly abandons the self view. The method of
ineluctable regularity becomes evident to him through seeing rise
according to condition owing to his discovery of the arising of the
fruit when the suitable conditions are there. Then he more thoroughly
abandons the moral-inefficacy-of-action view.



[103.]The  *characteristic * of not-self becomes evident to him
through seeing rise according to condition owing to his discovery that
states have no curiosity and that their existence depends upon
conditions. The characteristic of impermanence becomes evident to him
through seeing rise and fall according to instant owing to his discovery
of non-existence after having been and owing to his discovery that they
are secluded from past and future. The characteristic of pain becomes
evident to him \[through that\] too owing to his discovery of oppression
by rise and fall. And the characteristic of individual essence becomes
evident to him \[through that\] too owing to his discovery of
delimitation \[of states\] by rise and fall.31 And in the characteristic
of individual essence the temporariness of the characteristic of what is
formed becomes evident to him \[through that\] too owing to his
discovery of the non-existence of fall at the instant of rise and the
non- existence of rise at the instant of fall.32



[104.]When the several truths, aspects of the dependent
origination, methods, and characteristics have become evident to him
thus, then formations appear to him as perpetually renewed: "So these
states, it seems, being previously unarisen, critic, and being arisen,
they cease." \[633\] And they are not only perpetually renewed, but they
are also short-lived like dew-drops at sunrise (A IV 137), like a bubble
on water (S III 14 I), like a line drawn on water (A IV 137), like a
mustard seed on an awl's point (Nidd I 42), like a lightning flash (Nidd
I 43). And they appear without core, like a conjuring trick (S III 141),
like a mirage (Dhp 46), like a dream (Sn 807)*,* like the circle of a
whirling firebrand (source untraced), like a goblin city (source
untraced), like froth (Dhp 46), like a plantain trunk (S III 142), and
so on.



At this point he has attained tender insight-knowledge called
contemplation of rise and fall, which has become established by
penetrating the fifty characteristics in this manner: "Only what is
subject to fall arises; and to be arisen necessitates fall." With the
attainment of this he is known as a "beginner of insight."



\[THE TEN IMPERFECTIONS OF INSIGHT\]



[105.]



Now, when he is a beginner of insight with this tender insight, ten
imperfections of insight arise in him. For imperfections of insight do
not arise either in a noble disciple who has reached penetration \[of
the truths\] or in persons



31\. "With the seeing of rise and fall not only the characteristics of
impermanence and pain become evident, but also the characteristics, in
other words, the individual essences, of earth, contact, etc., termed
hardness, touching, etc., respectively, become clearly evident and
discrete (*avacchinna*) in their individual essences" (Vism-mhṭ 814).



32\. "The inclusion of only rise and fall here is because this kind of
knowledge occurs as seeing only rise and fall, not because of
non-existence of the instant of presence" (Vism-mhṭ 814). See
Introduction, note 18.



[]



[]



erring in virtue, neglectful of their meditation subject and idlers.
They arise only in a clansman who keeps to the right course, devotes
himself continuously \[to his meditation subject\] and is a beginner of
insight. But what are these ten imperfections? They are: (1)
illumination, (2) knowledge, (3) rapturous happiness, (4) tranquillity,
(5) bliss (pleasure), (6) resolution, (7) exertion, (8) assurance, (9)
equanimity, and (10) attachment.



[106.]For this is said: "How does the mind come to be seized by
agitation about higher states? When a man is bringing \[formations\] to
mind as impermanent, illumination arises in him. He adverts to the
illumination thus, 'Illumination is a \[Noble One's\] state.'33 The
distraction due to that is agitation. When his mind is seized by that
agitation, he does not understand correctly \[their\] appearance as
impermanent, he does not understand correctly \[their\] appearance as
painful, he does not understand correctly \[their\] appearance as
not-self.



"Likewise, when he is bringing \[formations\] to mind as impermanent,
knowledge arises in him ... happiness ... tranquillity ... bliss ...
resolution ... exertion ... establishment ... equanimity ... attachment
arises in him. He adverts to the attachment thus, 'Attachment is a
\[Noble One's\] state.' The distraction due to that is agitation. When
his mind is seized by that agitation, he does not correctly understand
\[their\] appearance as impermanent, \[634\] he does not correctly
understand \[their\] appearance as painful, he does not correctly
understand \[their\] appearance as not-self" (Paṭis II 100).



[107.]*1. * Herein, illumination is illumination due to
insight.34 When it arises, the meditator thinks, "Such illumination
never arose in me before. I have surely reached the path, reached
fruition;" thus he takes what is not the path to be the path and what is
not fruition to be fruition. When he takes what is not the path to be
the path



33\. "He adverts to it as Nibbāna or as the path or as fruition"
(Vism-mhṭ 816). "The agitation, the distraction, that occurs about
whether or not the illumination, etc., are noble states is '*agitation
about higher states'*" (Vism-mhṭ 815). In this connection Vism- mhṭ
quotes the following text: "Friends, any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī who
declares the attainment of Arahantship in my presence has always arrived
there by four paths or by one of them. What four? Here, friends, a
bhikkhu develops insight preceded by serenity. While he is developing
insight preceded by serenity the path is born in him. He cultivates,
develops, repeats that path. As he does so his fetters are abandoned and
his inherent tendencies are brought to an end. Again, friends, a bhikkhu
develops serenity preceded by insight ... He develops serenity and
insight yoked equally. Again, friends, a bhikkhu's mind is seized by
agitation about highest states. When that consciousness settles down
internally, becomes steady, unified and concentrated, then the path is
born in him ... his inherent tendencies are brought to an end" (A II
157).\



34\. "'*Illumination due to insight*' is the luminous materiality
originated by insight consciousness, and that originated by temperature
belonging to his own continuity. Of these, that originated by insight
consciousness is bright and is found only in the meditator's body. The
other kind is independent of his body and spreads all round over what is
capable of being experienced by knowledge. It becomes manifest to him
too, and he sees anything material in the place touched by it" (Vism-mhṭ
816).



[]

and what is not fruition to be fruition, the course of his insight is
interrupted. He drops his own basic meditation subject and sits just
enjoying the illumination.



[108.]But this illumination arises in one bhikkhu illuminating
only as much as the seat he is sitting on; in another, the interior of
his room; in another, the exterior of his room; in another the whole
monastery ... a quarter league ... a half league ... a league ... two
leagues ... three leagues; in another bhikkhu it arises making a single
light from the earth's surface up to the Brahmā-world. But in the
Blessed One it arose illuminating the ten-thousandfold world-element.



[109.] This story illustrates how it varies. Two elders, it
seems, were sitting inside a room with a double wall at Cittalapabbata.
It was the Uposatha of the dark of the moon that day. All directions
were covered by a blanket of cloud, and at night the four-factored
gloom35 prevailed. Then one elder said, "Venerable sir, the flowers of
the five colours on the lion table on the shrine terrace are visible to
me now." The other said, "What you say is nothing wonderful, friend.
Actually the fishes and turtles in the ocean a league away are visible
to me now."



[110.]This imperfection of insight usually arises in one who
has acquired serenity and insight. Because the defilements suppressed by
the attainments do not manifest themselves, he thinks, "I am an
Arahant," like the Elder Mahā-Nāga who lived at Uccavālika, like the
Elder Mahā-Datta who lived at Haṅkana, like the Elder Cūḷa- Sumana who
lived in the Nikapenna meditation house at Cittalapabbata.



[111.]Here is one story as an illustration. The Elder
Dhammadinna, it seems, who lived at Talaṅgara---one of the great ones
with cankers destroyed who possessed the categories of
discrimination---was the instructor of a large community of bhikkhus.
One day, as he was sitting in his own daytime quarters, he wondered,
"Has our teacher, the Elder Mahā-Nāga who lives at Uccavālika, \[635\]
brought his work of asceticism to its conclusion, or not?" He saw that
he was still an ordinary man, and he knew that if he did not go to him,
he would die an ordinary man. He rose up into the air with supernormal
power and alighted near the elder, who was sitting in his daytime
quarters. He paid homage to him, doing his duty, and sat down at one
side. To the question, "Why have you come unexpectedly, friend
Dhammadinna?" he replied, "I have come to ask a question, venerable
sir." He was told, "Ask, friend. If we know, we shall say." He asked a
thousand questions.



[112.]The elder replied without hesitation to each question. To
the remark, "Your knowledge is very keen, venerable sir; when was this
state attained by you?" he replied, "Sixty years ago, friend." "Do you
practice concentration, venerable sir?"--- "That is not difficult,
friend."---"Then make an elephant, venerable sir." The elder made an
elephant all white. "Now, venerable sir, make that elephant come
straight at you with his ears outstretched, his tail extended, putting
his trunk in his mouth and making a horrible trumpeting." The elder did
so. Seeing the frightful aspect of the rapidly approaching elephant, he
sprang up and made to run away. Then the elder with cankers destroyed
put out his hand, and catching him by the hem of his robe, he said,
"Venerable sir, is there any timidity in one whose cankers are
destroyed?"



35\. *Caturaṅga-samannāgataṃ tamaṃ---*"four-factored gloom" is mentioned
also at S-a I 170, M-a V 16 (c. *andhakāra*), and Ud-a 66, 304.



[]



[]



[113.] Then he recognized that he was still an ordinary man. He
knelt at Dhammadinna's feet and said, "Help me, friend
Dhammadinna."---"Venerable sir, I will help you; that is why I came. Do
not worry." Then he expounded a meditation subject to him. The elder
took the meditation subject and went up on to the walk, and with the
third footstep he reached Arahantship. The elder was a bhikkhu of hating
temperament, it seems. Such bhikkhus waver on account of illumination.



[114.]*2. Knowledge* is knowledge due to insight. As he is
estimating and judging material and immaterial states perhaps knowledge
that is unerring, keen, incisive, and very sharp arises in him, like a
lightning flash.



[115.] *3. Rapturous happiness* is happiness due to insight.
Perhaps at that time the five kinds of happiness, namely, minor
happiness, momentary happiness, showering happiness, uplifting
happiness, and pervading (rapturous) happiness arise in him filling his
whole body.



[116.] *4. Tranquillity* is tranquillity due to insight. As he
is sitting at that time in his night or day quarters perhaps \[636\]
there is no fatigue or heaviness or rigidity or unwieldiness or sickness
or crookedness in his body and his mind, but rather his body and mind
are tranquillized, light, malleable, wieldy, quite sharp, and straight.
With his body and mind aided by this tranquillity, etc., he experiences
at that time the superhuman delight with reference to which it is said:



A bhikkhu when his mind is quiet\
Retires to an empty place,\
And his right insight in the Dhamma\
Gives him superhuman delight.\
It is because he comprehends\
The rise and fall of aggregates\
That he finds happiness and joy\
And knows it to be deathless (Dhp 373f.).



This is how tranquillity, associated with lightness, etc., arises in
him, bringing



about this superhuman delight.



[117.] *5. Bliss* (*pleasure*) is bliss due to insight. At that
time perhaps there arises in him exceedingly refined bliss (pleasure)
flooding his whole body.



[118.] *6. Resolution* is faith. For strong faith arises in him
in association with



insight in the form of extreme confidence of consciousness and its
concomitants.



[119.]*7. Exertion* is energy. For well-exerted energy, neither
too lax nor too strained, arises in him in association with insight.



[120.]*8. Assurance* (lit. establishment) is mindfulness. For
well-established (well- assured), well-founded mindfulness, which is dug
in and as immovable as the king of mountains, arises in him in
association with insight. Whatever subject he adverts to, consciously
reacts to, gives attention to, reviews, appears to him (he is assured
of) owing to mindfulness, which descends into it,36 enters into it, just
as the other world does to one who has the divine eye.



[36.]*Okkhandati---*"to descend into": not in PED; see XXII.34
and M-a I 238.



[]



[]



[121.]*9. Equanimity* is both equanimity about insight and
equanimity in adverting.37 For equanimity about insight, which is
neutrality about formations, arises strongly in him at that time. It is
also equanimity in adverting in the mind door. For whatever the subject
he adverts to, his adverting works as incisively and sharply as a
lightning flash, like a red-hot spear plunged into a basket of leaves.



[122.]10. *Attachment* is attachment due to insight. For when
his insight is adorned with illumination, etc., attachment arises in
him, which is subtle and peaceful in aspect, and it relies on (clings
to) that insight; and he is not able to discern that attachment as a
defilement. \[637\]



[123.]And as in the case of illumination, so too in the case of
the other imperfections that may arise, the meditator thinks thus: "Such
knowledge ... such rapturous happiness ... tranquillity ... bliss ...
resolution ... exertion ... assurance ... equanimity ... attachment
never arose in me before. I have surely reached the path, reached
fruition." Thus he takes what is not the path to be the path and what is
not fruition to be fruition. When he takes what is not the path to be
the path and what is not fruition to be fruition, the course of his
insight is interrupted. He drops his basic meditation subject and sits
just enjoying the attachment.



[124.] And here illumination, etc., are called imperfections
because they are the basis for imperfection, not because they are
\[kammically\] unprofitable. But attachment is both an imperfection and
the basis for imperfection.



As basis only they amount to ten; but with the different ways of taking
them



they come to thirty.



[125.] How? When a man takes it thus, "illumination has arisen
in me," his way of taking is due to \[false\] view. When he takes it
thus, "How agreeable this illumination that has arisen is," his way of
taking is due to pride (conceit). When he relishes the illumination, his
way of taking is due to craving. So there are three ways of taking it in
the case of illumination, that is to say, due to \[false\] view, to
pride (conceit), and to craving. Likewise with the rest. So they come to
thirty with the three ways of taking them. Owing to their influence an
unskilful, unwary meditator wavers and gets distracted about
illumination, etc., and he sees each one of them-illumination and the
rest-as "This is mine, this is I, this is my self" (M I 135). Hence the
Ancients said:



He wavers about illumination,\
And knowledge, rapturous happiness,\
About the tranquilness, the bliss,\
Whereby his mind becomes confused;\
He wavers about resolution,\
Exertion, and assurance, too,\
The adverting-equanimity,\
And equanimity and attachment (Paṭis II 102).



37\. "'*Equanimity about insight*' is neutrality in the investigation of
formations owing to the objective field having been already
investigated. But in meaning, when it occurs thus, it is only
neutrality. The volition associated with mind-door adverting is called 
'*equanimity* (*upekkhā*) *in adverting*' because it occurs in adverting
as onlooking (*ajjhupekkhana*)" (Vism- mhṭ 819).



[]



[]



[126.] But when illumination, etc., arise, a skilful, wary
meditator who is endowed with discretion either defines and examines it
with understanding thus: "This illumination has arisen.38 But it is
impermanent, formed, conditionally arisen, subject to destruction,
subject to fall, subject to fading away, subject to cessation." Or he
thinks: "If illumination were self, it would be right to take it as
self; but being not-self, it is taken as self. Therefore it is not-self
in the sense of no power being exercisable over it; it is impermanent in
the sense of non-existence after having come to be; it is painful in the
sense of oppression by rise and fall," all of which should be treated in
detail according to the method given under the immaterial septad (§83).
And as in the case of illumination, so too with the rest.



[127.]Having investigated it thus, he sees the illumination as
"This is not mine, this is not I, this is not my self." \[638\] He sees
knowledge ... (etc.) ... attachment as "This is not mine, this is not I,
this is not my self." Seeing thus, he does not waver or vacillate about
the illumination, and so on. Hence the Ancients said:



So when a man of understanding has\
Examined these ten things and is now skilled\
In agitation about higher states\
He no more falls a prey to wavering (Paṭis II 102).



[128.] So he unravels this thirtyfold skein of imperfections
without falling a prey to wavering. He defines what is the path and what
is not the path thus: "The states consisting in illumination, etc., are
not the path; but it is insight knowledge that is free from
imperfections and keeps to its course that is the path."



[129.] The knowledge that is established in him by his coming
to know the path and the not-path thus, "This is the path, this is not
the path," should he understood as the purification by knowledge and
vision of what is the path and what is not the path.



[130.] So at this point the defining of three truths has been
effected by him. How? The defining of the truth of suffering has been
effected with the defining of mentality-materiality in the purification
of view. The defining of the truth of origination has been effected with
the discerning of conditions in the purification by overcoming doubt.
The defining of the truth of the path has been effected with the
emphasizing of the right path in this purification by knowledge and
vision of what is the path and what is not the path. So the defining of
three truths has been effected firstly by means of mundane knowledge
only.

Knowledge and Vision of What Is the Path\
and What is Not the Path" in the Treatise on the\
Development of Understanding in the *Path of Purification* composed for
the purpose of gladdening good people.

PURIFICATION BY KNOWLEDGE AND VISION



OF



THE WAY



(*Paṭipadā-ñāṇadassana-visuddhi-niddesa*)



[1.] \[639\] Now, insight reaches its culmination with the
eight knowledges, and knowledge in conformity with truth1 is ninth;
these are what is called purification by knowledge and vision of the
way.



The eight should be understood as follows: (1) knowledge of
contemplation of rise and fall, which is insight free from imperfections
and steady on its course, (2) knowledge of contemplation of dissolution,
(3) knowledge of appearance as terror, (4) knowledge of contemplation of
danger, (5) knowledge of contemplation of dispassion, (6) knowledge of
desire for deliverance, (7) knowledge of contemplation of reflection,
and (8) knowledge of equanimity about formations.2



"Knowledge in conformity with truth as ninth" is a term for conformity.



So one who wants to perfect this should make these kinds of knowledge
his



task, starting with knowledge of rise and fall free from imperfections.



[2.]But why does he again pursue knowledge of rise and fall? To
observe the \[three\] characteristics. The knowledge of rise and fall
already dealt with, being



1\. "He calls conformity knowledge '*knowledge in conformity with
truth*' because it is suitable for penetrating the truths owing to the
disappearance of the grosser darkness of delusion that conceals the
truths" (Vism-mhṭ 822). The term *saccānulomikañāṇa---*"knowledge in
conformity with truth," occurs at Vibh 315. The term
*anulomañāṇa---*"conformity knowledge," occurs in the Paṭṭhāna (Paṭṭh I
159), but not elsewhere in the Piṭakas apparently.\



2\. "*Knowledge of rise and fall* that has become familiar should be
understood as belonging to full-understanding as abandoning. The
contemplation of only the dissolution of formations is contemplation of
dissolution; that same contemplation as knowledge is *knowledge of
contemplation of dissolution*. One who, owing to it, sees things as they
are is terrified, thus it is terror. The knowledge that seizes the
terrifying aspect of states of the three planes when they appear as
terrifying is *knowledge of appearance as terror*. One desires to be
delivered, thus it is one desiring deliverance: that is, either as a
consciousness or as a person. His (its) state is desire for deliverance.
That itself as *knowledge is knowledge of desire for deliverance*.
Knowledge that occurs in the mode of reflecting again is *knowledge of
contemplation of reflection*. Knowledge that occurs as looking on
(*upekkhanā*) at formations with indifference (*nirapekkhatā*) is
knowledge of equanimity (*upekkhā*) about formations" (Vism-mhṭ
822--23).

disabled by the ten imperfections, was not capable of observing the
three characteristics in their true nature; but once freed from
imperfections, it is able to do so. So he should pursue it again here in
order to observe the characteristics. \[640\]



\[INSIGHT: THE EIGHT KNOWLEDGES\]



\[1. KNOWLEDGE OF RISE AND FALL---II\]



[3.] Now, the characteristics fail to become apparent when
something is not given attention and so something conceals them. What is
that? Firstly, the characteristic of impermanence does not become
apparent because when rise and fall are not given attention, it is
concealed by continuity. The characteristic of pain does not become
apparent because, when continuous oppression is not given attention, it
is concealed by the postures. The characteristic of not-self does not
become apparent because when resolution into the various elements is not
given attention, it is concealed by compactness.



[4.] However, when continuity is disrupted by discerning rise
and fall, the



characteristic of impermanence becomes apparent in its true nature.



When the postures are exposed by attention to continuous oppression, the
characteristic of pain becomes apparent in its true nature. When the
resolution of the compact is effected by resolution into elements, the
characteristic of not- self becomes apparent in its true nature.3



3\. Cf. Peṭ 128. In the commentary to the Āyatana-Vibhaṅga we find:
"Impermanence is obvious, as when a saucer (say) falls and breaks; ...
pain is obvious, as when a boil (say) appears in the body; ... the
characteristic of not-self is not obvious; ... Whether Perfect Ones
arise or do not arise the characteristics of impermanence and pain are
made known, but unless there is the arising of a Buddha the
characteristic of not-self is not made known" (Vibh-a 49--50, abridged
for clarity).\
Again, in the commentary to Majjhima Nikāya Sutta 22: "Having been, it
is not, therefore it is impermanent; it is impermanent for four reasons,
that is, in the sense of the state of rise and fall, of change, of
temporariness, and of denying permanence. It is painful on account of
the mode of oppression; it is painful for four reasons, that is, in the
sense of burning, of being hard to bear, of being the basis for pain,
and of opposing pleasure ... It is not-self on account of the mode of
insusceptibility to the exercise of power; it is not-self for four
reasons, that is, in the sense of voidness, of having no owner-master,
of having no Overlord, and of opposing self (M-a II 113, abridged for
clarity).\
Commenting on this Vism paragraph, Vism-mhṭ says: "'*When continuity is*
*disrupted*' means when continuity is exposed by observing the perpetual
otherness of states as they go on occurring in succession. For it is not
through the connectedness of states that the characteristic of
impermanence becomes apparent to one who rightly observes rise and fall,
but rather the characteristic becomes more thoroughly evident through
their disconnectedness, as if they were iron darts. '*When the postures
are exposed*' means when the concealment of the pain that is actually
inherent in the postures is exposed. For when pain arises in a posture,
the next posture adopted removes the pain, as it were, concealing it.
But once it is correctly known how the pain



[]



[]



[5.]And here the following differences should be understood:
the impermanent, and the characteristic of impermanence; the painful,
and the characteristic of pain; the not-self, and the characteristic of
not-self.



[6.]Herein, the five aggregates are impermanent. Why? Because
they rise and fall and change, or because of their non-existence after
having been. Rise and fall and change are the characteristic of
impermanence; or mode alteration, in other words, non-existence after
having been \[is the characteristic of impermanence\].4



[7.] Those same five aggregates are painful because of the
words, "What is impermanent is painful" (S III 22). Why? Because of
continuous oppression. The mode of being continuously oppressed is the
characteristic of pain.



[8.]Those same five aggregates are not-self because of the
words, "What is painful is not-self" (S III 22). Why? Because there is
no exercising of power over them. The mode of insusceptibility to the
exercise of power is the characteristic of not- self.



[9.]The meditator observes all this in its true nature with the
knowledge of the contemplation of rise and fall, in other words, with
insight free from imperfections and steady on its course.



\[2. KNOWLEDGE OF DISSOLUTION\]



[10.] When he repeatedly observes in this way, and examines and
investigates



material and immaterial states, \[to see\] that they are impermanent,
painful, and



in any posture is shifted by substituting another posture for that one,
then the concealment of the pain that is in them is exposed because it
has become evident that formations are being incessantly overwhelmed by
pain. '*Resolution of the compact*' is effected by resolving \[what
appears compact\] in this way, 'The earth element is one, the water
element is another' etc., distinguishing each one; and in this way,
'Contact is one, feeling is another' etc., distinguishing each one.
'*When the resolution of the compact is effected*' means that what is
compact as a mass and what is compact as a function or as an object has
been analyzed. For when material and immaterial states have arisen
mutually steadying each other, \[mentality and materiality, for
example,\] then, owing to misinterpreting that as a unity, compactness
of mass is assumed through failure to subject formations to pressure.
And likewise compactness of function is assumed when, although definite
differences exist in such and such states' functions, they are taken as
one. And likewise compactness of object is assumed when, although
differences exist in the ways in which states that take objects make
them their objects, those objects are taken as one. But when they are
seen after resolving them by means of knowledge into these elements,
they disintegrate like froth subjected to compression by the hand. They
are mere states (*dhamma*) occurring due to conditions and void. In this
way the characteristic of not-self becomes more evident" (Vism-mhṭ 824).



4\. "These modes, \[that is, the three characteristics,\] are not
included in the aggregates because they are states without individual
essence (*asabhāva-dhammā*); and they are not separate from the
aggregates because they are unapprehendable without the aggregates. But
they should be understood as appropriate conceptual differences
(*paññatti-visesā*) that are reason for differentiation in the
explaining of dangers in the five aggregates, and which are allowable by
common usage in respect of the five aggregates" (Vism-mhṭ 825).

[]



not-self, then if his knowledge works keenly, formations quickly become
apparent.5 Once his knowledge works keenly and formations quickly become
apparent, he no longer extends his mindfulness to their arising or
presence or occurrence or sign, but brings it to bear only on their
cessation as destruction, fall and breakup.6 \[641\]



[11.]When insight knowledge has arisen in him in this way so
that he sees how the field of formations, having arisen thus, ceases
thus, it is called contemplation of dissolution at that stage,7 with
reference to which it is said:



"Understanding of contemplation of dissolution, after reflecting on an
object---



how is this knowledge of insight?



"Consciousness with materiality as its object arises and dissolves.
Having



reflected on that object, he contemplates the dissolution of that
consciousness.



"'He contemplates': how does he contemplate? He contemplates as
impermanent, not as permanent; he contemplates as painful, not as
pleasant; he contemplates as not-self, not as self; he becomes
dispassionate, he does not delight; he causes fading away of greed, he
does not inflame it; he causes cessation, not origination; he
relinquishes, he does not grasp. Contemplating as impermanent, he
abandons the perception of permanence. Contemplating as painful, he
abandons the perception of pleasure. Contemplating as not-self, he
abandons the perception of self. Becoming dispassionate, he abandons
delight. Causing fading away, he abandons greed. Causing cessation, he
abandons originating. Relinquishing, he abandons grasping.



"Consciousness with feeling as its object ... Consciousness with
perception as its object ... with formations as its object ... with
consciousness as its object ... with eye as its object ... (etc.---see
XX.9) ... with ageing-and-death as its object ... Relinquishing, he
abandons grasping.



"The substitution of the object,\
The transference of understanding,\
The power of adverting---these\
Are insight following reflection.



"Defining both to be alike\
By inference from that same object,



5\. "The keenness of knowledge comes about owing to familiarity with
development. And when it is familiar, development occurs as though it
were absorbed in the object owing to the absence of distraction"
(Vism-mhṭ 825).\



6\. "'*Arising*' is the alteration consisting in generation.
'*Presence*' is the arrival at presence: ageing is what is meant.
'*Occurrence*' is the occurrence of what is clung to. '*The sign*' is
the sign of formations; the appearance of formations like graspable
entities, which is due to compactness of mass, etc., and to
individualization of function, is the sign of formations" (Vism-mhṭ
826). See also n.12.\
"It is momentary cessation that is in other words '*cessation as
destruction, fall and* *breakup*'" (Vism-mhṭ 826).\



7\. *Etasmiṃ khaṇe* (or *etasmiṃ ṭhāne*) seems a better reading here
than *ekasmiṃ khaṇe*'; cf. parallel phrases at the end of §29, 30, 31.



[]



[]



Intentness on cessation---these\
Are insight in the mark of fall.



"Having reflected on the object\
Dissolution he contemplates,\
Appearance then as empty---this\
Is insight of higher understanding.



"Skilled in the three contemplations,\
And in the fourfold insight too,\
Skilled in the three appearances,\
The various views will shake him not.



"Knowledge is in the sense of that being known and understanding in the
sense of the act of understanding that. Hence it was said:
'Understanding of contemplating dissolution, after reflecting on an
object, is knowledge of insight'" (Paṭis I 57f).



[12.] Herein,  *after reflecting on an object* is having
reflected on, having known, any object; the meaning is, having seen it
as liable to destruction and fall. *Understanding of the contemplation
of dissolution*: any understanding of the contemplation of the
dissolution of the knowledge arisen after reflecting on the object as
liable to destruction and fall is called *knowledge of insight*. \[642\]
*How* has the meaning of a question showing desire to expound.



[13.]Next, in order to show how that comes about, consciousness
with materiality as its object, etc., is said. Herein, consciousness
with materiality as its object arises and dissolves: *rūpārammaṇaṃ
cittaṃ uppajjitvā bhijjati* \[is the equivalent of\] *rūpārammaṇaṃ
cittaṃ uppajjitvā bhijjati*; or the meaning is *rūpārammaṇabhāve cittaṃ
uppajjitvā bhijjati* \[alternative grammatical substitution\]. *Having
reflected on that object*: having reflected on, having known, that
object consisting of materiality; the meaning is, having seen it as
liable to destruction and fall. *He contemplates the dissolution of that
consciousness*: by means of a subsequent consciousness he contemplates
the dissolution of that consciousness with which that object consisting
of materiality was seen as liable to destruction and fall. Hence the
Ancients said: "He sees with insight both the known and the knowledge."



[14.] *He contemplates*  (*anupassati*): he sees always
accordingly (*anu anu passati*); the meaning is, he sees again and again
in various modes. Hence it is said: "He contemplates": *how does he
contemplate? He contemplates as impermanent*, and so on.



[15.]Herein, dissolution is the culminating point of
impermanence, and so the meditator contemplating dissolution
contemplates the whole field of formations as  *impermanent, not as
permanent*.8 Then, because of the painfulness of what is



8\. "'He contemplates as impermanent' here not by inferential knowledge
thus, "Impermanent in the sense of dissolution", like one who is
comprehending formations by groups (XX.13--14), nor by seeing fall
preceded by apprehension of rise, like a beginner of insight (XX.93ff.);
but rather it is after rise and fall have become apparent as actual
experience through the influence of knowledge of rise and fall that he
then leaves rise aside in the way stated and contemplates formations as
impermanent by seeing only their dissolution. But when he sees them
thus, there is no trace in him of any apprehension of them as permanent"
(Vism-mhṭ 827).



[]



[]



impermanent and because of the non-existence of self in what is painful,
he contemplates that same whole field of formations as *painful, not as
pleasant, he contemplates it as not-self, not as self*.



[16.]But what is impermanent, painful, not-self, is not
something to delight in; and what is not something to delight in is not
something to arouse greed for; consequently, when that field of
formations is seen as impermanent, painful, not-self, in accordance with
the contemplation of dissolution, then *he becomes dispassionate, he
does not delight; he causes fading away of greed, he does not inflame
it*. When he does not inflame greed thus, *he causes cessation* of
greed, not its *origination*, which happens firstly by means of mundane
knowledge;9 the meaning is, he does not cause origination.



[17.]Or alternatively, having thus caused the fading away of
greed, and caused the cessation of the seen field of formations, he
causes the cessation of the unseen too by means of inferential
knowledge, he does not originate it. He gives attention only to its
cessation, he sees only its cessation, not its origin, is the meaning.



[18.] Progressing in this way, *he relinquishes, he does not
grasp*. What is meant? \[What is meant is that\] this contemplation of
impermanence, etc., is also called both "relinquishment as giving up"
and "relinquishment as entering into" (see Paṭis I 194) because, by
substitution of opposite qualities, it gives up defilements along with
aggregate producing kamma-formations, and because, by seeing the
unsatisfactoriness of what is formed, \[643\] it also enters into, by
inclining towards, Nibbāna, which is the opposite of the formed.
Therefore the bhikkhu who possesses that \[contemplation\] gives up
defilements and enters into Nibbāna in the way stated, he does not grasp
(cling to) defilements by causing rebirth, nor does he grasp (cling to)
a formed object through failing to see its unsatisfactoriness. Hence it
was said: *he relinquishes, he does not grasp*.



[19.]Now, in order to show which states are abandoned by these
three kinds of knowledge, *contemplating as impermanent*, *he abandons
the perception of permanence*, etc., is said. Herein, delight is craving
accompanied by happiness. The rest is as already stated.



[20.]As to the stanzas: *the substitution of the object*
\[means that\] after seeing the dissolution of materiality, there is the
substitution of another object for that first object by seeing the
dissolution of the consciousness by which the dissolution \[of
materiality\] was seen. *Transference of understanding* is the
abandoning of rise and the specializing in fall. *The power of
adverting* is the ability, after seeing the dissolution of materiality,
to advert immediately for the purpose of seeing the dissolution of the
consciousness that had that dissolution as its object. *Are insight
following reflection*: this is called contemplation of dissolution after
reflecting on an object.



[21.]*Defining both to be alike by inference* *from that same
object*: the meaning is that by inference, by induction, from the object
seen by actual experience he defines



9\. "'*Causes cessation*': he causes greed to reach the cessation of
suppression; he suppresses it, is the meaning. That is why he said '*by
means of mundane knowledge*.' And since there is suppression, how can
there be arousing? Therefore he said '*not its origination*'" (Vism-mhṭ
828).



[]



[]



both \[the seen and the unseen\] to have a single individual essence
thus, "The field of formations dissolved in the past, and will break up
in the future, just as it does \[in the present\]." And this is said by
the Ancients:



"With vision of those present purified\
He infers those past and future to be alike;\
He infers that all formations disappear,\
Like dew-drops when the morning sun comes up."



[22.]*Intentness on cessation*: after thus giving to both a
single definition based on their dissolution, he thus becomes intent on
cessation, in other words, on that same dissolution. The meaning is that
he attaches importance to it, inclines, tends, leans towards it. *Are
insight in the mark of fall*: what is meant is that this is called
insight into the characteristic of fall.



[23.] *Having reflected on the object*: having first known the
object consisting of materiality, and so on. *Dissolution he
contemplates*: having seen the dissolution of that object, he
contemplates the dissolution of the consciousness that had that as its
object. \[644\]



[24.]*Appearance then as empty*: while he is contemplating
dissolution in this way, he succeeds in making \[formations\] appear as
void thus, "Only formations breakup; their breakup is death; there is
nothing else at all10." Hence the Ancients said:



"Aggregates cease and nothing else exists;\
Breakup of aggregates is known as death.\
He watches their destruction steadfastly,\
As one who with a diamond drills a gem." 11



[25.]*Is insight of higher understanding*: what is meant is
that the reflection on the object, the contemplation of dissolution, and
the appearance as void are called insight of higher understanding.



[26.]*Skilled in the three contemplations*: a bhikkhu who is
competent in the three beginning with contemplation of impermanence.
*And in the fourfold insight too*: in the four kinds of insight
beginning with dispassion. *Skilled in the three appearances*: and owing
to skill in this threefold appearance, namely, as liable to destruction
and fall, as terror, and as void.12 *The various views will shake him
not*: he does not vacillate on account of the various kinds of views
such as the eternity view.



10\. "Here in this world there is no self that is something other than
and apart from the aggregates" (Vism-mhṭ 830). Cf. also: "When any
ascetics or brahmans whatever see self in its various forms, they all of
them see the five aggregates, or one of them" (S IV 46).



11\. "As a skilled man drilling a gem with a tool watches and keeps in
mind only the hole he is drilling, not the gem's colour, etc., so too
the meditator wisely keeps in mind only the ceaseless dissolution of
formations, not the formations" (Vism-mhṭ 830).



12\. The Harvard text reads "*khayato vayato suññato ti---*as
destruction, as fall, as void." But Vism-mhṭ says: "'*The three
appearances'*: in the threefold appearance as impermanent and so on. For
appearance as destruction and fall is appearance as impermanent,
appearance as terror is appearance as pain, and appearance as void is
appearance as not-self (Vism-mhṭ 830).



[]



[]



[27.] When he no longer vacillates and so constantly bears in
mind that the unceased will also cease, the undissolved will also
dissolve, then he disregards the arising, presence, occurrence and sign
of all formations, which keep on breaking up, like fragile pottery being
smashed, like fine dust being dispersed, like sesame seeds being
roasted, and he sees only their breakup. Just as a man with eyes
standing on the bank of a pond or on the bank of a river during heavy
rain would see large bubbles appearing on the surface of the water and
breaking up as soon as they appeared, so too he sees how formations
break up all the time. The Blessed One said of such a meditator:



"And he who looks upon the world\
As one who looks upon a bubble,\
As one who looks upon a mirage,\
Is out of sight of Death the King" (Dhp 170).



[28.]When he constantly sees that all formations thus break up
all the time, then contemplation of dissolution grows strong in him,
bringing eight advantages, which are these: abandoning of \[false\] view
of becoming, giving up attachment to life, constant application, a
purified livelihood, no more anxiety, absence of fear, acquisition of
patience and gentleness, and conquest of aversion (boredom) and sensual
delight. \[645\] Hence the Ancients said:



"On seeing these eight perfect qualities\
He comprehends formations constantly,\
Seeing breakup in order to attain\
The Deathless, like the sage with burning turban."\
(see S V 440)



Knowledge of contemplation of dissolution is ended.



\[3. KNOWLEDGE OF APPEARANCE AS TERROR\]



[29.] As he repeats, develops and cultivates in this way the
contemplation of dissolution, the object of which is cessation
consisting in the destruction, fall and breakup of all formations, then
formations classed according to all kinds of becoming, generation,
destiny, station, or abode of beings, appear to him in the form of a
great terror, as lions, tigers, leopards, bears, hyenas, spirits, ogres,
fierce bulls, savage dogs, rut-maddened wild elephants, hideous venomous
serpents, thunderbolts, charnel grounds, battlefields, flaming coal
pits, etc., appear to a timid man who wants to live in peace. When he
sees how past formations have ceased, present ones are ceasing, and
those to be generated in the future will cease in just the same way,
then what is called knowledge of appearance as terror arises in him at
that stage.



[30.] *Here is a simile*: a woman's three sons had offended
against the king, it seems. The king ordered their heads to be cut off.
She went with her sons to the place of their execution. When they had
cut off the eldest one's head, they set about cutting off the middle
one's head. Seeing the eldest one's head already cut off and the middle
one's head being cut off, she gave up hope for the youngest, thinking,
"He too will fare like them." Now, the meditator's seeing the cessation
of past formations is like the woman's seeing the eldest son's head cut
off. His



[]



[]



seeing the cessation of those present is like her seeing the middle
one's head being cut off. His seeing the cessation of those in the
future, thinking, "Formations to be generated in the future will cease
too," is like her giving up hope for the youngest son, thinking, "He too
will fare like them." When he sees in this way, knowledge of appearance
as terror arises in him at that stage.



[31.]Also another simile: a woman with an infected womb had, it
seems, given birth to ten children. \[646\] Of these, nine had already
died and one was dying in her hands. There was another in her womb.
Seeing that nine were dead and the tenth was dying, she gave up hope
about the one in her womb, thinking, "It too will fare just like them."
Herein, the meditator's seeing the cessation of past formations is like
the woman's remembering the death of the nine children. The meditator's
seeing the cessation of those present is like her seeing the moribund
state of the one in her hands. His seeing the cessation of those in the
future is like her giving up hope about the one in her womb. When he
sees in this way, knowledge of appearance as terror arises in him at
that stage.



[32.]But does the knowledge of appearance as terror \[itself\]
fear or does it not fear? It does not fear. For it is simply the mere
judgment that past formations have ceased, present ones are ceasing, and
future ones will cease. Just as a man with eyes looking at three
charcoal pits at a city gate is not himself afraid, since he only forms
the mere judgment that all who fall into them will suffer no little
pain;---or just as when a man with eyes looks at three spikes set in a
row, an acacia spike, an iron spike, and a gold spike, he is not himself
afraid, since he only forms the mere judgment that all who fall on these
spikes will suffer no little pain;---so too the knowledge of appearance
as terror does not itself fear; it only forms the mere judgment that in
the three kinds of becoming, which resemble the three charcoal pits and
the three spikes, past formations have ceased, present ones are ceasing,
and future ones will cease.



[33.]But it is called "appearance as terror" only because
formations in all kinds of becoming, generation, destiny, station, or
abode are fearful in being bound for destruction and so they appear only
as a terror.



Here is the text about its appearance to him as terror: "When he brings
to mind as impermanent, what appears to him as terror? When he brings to
mind as painful, what appears to him as terror? When he brings to mind
as not-self, what appears to him as terror? When he brings to mind as
impermanent, the sign appears to him as terror. When he brings to mind
as painful, occurrence appears to him as terror. When he brings to mind
as not-self, the sign and occurrence appear to him as terror" (Paṭis II
63).



[34.] Herein, *the sign* is the sign of formations. This is a
term for past, future and present formations themselves. \[647\] He sees
only the death of formations when he brings them to mind as impermanent
and so the sign appears to him as a terror.  *Occurrence* is occurrence
in material and immaterial becoming. He sees occurrence---though
ordinarily reckoned as pleasure---only as a state of being continuously
oppressed when he brings them to mind as painful, and so occurrence
appears to him as a terror.



[]



[]



He sees both the sign and the occurrence as empty, vain, void, without
power or guide, like an empty village, a mirage, a goblin city, etc.,
when he brings \[them\] to mind as not-self, and so the sign and
occurrence appear to him as a terror.



Knowledge of appearance as terror is ended.



\[4. KNOWLEDGE OF DANGER\]



[35.] As he repeats, develops and cultivates the knowledge of
appearance as terror he finds no asylum, no shelter, no place to go to,
no refuge in any kind of becoming, generation, destiny, station, or
abode. In all the kinds of becoming, generation, destiny, station, and
abode there is not a single formation that he can place his hopes in or
hold on to. The three kinds of becoming appear like charcoal pits full
of glowing coals, the four primary elements like hideous venomous snakes
(S IV 174), the five aggregates like murderers with raised weapons (S IV
174), the six internal bases like an empty village, the six external
bases like village-raiding robbers (S IV 174--75), the seven stations of
consciousness and the nine abodes of beings as though burning, blazing
and glowing with the eleven fires (see S IV 19), and all formations
appear as a huge mass of dangers destitute of satisfaction or substance,
like a tumour, a disease, a dart, a calamity, an affliction (see M I
436). How?



[36.]They appear as a forest thicket of seemingly pleasant
aspect but infested with wild beasts, a cave full of tigers, water
haunted by monsters and ogres, an enemy with raised sword, poisoned
food, a road beset by robbers, a burning coal, a battlefield between
contending armies appear to a timid man who wants to live in peace. And
just as that man is frightened and horrified and his hair stands up when
he comes upon a thicket infested by wild beasts, etc., and he sees it as
nothing but danger, so too when all formations have appeared as a terror
by contemplation of dissolution, this meditator sees them as utterly
destitute of any core or any satisfaction and as nothing but danger.



[37.] "How is it that understanding of appearance as terror is
knowledge of danger? \[648\]



"(1.a.) Understanding of appearance as terror thus, 'Arising is terror,'
is knowledge of danger. Understanding of appearance as terror thus,
'Occurrence is terror' ... 'The sign is terror' ... 'Accumulation is
terror' ... 'Rebirth-linking is terror' ... 'Destiny is terror' ...

... 'Ageing is terror' ... 'Sickness is terror' ... 'Death is terror'
... 'Sorrow is terror' ... Understanding of appearance as terror thus,
'Lamentation is terror,' is knowledge of danger. Understanding of
appearance as terror thus, 'Despair is terror,' is knowledge of danger.



"(1.b.) Knowledge of the state of peace is this: 'Non-arising is
safety.' Knowledge of the state of peace is this: 'Non-occurrence is
safety' ... (etc.) ... Knowledge of the state of peace is this:

And no occurrence, and no sign,\

"This knowledge about danger has\

Ten knowledges he understands.



[]



[]



"When skilled in these two kinds of knowledge\
The various views will shake him not.



"Knowledge is in the sense of that being known and understanding is in
the sense of the act of understanding that. Hence it was said:
'Understanding of appearance as terror is knowledge of danger'" (Paṭis I
59f).



[38.]Herein, arising is appearance here \[in this becoming\]
with previous kamma as condition. *Occurrence* is the occurrence of what
has arisen in this way. *The sign* is the sign of all formations.
*Accumulation* is the kamma that is the cause of future rebirth-linking.
Rebirth-linking is future appearance. *Destiny* is the destiny in which
the rebirth-linking takes place. *Generation* is the generating of
aggregates. *Re-arising* is the occurrence of kamma-result stated thus,
"In one who has attained \[to it\] or in one who has been reborn \[in
it\]" (Dhs §1282). *Birth* is birth with becoming as its condition,
itself a condition for ageing and so on. Ageing, sickness, death, etc.,
are obvious.



[39.] And here only the five beginning with arising are
mentioned as actual objects of knowledge of danger; the rest are
synonyms for them. For the pair, *generation* and *birth*, are synonyms
both for *arising* and for *rebirth-linking*. The pair, *destiny* and
*re-arising*, are synonyms for *occurrence*. *Ageing*, etc., are
synonyms for the sign. Hence it was said:



"He contemplates as suffering\
Arising, occurrence, and the sign,\
Accumulation, rebirth-linking---\
And this his knowledge is of danger."



And:



"This knowledge about danger has\
Five sources for its origin" (§37).



[40.]*Knowledge of the state of peace is this*: "*Non-arising
is safety*," etc.: this, however, should be understood as said for the
purpose of showing the opposite kind of knowledge to knowledge of
danger. Or when it is stated in this way, that there is safety without
terror and free from danger, it is for the purpose of comforting those
who are upset in their hearts by seeing danger through appearance as
terror. Or else, when arising, etc., have clearly appeared to a man as
terror, his mind inclines towards their opposites, and so this is said
\[650\] for the purpose of showing the advantages in the knowledge of
danger established by the appearance as terror.



41\.



And here (1.a.) what is terror is certainly (2.a) *suffering*, and what
is suffering is purely (3.a.) worldly since it is not free from the
worldliness of the rounds \[of becoming\], of the world, and of
defilements,13 and what is worldly consists solely



13\. Vism-mhṭ defines the three kinds of worldliness (*āmisa*) as
follows: *Worldliness of the round* (*vaṭṭāmisa*) is that of the
threefold round of past, future and present becoming; worldliness of the
world (*lokāmisa*) is the five cords of sense desire (i.e. objects of
sense desire including food, etc.) because they are accessible to
defilements; *worldliness of defilement* (*kilesāmisa*) is the
defilements themselves (see Vism-mhṭ 836).



[]



[]



of (4.a) *formations*. Therefore it is said that (2.a) *understanding of
appearance as terror thus*, "Arising is suffering," is knowledge of
danger, and so on. And while this is so, still there is a difference to
be understood here in the way these things \[beginning with "arising"\]
occur, since there is a difference in their mode with the mode of
terror, the mode of suffering, and the mode of worldliness.



[42.]*Ten knowledges he understands*: one who understands
knowledge of danger understands, penetrates, realizes, ten kinds of
knowledge, that is, the five based on arising, etc., and the five on
non-arising and so on. *When skilled in these two kinds of knowledge*:
with skill in the two, that is, knowledge of danger and knowledge of the
state of peace. *The various views will shake him not*: he does not
vacillate about views that occur such as "The ultimate Nibbāna is here
and now." The rest is clear.



Knowledge of contemplation of danger is ended.



\[5. KNOWLEDGE OF DISPASSION\]



[43.] When he sees all formations in this way as danger, he
becomes dispassionate towards, is dissatisfied with, takes no delight in
the manifold field of formations belonging to any kind of becoming,
destiny, station of consciousness, or abode of beings. Just as a golden
swan that loves the foothills of Citta Peak finds delight, not in a
filthy puddle at the gate of a village of outcastes, but only in the
seven great lakes (see XIII.38), so too this meditator swan finds
delight, not in the manifold formations seen clearly as danger, but only
in the seven contemplations, because he delights in development. And
just as the lion, king of beasts, finds delight, not when put into a
gold cage, but only in Himalaya with its three thousand leagues' extent,
so too the meditator lion finds delight, not in the triple becoming of
the happy destiny,14 but only in the three contemplations. And just as
Chaddanta, king of elephants, all white with sevenfold stance, possessed
of supernormal power, who travels through the air,15 finds pleasure, not
in the midst of a town, but only in the Chaddanta Lake and Wood in the
Himalaya, \[651\] so too this meditator elephant finds delight, not in
any formation, but only in the state of peace seen in the way beginning
"Non-arising is safety," and his mind tends, inclines, and leans towards
that.



Knowledge of contemplation of dispassion is ended.



[44.]\[Knowledge of contemplation of danger\] is the same as
the last two kinds of knowledge in meaning. Hence the Ancients said:
"Knowledge of appearance as terror while one only has three names: It
saw all formations as terror, thus the name 'appearance as terror'
arose; it aroused the \[appearance of\] danger in those same formations,
thus the name 'contemplation of danger' arose; it arose,



14\. The reference is to the happy destinies of the sense-desire world
(human beings and deities), the fine-material Brahmā-world, and the
immaterial Brahmā-world.



15\. For "ten kinds of elephants" of which the Chaddanta (Six-toothed)
is the "best" see M-a II 25. Cf. also the description of the elephant
called "Uposatha," one of the seven treasures of the Wheel-turning
Monarch (M II 173). On the expression "with sevenfold stance"
(*sattappatiṭṭha*) Vism-mhṭ says "*Hatthapāda-vālavatthikosehi
bhūmiphusanehi sattahi patiṭṭhito ti sattapatiṭṭho*" (Vism-mhṭ 838).



[]



[]



becoming dispassionate towards those same formations, thus the name
'contemplation of dispassion' arose." Also it is said in the text:
"Understanding of appearance as terror, knowledge of danger, and
dispassion: these things are one in meaning, only the letter is
different" (Paṭis II 63).



\[6. KNOWLEDGE OF DESIRE FOR DELIVERANCE\]



[45.] When, owing to this knowledge of dispassion, this
clansman becomes dispassionate towards, is dissatisfied with, takes no
delight in any single one of all the manifold formations in any kind of
becoming, generation, destiny, station of consciousness, or abode of
beings, his mind no longer sticks fast, cleaves, fastens on to them, and
he becomes desirous of being delivered from the whole field of
formations and escaping from it. Like what?



[46.]Just as a fish in a net, a frog in a snake's jaws, a
jungle fowl shut into a cage, a deer fallen into the clutches of a
strong snare, a snake in the hands of a snake charmer, an elephant stuck
fast in a great bog, a royal nāga in the mouth of a supaṇṇa, the moon
inside Rāhu's mouth,16 a man encircled by enemies, etc.--- just as these
are desirous of being delivered, of finding an escape from these things,
so too this meditator's mind is desirous of being delivered from the
whole field of formations and escaping from it. Then, when he thus no
longer relies on any formations and is desirous of being delivered from
the whole field of formations, knowledge of desire for deliverance
arises in him.



Knowledge of desire for deliverance is ended.



\[7. KNOWLEDGE OF REFLECTION\]



[47.]Being thus desirous of deliverance from all the manifold
formations in any kind of becoming, generation, destiny, station, or
abode, in order to be delivered from the whole field of formations
\[652\] he again discerns those same formations, attributing to them the
three characteristics by knowledge of contemplation of reflection.



[48.]He sees all formations as impermanent for the following
reasons: because they are non-continuous, temporary, limited by rise and
fall, disintegrating, fickle, perishable, unenduring, subject to change,
coreless, due to be annihilated, formed, subject to death, and so on.



He sees them as painful for the following reasons: because they are
continuously oppressed, hard to bear, the basis of pain, a disease, a
tumour, a dart, a calamity, an affliction, a plague, a disaster, a
terror, a menace, no protection, no shelter, no refuge, a danger, the
root of calamity, murderous, subject to cankers, Māra's bait, subject to
birth, subject to ageing, subject to illness, subject to sorrow, subject
to lamentation, subject to despair, subject to defilement, and so on.



He sees all formations as foul (ugly)---the ancillary characteristic to
that of pain---for the following reasons: because they are
objectionable, stinking, disgusting, repulsive, unaffected by disguise,
hideous, loathsome, and so on.



16\. Rāhu is the name for the eclipse of the sun or moon, personalized
as a demon who takes them in his mouth (see S I 50--51 and M I 87).



[]



[]



He sees all formations as not-self for the following reasons: because
they are alien, empty, vain, void, ownerless, with no Overlord, with
none to wield power over them, and so on.



It is when he sees formations in this way that he is said to discern
them by



attributing to them the three characteristics.



[49.]But why does he discern them in this way? In order to
contrive the means to deliverance. Here is a simile: a man thought to
catch a fish, it seems, so he took a fishing net and cast it in the
water. He put his hand into the mouth of the net under the water and
seized a snake by the neck. He was glad, thinking, "I have caught a
fish." In the belief that he had caught a big fish, he lifted it up to
see. When he saw three marks, he perceived that it was a snake and he
was terrified. He saw danger, felt dispassion (revulsion) for what he
had seized, and desired to be delivered from it. Contriving a means to
deliverance, he unwrapped \[the coils from\] his hand, starting from the
tip of its tail. Then he raised his arm, and when he had weakened the
snake by swinging it two or three times round his head, he flung it
away, crying "Go, foul snake." Then quickly scrambling up on to dry
land, he stood looking back whence he had come, thinking, "Goodness, I
have been delivered from the jaws of a huge snake!"



[50.]Herein, the time when the meditator was glad at the outset
to have acquired a person is like the time when the man was glad to have
seized the snake by the neck. This meditator's seeing the three
characteristics in formations after effecting resolution of the compact
\[into elements\] is like the man's seeing the three marks on pulling
the snake's head out of the mouth of the net. \[653\] The meditator's
knowledge of appearance as terror is like the time when the man was
frightened. Knowledge of contemplation of danger is like the man's
thereupon seeing the danger. Knowledge of contemplation of dispassion is
like the man's dispassion (revulsion) for what he had seized. Knowledge
of desire for deliverance is like the man's deliverance from the snake.
The attribution of the three characteristics to formations by knowledge
of contemplation of reflection is like the man's contriving a means to
deliverance. For just as the man weakened the snake by swinging it,
keeping it away and rendering it incapable of biting, and was thus quite
delivered, so too this meditator weakens formations by swinging them
with the attribution of the three characteristics, rendering them
incapable of appearing again in the modes of permanence, pleasure,
beauty, and self, and is thus quite delivered. That is why it was said
above that he discerns them in this way "in order to contrive the means
to deliverance."



[51.]At this point knowledge of reflection has arisen in him,
with reference to which it is said: "When he brings to mind as
impermanent, there arises in him knowledge after reflecting on what?
When he brings to mind as painful, ... as not-self, there arises in him
knowledge after reflecting on what? When he brings to mind as
impermanent, there arises in him knowledge after reflecting on the sign.
When he brings to mind as painful, there arises in him knowledge after
reflecting on occurrence. When he brings to mind as not-self, there
arises in him knowledge after reflecting on the sign and occurrence"
(Paṭis II 63).



[]



[]



[52.] As here *after reflecting on the sign* \[means\] having
known the sign of formations by means of the characteristic of
impermanence as unlasting and temporary. Of course, it is not17 that,
first having known, subsequently knowledge arises; but it is expressed
in this way according to common usage, as in the passage beginning, "Due
to (lit. having depended upon) mind and mental object,
mind-consciousness arises" (M I 112), and so on. Or alternatively, it
can be understood as expressed thus according to the method of identity
by identifying the preceding with the subsequent. The meaning of the
remaining two expressions \[that is, "occurrence" and "the sign and
occurrence"\] should be understood in the same way.



Knowledge of contemplation of reflection is ended.



\[DISCERNING FORMATIONS AS VOID\]



[53.] Having thus discerned by knowledge of contemplation of
reflection that "All formations are void" (see S III 167), he again
discerns voidness in the double logical relation18 thus: "This is void
of self or of what belongs to self" (M II 263; Paṭis II 36).



When he has thus seen that there is neither a self nor any other \[thing
or being\] occupying the position of a self s property, he again
discerns voidness in the quadruple logical relation as set forth in this
\[654\] passage: "I am not anywhere anyone's owning, nor is there
anywhere my owning in anyone (*nāhaṃ kvacani kassaci kiñcanat' asmiṃ na
ca mama kvacani kismiñci kiñcanat' atthi*)" (M II 263).19 How?



17\. The sense seems to require a reading, "*Kāmañ ca na paṭhamaṃ*"...



18\. *Dvikoṭika* ("double logical relation") and *catukoṭika*
("quadruple logical relation"): Skr. *catuýkoṭi* (cf. Th. Stcherbatsky,
*Buddhist Logi*c, pp. 60--61, note 5).



19\. There are a number of variant readings to this sutta passage (which
is met with elsewhere as follows: A I 206; II 177; cf. III 170). There
are also variant readings of the commentary, reproduced at M-a IV 63--65
and in the commentary to A II 177. The readings adopted are those which
a study of the various contexts has indicated. The passage is a
difficult one.\
The sutta passage seems from its various settings to have been a phrase
current among non-Buddhists, as a sort of slogan for naked ascetics (A I
206); and it is used to describe the base consisting of nothingness (M
II 263), in which latter sense it is incorporated in the Buddha's
teaching as a description that can be made the basis for right view or
wrong view according as it is treated.\
The commentarial interpretation given here is summed up by Vism-mhṭ as
follows: "'*Nāhaṃ kvacini*': he sees the non-existence of a self of his
own. '*Na kassaci kiñcanat'asmiṃ*': he sees of his own self too that it
is not the property of another's self. '*Na ca mama*': these words
should be construed as indicated. '*Atthi*' applies to each clause. He
sees the nonexistence of another's self thus, 'There is no other's self
anywhere.' He sees of another that that other is not the property of his
own self thus, 'My owning of that other's self does not exist.' So this
mere conglomeration of formations is seen, by discerning it with the
voidness of the quadruple logical relation, as voidness of self or
property of a self in both internal and external aggregates'" (Vism-mhṭ
840--41 = *ṭīkā\
*to MN 106).



[]



[]



[54.](i) This \[meditator, thinking\] I ... not anywhere
(*nāhaṃ kvacani*), does not see a self anywhere; (ii) \[Thinking\] am
... anyone's owning (*kassaci kiñcanat' asmiṃ*), he does not see a self
of his own to be inferred in another's owning; the meaning is that he
does not see \[a self of his own\] deducible by conceiving a brother
\[to own it\] in the case of a brother,20 a friend \[to own it\] in the
case of a friend, or a chattel \[to own it\] in the case of a chattel;
(iii) \[As regards the phrase\] nor ... anywhere my (*na ca mama
kvacani*), leaving aside the word my (*mama*) here for the moment, \[the
words\] nor anywhere (*na ca kvacani*) \[means that\] he does not21 see
another's self anywhere; (iv) Now, bringing in the word my (*mama*),
\[we have\] is there ... my owning in anyone (*mama kismiñci kiñcanat'
atthi*): he does not see thus, "Another's self exists owing to some
state of my owning22 \[of it\]"; the meaning is that he does not see in
any instance another's self deducible owing to this fact of his owning a
brother in the case of a brother, a friend in the case of a friend,
chattel in the case of a chattel. So (i) he sees no self anywhere \[of
his own\]; (ii) nor does he see it as deducible in the fact of another's
owning; (iii) nor does he see another's self; (iv) nor does he see that
as deducible in the fact of his own owning.23 This is how he discerns
voidness in the quadruple logical relation.



[55.] Having discerned voidness in the quadruple logical
relation in this way, he discerns voidness again in six modes. How? Eye
(i) is void of self, (ii) or of the property of a self, (iii) or of
permanence, (iv) or of lastingness, (v) or of eternalness, (vi) or of
non-subjectness to change; ... mind ... visible data ... mental data ...
eye-consciousness ... mind-consciousness ... mind-contact ... (Nidd II
187 (Se); Nidd II 279 (Ee); cf. S IV 54) and this should be continued as
far as ageing-and- death (see XX.9).



[56.] Having discerned voidness in the six modes in this way,
he discerns it again in eight modes, that is to say: "Materiality has no
core, is coreless, without core, as far as concerns (i) any core of
permanence, or (ii) core of lastingness, or (iii) core of pleasure, or
(iv) core of self, or as far as concerns (v) what is permanent, or (vi)
what is lasting, or (vii) what is eternal, or (viii) what is not subject
to change. Feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness ...
eye ... (etc., see XX.9) ... ageing-and-death has no core, is coreless,
without a core, as far as concerns any core of permanence, or core of
lastingness, or core of pleasure, or core of self, or as far as concerns
what is permanent, or what is lasting, or what is eternal, or what is
not subject to change. Just as a reed has no core, is coreless, without
core; just as a castor-oil plant, an *udumbara* (fig) tree, a
*setavaccha* tree, a *pāḷibhaddaka* tree, a lump of froth, a bubble on
water, a mirage, a plantain trunk, \[655\] a conjuring trick, has no
core, is coreless, without core, so too materiality ...



20\. *Bhātiṭṭhāne---*"in the case of a brother": the form *bhāti* is not
given in PED.



21\. Reading "... *ṭhapetvā na ca kvacini* (:) *parassa ca attānaṃ kvaci
na passatī ti ayaṃ attho*; *idāni* ..." with Ce of M-a and A-a\



22\. M-a Sinhalese (Aluvihāra) ed. has *kiñcanabhāvena* here instead of
*kiñcana*-*bhāve*.



23\. Sinhalese eds. of M-a and A-a both read here: "... *upanetabbaṃ
passati, na parassa attānaṃ passati, na parassa attano kiñcanabhāve
upanetabbaṃ passati*," which the sense demands.



[]



[]



(etc) ... ageing-and-death has no core ... or what is subject to change"
(Nidd II 184--85 (Se); Nidd II 278--89 (Ee)).



[57.]Having discerned voidness in eight modes in this way, he
discerns it again in ten modes. How? "He sees materiality as empty, as
vain, as not-self, as having no Overlord, as incapable of being made
into what one wants, as incapable of being had \[as one wishes\], as
insusceptible to the exercise of mastery, as alien, as secluded \[from
past and future\]. He sees feeling ... (etc.) ... consciousness as
empty, ... as secluded"24 (Nidd II 279 (Ee)).



[58.]Having discerned voidness in ten modes in this way, he
discerns it again in twelve modes, that is to say: "Materiality is no
living being,25 no soul, no human being, no man, no female, no male, no
self, no property of a self, not I, not mine, not another's, not
anyone's. Feeling ... (etc.) ... consciousness ... not anyone's (Nidd II
186 (Se); Nidd II 280 (Ee)).



[59.] Having discerned voidness in twelve modes in this way, he
discerns it again in forty-two modes through full-understanding as
investigating. He sees materiality as impermanent, as painful, as a
disease, a tumour, a dart, a calamity, an affliction, as alien, as
disintegrating, a plague, a disaster, a terror, a menace, as fickle,
perishable, unenduring, as no protection, no shelter, no refuge, as
unfit to be a refuge, as empty, vain, void, not-self, as without
satisfaction,26 as a danger, as subject to change, as having no core, as
the root of calamity, as murderous, as due to be annihilated, as subject
to cankers, as formed, as Māra's bait, as subject to birth, subject to
ageing, subject to illness, subject to death, subject to sorrow,
lamentation, pain, grief and despair; as arising, as departing; as
danger,27 as (having an) escape. He sees feeling ... (etc.) ...
consciousness ... as (having an) escape (cf. Paṭis II 238).



[60.] And this is said too:28 "When he sees materiality as
impermanent ... as (having an) escape, he looks upon the world as void.
When he sees feeling ... (etc.) ... consciousness as impermanent ... as
(having an) escape, he looks upon the world as void." \[656\]



"Let him look on the world as void:\
Thus, Mogharāja, always mindful,\
He may escape the clutch of death



24\. The cause and the fruit being secluded from each other (see
Vism-mhṭ 842).



25\. "A meaning such as 'what in common usage in the world is called a
being is not materiality' is not intended here because it is not implied
by what is said; for the common usage of the world does not speak of
mere materiality as a being. What is intended as a being is the self
that is conjectured by outsiders" (Vism-mhṭ 842).



26\. "This is not in the text. If it were there would be forty-three
ways" (Vism-mhṭ 842).



27\. "Although it has already been described as a danger in order to
show it as such, the word is used again in order to show that it is
opposed to enjoyment (satisfaction)" (Vism-mhṭ 843).\



28\. Vism-mhṭ (p. 843) seems to suggest that this is quoted from the
Niddesa, but it is not in Nidd II in this form. Cf. Nidd II 162 (Be):
*Atha vā, vedanaṃ aniccato ... dukkhato rogato gaṇḍato sallato aghato
ābādhato ... pe ... nissaraṇato passanto vedanaṃ nābhinandati ...*

\[8. KNOWLEDGE OF EQUANIMITY ABOUT FORMATIONS\]



[61.]When he has discerned formations by attributing the three
characteristics to them and seeing them as void in this way, he abandons
both terror and delight, he becomes indifferent to them and neutral, he
neither takes them as "I" nor as mine," he is like a man who has
divorced his wife.



[62.]Suppose a man were married to a lovely, desirable,
charming wife and so deeply in love with her as to be unable to bear
separation from her for a moment. He would be disturbed and displeased
to see her standing or sitting or talking or laughing with another man,
and would be very unhappy; but later, when he had found out the woman's
faults, and wanting to get free, had divorced her, he would no more take
her as "mine"; and thereafter, even though he saw her doing whatever it
might be with whomsoever it might be, he would not be disturbed or
displeased, but would on the contrary be indifferent and neutral. So too
this \[meditator\], wanting to get free from all formations, discerns
formations by the contemplation of reflection; then, seeing nothing to
be taken as "I" or "mine," he abandons both terror and delight and
becomes indifferent and neutral towards all formations.



[63.]When he knows and sees thus, his heart retreats, retracts
and recoils from the three kinds of becoming, the four kinds of
generation, the five kinds of destiny, the seven stations of
consciousness, and the nine abodes of beings; his heart no longer goes
out to them. Either equanimity or repulsiveness is established. Just as
water drops retreat, retract and recoil on a lotus leaf that slopes a
little and do not spread out, so too his heart ... And just as a fowl's
feather or a shred of sinew thrown on a fire retreats, retracts and
recoils, and does not spread out, so too his heart retreats, retracts
and recoils from the three kinds of becoming ... Either equanimity or
repulsiveness is established.



In this way there arises in him what is called knowledge of equanimity
about



formations.



[64.] But if this \[knowledge\] sees Nibbāna, the state of
peace, as peaceful, it rejects the occurrence of all formations and
enters only into Nibbāna. If it does not see Nibbāna as peaceful,
\[657\] it occurs again and again with formations as its object, like
the sailors' crow.



[65.]When traders board a ship, it seems, they take with them
what is called a land-finding crow. When the ship gets blown off its
course by gales and goes adrift with no land in sight, then they release
the land-finding crow. It takes off from the mast-head,30 and after
exploring all the quarters, if it sees land, it flies straight in the
direction of it; if not, it returns and alights on the mast-head. So



29\. Sn 1119: Nidd II 190 (Se); Nidd II 278 (Ee)\



30\. *Kūpaka-yaṭṭhi---*"mast-head" (?): the word *kūpaka* appears in
PED, only as an equivalent for *kūpa* = a hole. Cf. D I 222 for this
simile.



[]

too, if knowledge of equanimity about formations sees Nibbāna, the state
of peace, as peaceful, it rejects the occurrence of all formations and
enters only into Nibbāna. If it does not see it, it occurs again and
again with formations as its object.



[66.] Now, after discerning formations in the various modes, as
though sifting flour on the edge of a tray, as though carding cotton
from which the seeds have been picked out,31 and after abandoning terror
and delight, and after becoming neutral in the investigation of
formations, he still persists in the triple contemplation. And in so
doing, this \[insight knowledge\] enters upon the state of the triple
gateway to liberation, and it becomes a condition for the classification
of noble persons into seven kinds.



\[THE  TRIPLE  GATEWAY  TO  LIBERATION\]



It enters upon the state of the triple gateway to liberation now with
the predominance of \[one of\] three faculties according as the
contemplation occurs in \[one of\] the three ways.32



[67.]For it is the three contemplations that are called the
three gateways to liberation, according as it is said: "But these three
gateways to liberation lead to the outlet from the world, \[that is to
say,\] (i) to the seeing of all formations as limited and circumscribed
and to the entering of consciousness into the signless element, (ii) to
the stirring up of the mind with respect to all formations and to the
entering of consciousness into the desireless element, (iii) to the
seeing of all things (*dhamma*) as alien and to the entering of
consciousness into the voidness element. These three gateways to
liberation lead to the outlet from the world" (Paṭis II 48).33



31\. *Vaṭṭayamāna---*"sifting": not in PED; Vism-mhṭ glosses with
*niccoriyamāna*, also not in PED. *Nibbaṭṭita---*"picked out": not in
PED. Vism-mhṭ glosses *nibbaṭṭita-kappāsaṃ* with 
*nibaṭṭita-bīja-kappāsaṃ*."  *Vihaṭamāna---*"carding": not in PED;
glossed by Vism- mhṭ with *dhūnakena* (not in PED) *vihaññamānaṃ viya*
(Vism-mhṭ 844).



32\. When insight reaches its culmination, it settles down in one of the
three contemplations \[impermanence, pain, or not-self\] and at this
stage of the development the "seven contemplations" and the "eighteen
contemplations" (or "principal insights") are all included by the three
(see Vism-mhṭ 844).\



33\. "Contemplation of impermanence sees formations as limited by rise
in the beginning and by fall in the end, and it sees that it is because
they have a beginning and an end that they are impermanent. '*Into the
signless element*': into the unformed element, which is given the name
'signless' because it is the opposite of the sign of formations. '*To
the entering of consciousness*': to the higher consciousness's
completely going into by means of the state of conformity knowledge,
after delimiting. '*Into the desireless*': into the unformed element,
which is given the name 'desireless' owing to the non-existence of
desire due to greed and so on. '*Into the void*': into the unformed
element, which is given the name 'void' because of voidness of self"
(Vism-mhṭ 845).



34\. "One who is pursuing insight by discerning formations according to
their sign by means of the contemplation of impermanence and resolves
according to the signless aspect thus, 'Where this sign of formations is
entirely nonexistent, that is, the signless Nibbāna' joins insight
leading to emergence with the path. Then the path realizes Nibbāna for
him as signless. The signless aspect of Nibbāna is not created by the
path or by insight; on the contrary, it is the establishment of the
individual essence of



[]



[]



[68.] Herein, *as limited and circumscribed* \[means\] both as
limited by rise and fall and as circumscribed by them; for contemplation
of impermanence limits them thus, "Formations do not exist previous to
their rise," and in seeking their destiny, sees them as circumscribed
thus, "They do not go beyond fall, they vanish there." *To the stirring
up of the mind*: by giving consciousness a sense of urgency; for with
the contemplation of pain consciousness acquires a sense of urgency with
respect to formations. \[658\] *To the seeing* ... *as alien*: to
contemplating them as not- self thus: "Not I," "Not mine."



[69.]So these three clauses should be understood to express the
contemplations of impermanence, and so on. Hence in the answer to the
next question \[asked in the Paṭisambhidā\] it is said: "When he brings
\[them\] to mind as impermanent, formations appear as liable to
destruction. When he brings them to mind as painful, formations appear
as a terror. When he brings them to mind as not-self, formations appear
as void" (Paṭis II 48).



[70.]What are the liberations to which these contemplations are
the gateways? They are these three, namely, the signless, the
desireless, and the void. For this is said: "When one who has great
resolution brings \[formations\] to mind as impermanent, he acquires the
signless liberation. When one who has great tranquillity brings \[them\]
to mind as painful, he acquires the desireless liberation. When one who
has great wisdom brings \[them\] to mind as not-self, he acquires the
void liberation" (Paṭis II 58).



[71.]And here the *signless liberation* should be understood as
the noble path that has occurred by making Nibbāna its object through
the signless aspect. For that path is signless owing to the signless
element having arisen, and it is a liberation owing to deliverance from
defilements.34 In the same way the path that has occurred by making
Nibbāna its object through the desireless aspect is *desireless*. And
the path that has occurred by making Nibbāna its object through the void
aspect is void.



[72.]But it is said in the Abhidhamma: "On the occasion when he
develops the supramundane jhāna that is an outlet and leads to
dispersal, having abandoned the field of \[false\] views with the
reaching of the first grade, secluded from sense desires he enters upon
and dwells in the first jhāna, which is desireless ... is void," (Dhs
§510) thus mentioning only two liberations. This refers to the way in
which insight arrives \[at the path\] and is expressed literally.



[73.]However, in the Paṭisambhidā insight knowledge is
expressed as follows: (i) It is expressed firstly as the void liberation
by its liberating from misinterpreting \[formations\]: "Knowledge of
contemplation of impermanence is the void liberation since it liberates
from interpreting \[them\] as permanent; knowledge of contemplation of
pain is the void liberation since it liberates from interpreting



Nibbāna, and the path is called signless because it has that as its
object. One who resolves upon the desireless by keeping desire away by
means of the contemplation of pain, and one who resolves upon the void
by keeping the belief in self away by means of the contemplation of
not-self, should both be construed in the same way" (Vism-mhṭ 846).



[]



[]



\[them\] as pleasant; knowledge of contemplation of not-self is the void
liberation since it liberates from interpreting \[them\] as self" (Paṭis
II 67). (ii) Then it is expressed as the signless liberation by
liberating from signs: "Knowledge of contemplation of impermanence is
the signless liberation since it liberates from the sign \[of
formations\] as permanent; knowledge of contemplation of pain is the
signless liberation since it liberates from the sign \[of formations\]
as pleasant; knowledge of contemplation of not-self is the signless
liberation since it liberates from the sign \[of formations\] as self"
(Paṭis II 68). \[659\] (iii) Lastly it is expressed as the desireless
liberation by its liberating from desire: "Knowledge of contemplation of
impermanence is the desireless liberation since it liberates from desire
\[for formations\] as permanent; knowledge of contemplation of pain is
the desireless liberation since it liberates from the desire \[for
them\] as pleasant; knowledge of contemplation of not-self is the
desireless liberation since it liberates from the desire \[for them\] as
self" (Paṭis II 68). But although stated in this way, insight knowledge
is not literally signless because there is no abandoning of the sign of
formations \[as formed, here, as distinct from their sign as impermanent
and so on\]. It is however literally void and desireless. And it is at
the moment of the noble path that the liberation is distinguished, and
that is done according to insight knowledge's way of arrival at the
path.35 That, it



35\. "Why is signless insight unable to give its own name to the path
when it has come to the point of arrival at the path? Of course,
signless insight is mentioned in the suttas thus, 'Develop the signless
and get rid of the inherent tendency to conceit' (Sn 342). Nevertheless,
though it eliminates the signs of permanence, of lastingness, and of
self, it still possesses a sign itself and is occupied with states that
possess a sign. Again, the Abhidhamma is the teaching in the ultimate
sense, and in the ultimate sense the cause of a signless path is
wanting. For the signless liberation is stated in accordance with the
contemplation of impermanence, and in that the faith faculty
predominates. But the faith faculty is not represented by any one of the
factors of the path. And so it cannot give its name to the path since it
forms no part of it. In the case of the other two, the desireless
liberation is due to the contemplation of pain, and the void liberation
is due to the contemplation of not-self. Now the concentration faculty
predominates in the desireless liberation and the understanding faculty
in the void liberation. So since these are factors of the path as well,
they can give their own names to the path; but there is no signless path
because the factor is wanting. So some say. But there are others who say
that there is a signless path, and that although it does not get its
name from the way insight arrives at it, still it gets its name from a
special quality of its own and from its object. In their opinion the
desireless and void paths should also get their names from special
qualities of their own and from their objects too. That is wrong. Why?
Because the path gets its names for two reasons, that is, because of its
own nature and because of what it opposes---the meaning is, because of
its individual essence and because of what it is contrary to. For the
desireless path is free from desire due to greed, etc., and the void
path is free from greed too, so they both get their names from their
individual essence. Similarly, the desireless path is the contrary of
desire and the void path is the contrary of misinterpretation as self,
so they get their names from what they oppose. On the other hand, the
signless path gets its name only from its own nature owing to the
non-existence in it of the signs of greed, etc., or of the signs of
permanence, etc., but not owing to what it opposes. For it

should be understood, is why only two liberations are stated \[in the
Abhidhamma\], namely, the desireless and the void.



This, firstly, is the treatise on the liberations here.



\[THE SEVEN KINDS OF NOBLE PERSONS\]



[74.] It was said above, "It becomes a condition for the
classification of noble persons into seven kinds." (§66) Herein, there
are firstly these seven kinds of noble person: (1) the faith devotee,
(2) one liberated by faith, (3) the body witness, (4) the both-ways
liberated, (5) the Dhamma devotee, (6) one attained to vision, and (7)
one liberated by understanding. This knowledge of equanimity about
formations is a condition for their being placed as these seven classes.



[75.] When a man brings \[formations\] to mind as impermanent
and, having great resolution, acquires the faith faculty, (1) he becomes
a faith devotee at the moment of the stream-entry path; and in the other
seven instances \[that is, in the three higher paths and the four
fruitions\] he becomes (2) one liberated by faith. When a man brings
\[them\] to mind as painful and, having great tranquillity, acquires the
faculty of concentration, (3) he is called a body witness in all eight
instances. (4) He is called both-ways liberated when he has reached the
highest fruition after also reaching the immaterial jhānas. When a man
brings \[them\] to mind as not-self and, having great wisdom, acquires
the faculty of understanding, he becomes (5) a Dhamma devotee at the
moment of the stream-entry path; (6) in the next six instances he
becomes one attained to vision; and (7) in the case of the highest
fruition he becomes one liberated by understanding.



[76.] (1) This is said: "When he brings \[formations\] to mind
as impermanent, the faith faculty is in excess in him. With the faith
faculty in excess he acquires the stream-entry path. Hence he is called
a 'faith devotee'" (Paṭis II 53). \[660\] Likewise, (2) "When he brings
\[formations\] to mind as impermanent, the faith faculty is in excess in
him. With the faith faculty in excess the fruition of stream- entry is
realized. Hence he is called 'one liberated by faith'" (Paṭis II 53).



does not oppose the contemplation of impermanence, which has as its
object the sign of formations \[as formed\], but remains in agreement
with it. So a signless path is altogether inadmissible by the Abhidhamma
method. This is why it is said, 'This refers to the way in which insight
arrives at the path and is expressed in the literal sense' (§72).
"However, by the Suttanta method a signless path is admissible. For
according to that, in whatever way insight leading to emergence (see
§83) effects its comprehending it still leads on to emergence of the
path, and when it is at the point of arrival it gives its own name to
the path accordingly---when emerging owing to comprehension as
impermanent the path is signless, when emerging owing to comprehension
as painful it is desireless, and when emerging owing to comprehension as
not-self it is void. Taking this as a sutta commentary, therefore, three
liberations are differentiated here. But in the Paṭisambhidā the
deliverance from misinterpreting, from the sign and from desire, are
taken respectively as the arrival of the three kinds of comprehension at
that deliverance, and what is described is a corresponding state of void
liberation, etc., respectively in the paths that follow upon that
deliverance. There is no question of treating that literally, which is
why he said, 'However, in the Paṭisambhidā insight knowledge' and so on"
(Vism-mhṭ 846--48).



[]



[]



[77.]It is said further: "\[At the moment of the first path:\]
(2) he has been liberated by having faith (*saddahanto vimutto)*, thus
he is one liberated by faith; (3) he has realized \[Nibbāna\] by
experiencing, thus he is a body witness; (6) he has attained \[Nibbāna\]
by vision, thus he is one attained to vision. \[At the moments of the
three remaining paths:\] (2) he is liberated by faith (*saddahanto
vimuccati*), thus he is one liberated by faith; (3) he first experiences
the experience of jhāna and afterwards realizes cessation, Nibbāna, thus
he is a body witness; (6) it is known, seen, recognized, realized, and
experienced with understanding, that formations are painful and
cessation is bliss, thus he is one attained to vision" (Paṭis II 52).



[78.]As to the remaining four, however, the word meaning should
be understood thus: (1) he follows (*anusarati*) faith, thus he is a
faith devotee (*saddhānusāri*); or he follows, he goes, by means of
faith, thus he is a faith devotee. (5) Likewise, he follows the Dhamma
called understanding, or he follows by means of the Dhamma, thus he is a
Dhamma devotee. (4) He is liberated in both ways, by immaterial jhāna
and the noble path, thus he is both-ways liberated. (7) Understanding,
he is liberated, thus he is one liberated by understanding.



\[THE LAST THREE KNOWLEDGES ARE ONE\]



[79.]This \[knowledge of equanimity about formations\] is the
same in meaning as the two kinds that precede it. Hence the Ancients
said: "This knowledge of equanimity about formations is one only and has
three names. At the outset it has the name of knowledge of desire for
deliverance. In the middle it has the name knowledge of reflection. At
the end, when it has reached its culmination, it is called knowledge of
equanimity about formations."



[80.]"How is it that understanding of desire for deliverance,
of reflection, and of composure is knowledge of the kinds of equanimity
about formations? Understanding of desire for deliverance, of
reflection, and composure \[occupied with\] arising is knowledge of
equanimity about formations. Understanding of desire for deliverance, of
reflection, and of composure \[occupied with\] occurrence ... the sign
... (etc., see §37) ... with despair is knowledge of equanimity about
formations" (Paṭis I 60f.).



[81.] Herein, the compound
*muñcitukamyatā-paṭisaṅkhā-santiṭṭhanā* ("consisting in desire for
deliverance, in reflection, and in composure") should be resolved into
*muñcitukamyatā ca sā paṭisaṅkhā ca santiṭṭhanā ca*. So \[661\] in the
first stage it is desire to give up, the desire to be delivered from,
arising, etc., in one who has become dispassionate by knowledge of
dispassion that is *desire for deliverance*. It is reflection in the
middle stage for the purpose of finding a means to deliverance that is
*reflection*. It is equanimous onlooking in the end stage on being
delivered that is *composure*. It is said with reference to this:
"Arising is formations; he looks with equanimity on those formations;
thus it is equanimity about formations" (Paṭis I 61), and so on. So this
is only one kind of knowledge.



[82.]Furthermore, it may be understood that this is so from the
following text; for this is said: "Desire for deliverance, and
contemplation of reflection, and equanimity about formations: these
things are one in meaning and only the letter is different" (Paṭis II
64).

\[INSIGHT LEADING TO EMERGENCE\]



[83.]Now, when this clansman has reached equanimity about
formations thus, his insight has reached its culmination and leads to
emergence. "Insight that has reached culmination" or "insight leading to
emergence" are names for the three kinds of knowledge beginning with
equanimity about formations, \[that is, equanimity about formations,
conformity, and change-of-lineage\]. It has "reached its culmination"
because it has reached the culminating final stage. It is called
"leading to emergence" because it goes towards emergence. The path is
called "emergence" because it emerges externally from the objective
basis interpreted as a sign and also internally from occurrence \[of
defilement\].36 It goes to that, thus it leads to emergence; the meaning
is that it joins with the path.



[84.] Herein, for the purpose of clarification there is this
list of the kinds of emergence classed according to the manner of
interpreting: (1) after interpreting the internal37 it emerges from the
internal, (2) after interpreting the internal it emerges from the
external, (3) after interpreting the external it emerges from the
external, (4) after interpreting the external it emerges from the
internal; (5) after interpreting the material it emerges from the
material, (6) after interpreting the material it emerges from the
immaterial, (7) after interpreting the immaterial it emerges from the
immaterial, (8) after interpreting the immaterial it emerges from the
material; (9) it emerges at one stroke from the five aggregates; (10)
after interpreting as impermanent it emerges from the impermanent, (11)
after interpreting as impermanent it emerges from the painful, (12)
after interpreting as impermanent it emerges from the not-self; (13)
after interpreting as painful it emerges from the painful, (14) after
interpreting as painful it emerges from the impermanent, (15) after
interpreting as painful it emerges from the not-self, (16) after
interpreting as not-self it emerges from the not-self, (17) after
interpreting as not-self it emerges from the impermanent, (18) after
interpreting as not-self it emerges from the painful. How?



36\. "'*From the object interpreted as the sign*': from the pentad of
aggregates as the object of insight; for that pentad of aggregates is
called the 'object interpreted' on account of the interpreting, in other
words, on account of being made the domain of insight. And although it
is included in one's own continuity, it is nevertheless called
'external' because it is seen as alien to it; it is that too which in
other contexts is spoken of as 'externally from all signs' (Paṭis I 71).
'Internally from occurrence': from the occurrence of wrong view, etc.,
in one's own continuity, and from the defilements and from the
aggregates that occur consequent upon them. For it is stated in this way
because there is occurrence of defilement in one's own continuity and
because there is occurrence of clung-to aggregates produced by that
\[defilement\] when there is no path development. And emergence consists
both in making these the object and in producing their non-liability to
future arising" (Vism-mhṭ 853).



37\. "'*Emerges from the internal*' is said figuratively owing to the
fact that in this case the insight leading to emergence has an internal
state as its object. In the literal sense, however, the path emerges
from both" (Vism-mhṭ 853).



[]



[]



[85.]Here (1) someone does his interpreting at the start with
his own internal formations. After interpreting them he sees them. But
emergence of the path does not come about through seeing the bare
internal only since the external must be seen too, so he sees that
another's aggregates, as well as unclung-to formations \[inanimate
things\], are impermanent, painful, not-self. At one time \[662\] he
comprehends the internal and at another time the external. As he does
so, insight joins with the path while he is comprehending the internal.
It is said of him that "after interpreting the internal it emerges from
the internal." (2) If his insight joins with the path at the time when
he is comprehending the external, it is said of him that "after
interpreting the internal it emerges from the external." (3) Similarly
in the case of "after interpreting the external it emerges from the
external," and (4) "from the internal."



[86.](5) Another does his interpreting at the start with
materiality. When he has done that, he sees the materiality of the
primaries and the materiality derived from them all together. But
emergence does not come about through the seeing of bare materiality
only since the immaterial must be seen too, so he sees as the immaterial
\[mentality\] the feeling, perception, formations and consciousness that
have arisen by making that materiality their object. At one time he
comprehends the material and at another the immaterial. As he does so,
insight joins with the path while he is comprehending materiality. It is
said of him that "after interpreting the material it emerges from the
material." (6) But if his insight joins with the path at the time when
he is comprehending the immaterial, it is said of him that "after
interpreting the material it emerges from the immaterial." (7) Similarly
in the case of "after interpreting the immaterial it emerges from the
immaterial," and (8) "from the material."



[87.] (9) When he has done his interpreting in this way, "All
that is subject to arising is subject to cessation" (M I 380), and so
too at the time of emergence, it is said that "it emerges at one stroke
from the five aggregates."



[88.] (10) One man comprehends formations as impermanent at the
start. But emergence does not come about through mere comprehending as
impermanent since there must be comprehension of them as painful and
not-self too, so he comprehends them as painful and not-self. As he does
so, emergence comes about while he is comprehending them as impermanent.
It is said of him that "after interpreting as impermanent it emerges
from the impermanent," (11)-- (12) But if emergence comes about in him
while he is comprehending them as painful ... as not-self, then it is
said that "after interpreting as impermanent it emerges from the painful
... from the not-self." Similarly in the cases of emergence after
interpreting (13)--(15) as painful and (16)--(18) as not-self.



[89.] And whether they have interpreted \[at the start\] as
impermanent or as painful or as not-self, when the time of emergence
comes, if the emergence takes place \[while contemplating\] as
impermanent, then all three persons acquire the faculty of faith since
they have great resolution; they are liberated by the signless
liberation, and so they become faith devotees at the moment of the first
path; and in the remaining seven stages they are liberated by faith.
\[663\] If the emergence is from the painful, then the three persons
acquire the faculty of concentration



[]



[]



since they have great tranquillity; they are liberated by the desireless
liberation, and in all eight states they are body witnesses. Of them,
the one who has an immaterial jhāna as the basis for his insight is, in
the case of the highest fruition, both-ways liberated. And then if the
emergence takes place \[while contemplating\] as not-self, the three
persons acquire the faculty of understanding since they have great
wisdom; they are liberated by the void liberation. They become Dhamma
devotees at the moment of the first path. In the next six instances they
become attained to vision. In the case of the highest fruit they are
liberated by understanding.



\[THE  TWELVE  SIMILES\]



[90.]Now, twelve similes should be understood in order to
explain this insight leading to emergence and the kinds of knowledge
that precede and follow it. Here is the list:



\(1\) The fruit bat, (2) the black snake, and (3) the house,\
(4) The oxen, and(5) the ghoul, (6) the child,\
(7) Hunger, and (8) thirst, and (9) cold, and (10) heat,\
And (11) darkness, and (12) by poison, too.



A pause can be made to bring in these similes anywhere among the kinds
of knowledge from appearance as terror onwards. But if they are brought
in here, then all becomes clear from appearance as terror up to fruition
knowledge, which is why it was said that they should be brought in
here.38



[91.]*1. The Fruit Bat.* There was a fruit bat, it seems. She
had alighted on a honey tree (*madhuka*) with five branches, thinking,
"I shall find flowers or fruits here." She investigated one branch but
saw no flowers or fruits there worth taking. And as with the first so
too she tried the second, the third, the fourth, and the fifth, but saw
nothing. She thought, "This tree is barren; there is nothing worth
taking here," so she lost interest in the tree. She climbed up on a
straight branch, and poking her head through a gap in the foliage, she
looked upwards, flew up into the air and alighted on another tree.



[92.]Herein, the meditator should be regarded as like the fruit
bat. The five aggregates as objects of clinging are like the honey tree
with the five branches. The meditator's interpreting of the five
aggregates is like the fruit bat's alighting on the tree. His
comprehending the materiality aggregate and, seeing nothing there worth
taking, comprehending the remaining aggregates is like her trying each
branch and, seeing nothing there worth taking, trying the rest. His
triple knowledge beginning with desire for deliverance, after he has
become dispassionate towards the five aggregates \[664\] through seeing
their characteristic of impermanence, etc., is like her thinking "This
tree is barren; there is nothing worth taking here" and losing interest.
His conformity knowledge is like her climbing up the straight branch.
His change-of- lineage knowledge is like her poking her head out and
looking upwards. His path knowledge is like her flying up into the air.
His fruition knowledge is like her alighting on a different tree.



[38.]"Said in the Discourse on Purification (*visuddhi-kathā*)"
(Vism-mhṭ 855). See XX.77.



[]



[]



[93.] *2.*  *The Black Snake.* This simile has already been
given (§49). But the application of the simile here is this.
Change-of-lineage knowledge is like throwing the snake away. Path
knowledge is like the man's standing and looking back whence he had come
after getting free from it. Fruition knowledge is like his standing in a
place free from fear after he had got away. This is the difference.



[94.] *3.*  *The House.* The owner of a house, it seems, ate
his meal in the evening, climbed into his bed and fell asleep. The house
caught fire. When he woke up and saw the fire, he was frightened. He
thought, "It would be good if I could get out without getting burnt."
Looking round, he saw a way. Getting out, he quickly went away to a safe
place and stayed there.



[95.] Herein, the foolish ordinary man's taking the five
aggregates as "I" and "mine" is like the house-owner's falling asleep
after he had eaten and climbed into bed. Knowledge of appearance as
terror after entering upon the right way and seeing the three
characteristics is like the time when the man was frightened on waking
up and seeing the fire. Knowledge of desire for deliverance is like the
man's looking for a way out. Conformity knowledge is like the man's
seeing the way. Change-of-lineage is like the man's going away quickly.
Fruition knowledge is like his staying in a safe place.



[96.] *4. The Oxen.* One night, it seems, while a farmer was
sleeping his oxen broke out of their stable and escaped. When he went
there at dawn and looked in, he found that they had escaped. Going to
find them, he saw the king's oxen. He thought that they were his and
drove them back. When it got light, he recognized that they were not his
but the king's oxen. He was frightened. Thinking, "I shall escape before
the king's men seize me for a thief and bring me to ruin and
destruction," he abandoned the oxen. Escaping quickly, he stopped in a
place free from fear.



[97.] Herein, the foolish ordinary man's taking the five
aggregates as "I" and "mine" is like the man's taking the king's oxen.
The meditator's recognizing the five aggregates as impermanent, painful,
and not-self by means of the three characteristics is like the man's
recognizing the oxen as the king's when it got light. Knowledge of
appearance as terror is like the time when the man was frightened.
Desire for deliverance is like the man's desire to leave them and go
away. Change-of-lineage is like the man's actual leaving. The path is
like his escaping. Fruition is like the man's staying in a place without
fear after escaping. \[665\]



[98.] *5.* *The Ghoul.* A man went to live with a ghoul, it
seems. At night, thinking he was asleep, she went to the place where the
dead were exposed and ate human flesh. He wondered where she was going
and followed her. When he saw her eating human flesh, he knew that she
was a non-human being. He was frightened, and he thought, "I shall
escape before she eats me." Quickly escaping, he went to a safe place
and stayed there.



[99.] Herein, taking the aggregates as "I" and "mine" is like
the man's living with the ghoul. Recognizing the aggregates as
impermanent, etc., by seeing the three characteristics is like the man's
recognizing that she was a ghoul on seeing her eating human flesh in the
place for the dead. Appearance as terror is

like the time when the man was frightened. Desire for deliverance is
like his desire to escape. Change-of-lineage is like his leaving the
place for the dead. The path is like his escaping quickly. Fruition is
like his standing in the place without fear.



[100.] *6.* *The Child.* A woman was very fond of her son, it
seems. While sitting on an upper floor she heard the sound of a child in
the street. Wondering, "Is someone hurting my child?," she hurried down.
Mistaking the child for her own son, she picked up someone else's son.
Then she recognized that it was someone else's son, and she was ashamed
and looked about her. She thought, "Let no one say I am a baby thief"
and she put the child down there and then, and she quickly returned to
the upper floor and sat down.



[101.] Herein, taking the five aggregates as "I" and "mine" is
like the woman's mistaking someone else's child for her own. The
recognition that "This is not I, not mine" by means of the three
characteristics is like her recognizing it as someone else's child.
Knowledge of desire for deliverance is like her looking about her.
Conformity knowledge is like her putting the child down there and then.
Change-of-lineage is like the time when she stood in the street after
putting the child down. The path is like her return to the upper floor.
Fruition is like her sitting down after returning.



[102.]*7--12.* *Hunger, Thirst, Cold, Heat, Darkness, and By
Poison*. These six similes, however, are given for the purpose of
showing that one with insight that leads to emergence tends, inclines
and leans in the direction of the supramundane states.



[103.] *7.* Just as a man faint with hunger and famished longs
for delicious food, so too the meditator famished with the hunger of the
round of rebirths longs for the food consisting of mindfulness occupied
with the body, which tastes of the deathless.



[104.] *8.* Just as a thirsty man whose throat and mouth are
parched longs for a drink with many ingredients, so too this meditator
\[666\] who is parched with the thirst of the round of rebirths longs
for the noble drink of the Eightfold Path.



[105.] *9.* Just as a man frozen by cold longs for heat, so too
this meditator frozen by the cold of craving and \[selfish\] affection
in the round of rebirths longs for the fire of the path that burns up
the defilements.



[106.] *10.* Just as a man faint with heat longs for cold, so
too this meditator scorched by the burning of the eleven fires (see S IV
19) in the round of rebirths longs for Nibbāna.



[107.] *11.* Just as a man smothered in darkness longs for
light, so too this meditator wrapped and enveloped in the darkness of
ignorance longs for the light of knowledge consisting in path
development.



[108.] *12.* Just as a man sick with poison longs for an
antidote, so too this meditator sick with the poison of defilement longs
for Nibbāna, the deathless medicine that destroys the poison of
defilement.



[109.] That is why it was said above: "When he knows and sees
thus, his heart retreats, retracts and recoils from the three kinds of
becoming, the four kinds of generation, the five kinds of destiny, the
seven stations of consciousness, and the



[]



[]



nine abodes of beings; his heart no longer goes out to them. Just as
water drops retreat, retract and recoil on a lotus leaf that slopes a
little ..." (§63), all of which should be given in the way already
stated.



[110.] But at this point he is called "one who walks aloof,"
with reference to whom it is said:



"When a bhikkhu keeps apart\
And cultivates seclusion of the mind,\
It will befit him, as they say,\
To show himself no more in this becoming" (Sn 810).



\[THE DIFFERENCE IN THE NOBLE PATH'S FACTORS, ETC.\]



[111.] This knowledge of equanimity about formations governs
the fact that the meditator keeps apart. It furthermore governs the
difference in the \[number of the\] noble path's enlightenment factors,
path factors, and jhāna factors, the mode of progress, and the kind of
liberation. For while some elders say that it is the jhāna used as the
basis for insight \[leading to emergence\] that governs the difference
in the \[number of\] enlightenment factors, path factors, and jhāna
factors, and some say that it is the aggregates made the object of
insight that govern it, and some say that it is the personal bent that
governs it,39 yet it is only this preliminary insight and insight
leading to emergence that should be understood to govern it in their
doctrine.



[112.] To deal with these \[three theories\] in order:
According to governance by insight, the path arisen in a bare-insight
(dry-insight) worker, and the path arisen in one who possesses a jhāna
attainment but who has not made the jhāna the basis for insight, and the
path made to arise by comprehending unrelated formations after using the
first jhāna as the basis for insight, are \[667\] paths of the first
jhāna only. In each case there are seven enlightenment factors, eight
path factors, and five jhāna factors. For while their preliminary
insight can be accompanied by joy and it can be accompanied by
equanimity, when their insight reaches the state of equanimity about
formations at the time of emergence it is accompanied by joy.



[113.] When paths are made to arise by using the second, third,
and fourth jhānas in the fivefold reckoning as the basis for insight,
then the jhāna in those paths has respectively four, three, and two
factors. In each case, however, the path factors number seven, and in
the fourth case there are six enlightenment factors. This difference is
due both to governance by the basic jhāna and to governance by insight.
For again, while their preliminary insight can be accompanied by joy and
it can be accompanied by equanimity, their insight leading to emergence
is accompanied by joy only.



[114.] However, when the path is produced by making the fifth
jhāna the basis



for insight, then the jhāna factors number two, that is, equanimity and
unification



39\. "The first '*some*' refers to the Elder Tipiṭaka Cūḷa-Nāga. The
second '*some*' refers to the Elder Mahā Datta, dweller at Moravāpi. The
third 'some' refers to the Elder Tipiṭaka Cūḷa Abhaya" (Vism-mhṭ 856).



[]



[]



of the mind, and there are six enlightenment factors and seven path
factors. This difference too is due to both kinds of governance. For in
this case the preliminary insight is either accompanied by joy or
accompanied by equanimity, but that leading to emergence is accompanied
by equanimity only. The same method applies in the case of the path made
to arise by making the immaterial jhānas the basis for insight.



Also when, after emerging from jhāna made the basis for insight, the
path has been produced by comprehending no matter what formations
\[unrelated to that jhāna\], then it is the attainment emerged from at
the point nearest to the path that makes it like itself, as the colour
of the soil does an monitor lizard's colour.



[115.] But in the case of the second elder's theory the path is
like the attainment, whatever it may be, which was instrumental in
producing the path through the comprehension of any of its states after
emergence from it. And here governance by insight should be understood
in the same way as before.



[116.] In the case of the third elder's theory the path is like
that jhāna, whichever it may be, that suits the personal bent, which
jhāna was instrumental in producing the path through the comprehension
of any of its states in using it as the basis for insight. But this is
not accomplished by mere bent alone unless the jhāna has been made the
basis for insight or unless the jhāna has been comprehended; and this
meaning should be illustrated by the Nandakovāda Sutta (see M III 277,
and Commentary). And here too, governance by insight should be
understood in the same way as before.



This, firstly, is how it should be understood that equanimity about
formations



governs the \[numbers of\] enlightenment factors, path factors, and
jhāna factors.



[117.] \[*Progress.*\] But if \[insight\] has from the start
only been able to suppress defilements with difficulty, with effort and
with prompting, then it is called "of difficult progress." \[668\] The
opposite kind is called "of easy progress." And when the manifestation
of the path, the goal of insight, is slowly effected after defilements
have been suppressed, then it is called "of sluggish direct- knowledge."
The opposite kind is called "of swift direct-knowledge." So this
equanimity about formations stands at the arrival point and gives its
own name to the path in each case, and so the path has four names
\[according to the kind of progress\] (see D III 228).



[118.] For one bhikkhu this progress is different in the four
paths, while for another it is the same. For Buddhas, however, the four
paths are of easy progress and swift direct-knowledge. Likewise in the
case of the General of the Dhamma \[the Elder Sāriputta\]. But in the
Elder Mahā Moggallāna's case the first path was of easy progress and
swift direct-knowledge, but the others were of difficult progress and
sluggish direct-knowledge.



[119.]\[*Predominance.*\] And as with the kinds of progress, so
also with the kinds of predominance,40 which are different in the four
paths for one bhikkhu and the



40\. The four predominances are those of zeal (desire), energy,
consciousness, and inquiry. Cf. four roads to power (Dhs §73--74; Vibh
216 and Comy.).



[]



[]



same for another. So it is equanimity about formations that governs the
difference in the progress.



\[*Liberation.*\] But it has already been told how it governs the
difference in the



liberation \[§66f.\].



[120.] Furthermore, the path gets its names for five reasons,
that is to say, (1) owing to its own nature, or (2) owing to what it
opposes, or (3) owing to its own special quality, or (4) owing to its
object, or (5) owing to the way of arrival.



[121.] *1.* If equanimity about formations induces emergence by
comprehending formations as impermanent, liberation takes place with the
signless liberation. If it induces emergence by comprehending them as
painful, liberation takes place with the desireless liberation. If it
induces emergence by comprehending them as not-self, liberation takes
place with the void liberation. This is its name according to *its own
nature*.



[122.] *2.* When this path is arrived at with the abandoning of
the signs of permanence, lastingness, and eternalness, by effecting the
resolution of the compact in formations by means of the contemplation of
impermanence, it is then called signless. When it is arrived at with the
drying up of desire and longing, by abandoning perception of pleasure by
means of the contemplation of pain, it is then called desireless. When
formations are seen as void by abandoning perception of self, of a
living being, of a person, by means of the contemplation of not-self, it
is then called void. This is its name according to *what it opposes*.



[123.] *3.* It is void because void of greed, and so on. It is
signless owing either to absence of the sign of materiality, etc., or to
absence only of the sign of greed, and so on. It is desireless because
of absence of desire as greed, and so on. This is its name according to
its *own special quality*.



[124.] *4.* It is called void, signless, and desireless, too,
because it makes the void, signless, desireless Nibbāna its object. This
is its name according to *its object*. \[669\]



[125.] *5.* The way of arrival is twofold, namely, insight's
way of arrival applies to



the path, and the path's way of arrival applies to fruition.



Now, contemplation of not-self is called void and the path \[arrived
at\] by void



insight is \[called\] void.



Again, contemplation of impermanence is called signless and the path



\[arrived at\] by signless insight is \[called\] signless.



[126.]But while this name is inadmissible by the Abhidhamma
method,41 it is admissible by the Suttanta method; for, they say, by
that method change-of- lineage takes the name "signless" by making the
signless Nibbāna its object, and while itself remaining at the arrival
point, it gives its name to the path.



41\. "If this is so, then is the path that follows on the contemplation
of impermanence not included in the Abhidhamma?---That is not so; for it
is included in the method of 'simple progress' (*suddhika
paṭipadā---*see Dhs §§339--340)" (Vism-mhṭ 861).



[]



[]



Hence the path is called signless. And its fruition can be called
signless too according to the path's way of arrival.



[127.] Lastly, contemplation of pain is called desireless
because it arrives \[at the path\] by drying up desire for formations.
The path \[arrived at\] by desireless insight is \[called\] desireless.
The fruition of the desireless path is \[called\] desireless.



In this way insight gives its own name to the path, and the path hands
it on to



its fruition. This is its name according to *the way of arrival.*



This is how equanimity about formations governs the difference in the



liberations.



Equanimity about formations is ended.



\[9. CONFORMITY KNOWLEDGE\]



[128.] As he repeats, develops and cultivates that equanimity
about formations, his faith becomes more resolute, his energy better
exerted, his mindfulness better established, his mind better
concentrated, while his equanimity about formations grows more refined.



[129.] He thinks, "Now the path will arise." Equanimity about
formations, after comprehending formations as impermanent, or as
painful, or as not-self, sinks into the life-continuum. Next to the
life-continuum, mind-door adverting arises making formations its object
as impermanent or as painful or as not-self according to the way taken
by equanimity about formations. Then next to the functional
\[adverting\] consciousness that arose displacing the life-continuum,
the first impulsion consciousness arises making formations its object in
the same way, maintaining the continuity of consciousness.42 This is
called the "preliminary work." Next to that a second impulsion
consciousness arises making formations its object in the same way. This
is called the "access." Next to that \[670\] a third impulsion
consciousness also arises making formations its object in the same way.
This is called "conformity."



[130.] These are their individual names. But it is admissible
to call all three impulsions "repetition" or "preliminary-work" or
"access" or "conformity" indiscriminately.



Conformity to what? To what precedes and to what follows. For it
conforms to the functions of truth both in the eight preceding kinds of
insight knowledge and in the thirty-seven states partaking of
enlightenment that follow.



42\. "'*Maintaining the continuity of consciousness*' by absence of
interruption, in other words, of occurrence of dissimilar consciousness.
For when the life-continuum \[which is mind-consciousness element\] is
displaced by the functional mind element \[of five- door adverting
(70)\], the occurrence of the functional consciousness makes an
interruption, an interval, between the occurrence of the resultant
consciousness \[i.e. the life-continuum and the consciousness that
follows\]. But this is not so with mind- door adverting (71) \[which is
mind-consciousness element\]" (Vism-mhṭ 862). See Table V, Cognitive
Series.



[]



[]



[131.] Since its occurrence is contingent upon formations
through \[compre- hending\] the characteristics of impermanence, etc.,
it, so to speak, says, "Knowledge of rise and fall indeed saw the rise
and fall of precisely those states that possess rise and fall" and
"Contemplation of dissolution indeed saw the dissolution of precisely
those states that possess dissolution" and "It was indeed precisely what
was terrible that appeared as terror to \[knowledge of\] appearance as
terror" and "Contemplation of danger indeed saw danger in precisely what
was dangerous" and "Knowledge of dispassion indeed became dispassionate
towards precisely that which should be regarded with dispassion" and
"Knowledge of desire for deliverance indeed produced desire for
deliverance from precisely what there should be deliverance from" and
"What was reflected upon by knowledge of reflection was indeed precisely
what should be reflected upon" and "What was looked on at with
equanimity by equanimity about formations was indeed precisely what
should be looked on at with equanimity." So it conforms to the functions
of truth both in these eight kinds of knowledge and in the thirty-seven
states partaking of enlightenment which follow, because they are to be
reached by entering upon it.



[132.] Just as a righteous king, who sits in the place of
judgement hearing the pronouncements of the judges while excluding bias
and remaining impartial, conforms both to their pronouncements and to
the ancient royal custom by saying, "So be it," so it is here too.



[133.] Conformity is like the king. The eight kinds of
knowledge are like eight judges. The thirty-seven states partaking of
enlightenment are like the ancient royal custom. Herein, just as the
king conforms by saying "So be it" both to the judges' pronouncements
and to the royal custom, so this conformity, which arises contingent
upon formations through \[comprehending\] impermanence, etc., conforms
to the function of truth both in the eight kinds of knowledge and in the
thirty-seven states partaking of enlightenment that follow. Hence it is
called "knowledge in conformity with truth." \[671\]



Knowledge of conformity is ended.



[134.] Though this conformity knowledge is the end of the
insight leading to emergence that has formations as its object, still
change-of-lineage knowledge is the last of all the kinds of insight
leading to emergence.



\[SUTTA  REFERENCES\]



[135.] Now, the following sutta references should be understood
in order not to be confused about insight leading to emergence. For this
insight leading to emergence is called "aloofness" (*atammayatā*)43 in
the Saḷāyatana-vibhaṅga Sutta thus, "Bhikkhus, by depending and relying
on aloofness abandon, surmount, equanimity that is unified, based on
unity" (M III 220). In the Alagadda Sutta it



43\. "Aloofness"---*atammayatā*: not in PED. See also M III 43. The word
is made up of *a + taṃ + maya + tā* = "not-made-of-that-ness." Its
meaning is non-attachment to any\
form of being.

is called "dispassion" (*nibbidā*) thus, "Being dispassionate his greed
fades away. With the fading away of greed he is liberated" (M I 139).



In the Susīma Sutta it is called "knowledge of the relationship of
states" (*dhammaṭṭhiti-ñāṇa*) thus, "Previously, Susīma, there is
knowledge of relationship of states; subsequently there is knowledge of
Nibbāna" (S II 124). In the Poṭṭhapāda Sutta it is called the
"culmination of perception" (*saññagga*) thus, "First, Poṭṭhapāda, the
culmination of perception arises, and afterwards knowledge" (D I 185).
In the Dasuttara Sutta it is called the "principal factor of purity"
(*parisuddhi-padhāniyaṅga*) thus, "Purification by knowledge and vision
of the way is the principal factor of purity" (D III 288).



In the Paṭisambhidāmagga it is called by the three names thus, "Desire
for deliverance, and contemplation of reflection, and equanimity about
formations: these things are one in meaning and only the letter is
different" (Paṭis II 64). In the Paṭṭhāna it is called by two names
thus, "conformity to change-of-lineage" and "conformity to cleansing"44
(Paṭṭh 1, 159).



In the Rathavinīta Sutta it is called "purification by knowledge and
vision of the way" thus, "But how, friend, is it for the purpose of the
purification by knowledge and vision of the way that the life of purity
is lived under the Blessed One?" (M I 147).



[136.] The Greatest Sage did thus proclaim This insight stilled
and purified,\
That to emergence leads beside,\
With many a neatly chosen name.\
The round of rebirth's slough of pain\
Is vast and terrible; a man\
Wisely should strive as best he can,\
If he would this emergence gain.

"purifying" in general, in I.143. For its technical Abhidhamma sense

## CHAPTER XXII 


PURIFICATION BY KNOWLEDGE AND VISION



(*Ñāṇadassana-visuddhi-niddesa*)



\[I. CHANGE-OF-LINEAGE, PATHS, AND FRUITS\]



[1.] \[672\] Change-of-lineage knowledge comes next. Its
position is to advert to the path, and so it belongs neither to
purification by knowledge and vision of the way nor to purification by
knowledge and vision, but being intermediate, it is unassignable. Still
it is reckoned as insight because it falls in line with insight.



[2.]Purification by knowledge and vision properly consists in
knowledge of the four paths, that is to say, the path of stream-entry,
the path of once-return, the path of non-return, and the path of
Arahantship.



\[THE  FIRST  PATH---FIRST  NOBLE  PERSON\]



[3.] Herein, nothing further needs to be done by one who wants
to achieve, firstly, the knowledge of the first path. For what he needs
to do has already been done by arousing the insight that ends in
conformity knowledge.



[4.] As soon as conformity knowledge has arisen in him in this
way, and the thick murk that hides the truths has been dispelled by the
respective force peculiar to each of the three kinds of conformity (see
XXI.129f.), then his consciousness no longer enters into or settles down
on or resolves upon any field of formations at all, or clings, cleaves
or clutches on to it, but retreats, retracts and recoils as water does
from a lotus leaf, and every sign as object, every occurrence as object,
appears as an impediment.



[5.] Then, while every sign and occurrence appears to him as an
impediment, when conformity knowledge's repetition has ended,
change-of-lineage knowledge arises in him, which takes as its object the
signless, non- occurrence, non-formation, cessation, Nibbāna,---which
knowledge passes out of the lineage, the category, the plane, of the
ordinary man and enters the lineage, the category, the plane, of the
Noble Ones,---which, being the first adverting, the first concern, the
first reaction, to Nibbāna as object, fulfils the state of a condition
for the path in six ways, as proximity, \[673\] contiguity, repetition,
decisive-support, absence, and disappearance conditions,---which is the
culminating peak of insight,---which is irrevocable,---of which it is
said:


[]



[]



"How is it that understanding of emergence and turning away from the



external1 is change-of-lineage knowledge?



"It overcomes arising, thus it is change-of-lineage. It overcomes
occurrence ... \[the sign ... accumulation ... rebirth-linking ...
destiny ... generation ... re- arising ... birth ... ageing ... sickness
... death ... sorrow ... lamentation ... \]. It overcomes despair, thus
it is change-of-lineage. It overcomes the sign of formations externally,
thus it is change-of-lineage.



"It enters into2 non-arising, thus it is change-of-lineage. It enters
into non- occurrence, thus it is change-of-lineage ... (etc.) ... It
enters into non-despair, thus it is change-of-lineage. It enters into
cessation, Nibbāna, thus it is change- of-lineage.



"Having overcome arising, it enters into non-arising, thus it is
change-of-



lineage ..." (Paṭis I 56) and so on, all of which should be quoted.



[6.]Here is a simile that illustrates how conformity and
change-of-lineage occur with different objects though occurring in a
single cognitive series with a single adverting. Suppose a man wanted to
leap across a broad stream and establish himself on the opposite bank,
he would run fast, and seizing a rope fastened to the branch of a tree
on the stream's near bank and hanging down, or a pole, he would leap
with his body tending, inclining and leaning towards the opposite bank,
and when he had arrived above the opposite bank, he would let go, fall
on to the opposite bank, staggering first and then steady himself there;
so too this meditator, who wants to establish himself on Nibbāna, the
bank opposite to the kinds of becoming, generation, destiny, station,
and abode, runs fast by means of the contemplation of rise and fall,
etc., and seizing with conformity's adverting to impermanence, pain or
not-self the rope of materiality fastened to the branch of his selfhood
and hanging down, or one among the poles beginning with feeling, he
leaps with the first conformity consciousness without letting go and
with the second he tends, inclines and leans towards Nibbāna, like the
body that was tending, inclining and leaning towards the opposite bank;
then, being with the third next to Nibbāna, which is now attainable,
like the other's arriving above the opposite bank, he lets go that
information as object with the ceasing of that consciousness, and with
the change-of-lineage consciousness he falls on to the unformed Nibbāna,
the bank opposite; but staggering, as the man did, for lack of
\[previous\] repetition, he is not yet properly steady on the single
object. After that he is steadied by path knowledge.



1\. "'*Of emerging and turning away from the external*': it is the
understanding of turning away that is being effected, which turning away
is emergence from the field of formations; it is termed external because
the unformed element's existence is external" (Vism-mhṭ 866). The
unformed element (=Nibbāna) is classed as "external" under\
the internal (*ajjhattika*) triad of the *Abhidhamma Mātikā* (see Dhs 2
and p. 241).



2\. *Pakkhandati*---"enters into is glossed there by *anupavisati*
(enters in Vism-mhṭ (p. 566), which is the sense required and may be
taken as based on the idiom in the Suttas, "*Cittaṃ pakkhandati pasīdati
santiṭṭhati adhimuccati*---the mind enters into \[that\], becomes
settled, steady and resolute" (M I 186), which is obviously
inappropriate here.



[]



[]



[7.]Herein, conformity is able to dispel the murk of
defilements that conceals the truths, but is unable to make Nibbāna its
object. Change-of-lineage is only able to make Nibbāna its object, but
it is unable to dispel the murk that conceals the truths.



[8.]Here is a simile: \[674\] A man with eyes went out at
night, it seems, to find out the conjunction of the stars, and he looked
up to see the moon. It was invisible because it was concealed by clouds.
Then a wind sprang up and blew away the thick clouds; another blew away
the medium clouds; and another blew away the fine clouds as well. Then
the man saw the moon in the sky free from clouds, and he found out the
conjunction of the stars.



[9.]Herein, the thick, medium and fine kinds of darkness that
conceal the truths are like the three kinds of cloud. The three kinds of
conformity consciousness are like the three winds. Change-of-lineage
knowledge is like the man with eyes. Nibbāna is like the moon. The
dispelling of the murk that conceals the truths by each kind of
conformity consciousness is like the successive blowing away of the
clouds by each wind. Change-of-lineage knowledge's seeing the clear
Nibbāna when the murk that concealed the truths has disappeared is like
the man's seeing the clear moon in the sky free from cloud.



[10.]Just as the three winds are able only to blow away the
clouds that conceal the moon but cannot see the moon, so the three kinds
of conformity are able only to dispel the murk that conceals the truths
but cannot see Nibbāna. Just as the man can only see the moon but cannot
blow away the clouds, so change-of- lineage knowledge can only see
Nibbāna but cannot dispel the defilements. Hence it is called "adverting
to the path."



[11.]For although it is not adverting, it occupies the position
of adverting; and then, after, as it were, giving a sign to the path to
come into being, it ceases. And without pausing after the sign given by
that the change-of-lineage knowledge, the path follows upon it in
uninterrupted continuity, and as it comes into being it pierces and
explodes the mass of greed, the mass of hate, and the mass of delusion
never pierced and exploded before (cf. Paṭis II 20).



[12.]Here is a simile for this. An archer, it seems, had a
target3 set up at a distance of eight *usabhas* (about 100 yards), and
wrapping his face in a cloth and arming himself with an arrow, he stood
on a wheel contrivance (a revolving platform). Another man turned the
wheel contrivance, and when the target was opposite the archer, he gave
him a sign with a stick. Without pausing after the sign the archer shot
the arrow and hit the target.



[13.]Herein, change-of-lineage knowledge is like the sign with
the stick. Path knowledge is like the archer. Path knowledge's \[675\]
making Nibbāna its object without pausing after the sign given by
change-of-lineage, and its piercing and exploding the mass of greed,
hate and delusion never pierced and exploded before, is like the
archer's hitting the target without pausing after the sign.



3\. *Phalakasataṃ---*"target": not in PED. Vism-mhṭ says "*Phalakasatan
ti asana-sāra-* *mayaṃ phalakasataṃ---*a "*phalakasata*" is one made of
the heart (pith) of the *asana* tree." The "wheel contrivance" resembles
a potter's wheel according to Vism-mhṭ (p.867).



[]



[]



[14.]And not only does it cause the piercing of this mass of
greed, etc., but it also dries up the ocean of suffering of the round in
the beginningless round of rebirths. It closes all doors to the states
of loss. It provides actual experience of the seven noble treasures.4 It
abandons the eightfold wrong path. It allays all enmity and fear.5 It
leads to the state of the Fully Enlightened One's breast-born son (see S
II 221). And it leads to the acquisition of many hundred other
blessings. So it is the knowledge associated with the path of
stream-entry, the provider of many hundred blessings, that is called
knowledge of the path of stream-entry.



The first kind of knowledge is ended.



\[THE FIRST FRUITION---SECOND NOBLE PERSON\]



[15.]Immediately next to that knowledge, however, there arise
either two or three fruition consciousnesses, which are its result. For
it is owing to this very fact that supramundane profitable
\[consciousness\] results immediately that it is said, "And which he
called the concentration with immediate result" (Sn 226), and
"Sluggishly he reaches what has immediate result for the destruction of
the cankers" (A II 149), and so on.



[16.] Some, however, say that there are one, two, three, four,
or five fruition consciousnesses. That is inadmissible. For
change-of-lineage knowledge arises at the end of conformity's
repetition, so at the minimum there must be two conformity
consciousnesses, since one alone does not act as repetition condition.
And a single series of impulsions has a maximum of seven \[impulsion\]
consciousnesses. Consequently, that series which has two conformities
and change-of-lineage as a third and path consciousness as fourth has
three fruition consciousnesses. That which has three conformities and
change-of-lineage as fourth and path consciousness as fifth has two
fruition consciousnesses. That is why it was said above, "There arise
either two or three fruition consciousnesses."



[17.]Then some say that which has four conformities and
change-of-lineage as fifth and path consciousness as sixth has one
fruition consciousness. But that is refuted because it is the fourth or
fifth \[impulsion\] that reaches \[the path\], not those after that,
owing to their nearness to the life-continuum (see IV.75). So that
cannot be accepted as correct. \[676\]



[18.] And at this point this stream-enterer is called the
second noble person. However negligent he may be, he is bound to make an
end of suffering when he has travelled and traversed the round of
rebirths among deities and human beings for the seventh time.



[19.]At the end of the fruition his consciousness enters the
life-continuum. After that, it arises as mind-door adverting
interrupting the life-continuum for the purpose of reviewing the path.
When that has ceased, seven impulsions of path reviewing



4\. The seven (noble) treasures are: faith, virtue, conscience, shame,
learning, generosity, and understanding (D III 251).\



5\. See the five kinds of enmity and fear at S II 68f. Vism-mhṭ,
however, says: "The five kinds of enmity beginning with killing living
things and the twenty-five great terrors (*mahā-bhayāni*) are what
constitute '*all enmity and fear*'" (Vism-mhṭ 867).

arise. After re-entry into the life-continuum, adverting, etc., arise
again in the same way for the purpose of reviewing fruition, and so on.
With the arising of these he reviews the path, he reviews the fruition,
he reviews the defilements abandoned, he reviews the defilements still
remaining, and he reviews Nibbāna.



[20.]He reviews the path in this way, "So this is the path I
have come by." Next he reviews the fruition after that in this way,
"This is the blessing I have obtained." Next he reviews the defilements
that have been abandoned, "These are the defilements abandoned in me."
Next he reviews the defilements still to be eliminated by the three
higher paths, "These are the defilements still remaining in me." And
lastly he reviews the deathless Nibbāna in this way, "This is the state
(*dhamma*) that has been penetrated by me as object." So the noble
disciple who is a stream-enterer has five kinds of reviewing.



[21.]And as in the case of the stream-enterer, so also in the
cases of the once- returner and non-returner. But the Arahant has no
reviewing of remaining defilements. So all the kinds of reviewing total
nineteen. This is the maximum number. Trainers may or may not have the
reviewing of the defilements abandoned and those still remaining. In
fact it was owing to the absence of such reviewing that Mahānāma asked
the Blessed One, "What state is there still unabandoned by me internally
owing to which at times states of greed invade my mind and remain?" (M I
91) all of which should be quoted.



\[THE SECOND PATH---THIRD NOBLE PERSON\]



[22.]However, after reviewing in this way, either while sitting
in the same session or on another occasion, the noble disciple who is a
stream-enterer makes it his task to reach the second plane by
attenuating both greed for sense desires and ill-will. He brings to bear
the faculties,6 the powers, and the enlightenment factors, and he works
over and turns up that same field of formations, classed as materiality,
feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness, with the knowledge
that they are impermanent, painful, not-self, and he embarks upon the
progressive series of insights.



[23.] When he has \[677\] done so, and when, at the end of
equanimity about



formations, conformity and change-of-lineage7 knowledge have arisen in a
single



6\. For the use of the expression "brings to bear"---*samodhāneti* in
this sense see Paṭis I 181.\



7\. "Here '*change-of-lineage*' means 'like change-of-lineage'; for the
knowledge that ushers in the \[first\] path is called that in the
literal sense because it overcomes the ordinary man's lineage and
develops the Noble One's lineage. But this is called 'change-of-lineage'
figuratively because of its similarity to the other. It is also called
'cleansing' (*vodāna*) because it purifies from certain defilements and
because it makes absolute purification its object. Hence it is said in
the Paṭṭhāna, 'Conformity is a condition, as proximity condition, for
cleansing' (Paṭṭh I 59). But '*next to change-of-lineage*' is said here
because it is said in the Paṭisambhidāmagga that for the purpose of
'overcoming arising,' etc., 'eight states of change-of-lineage arise
through concentration' and 'ten states of change-of-lineage arise
through concentration' and 'ten states of change-of-lineage arise
through insight' (Paṭis I 68--69), and it is given in the same way in
this page" (Vism-mhṭ 869).



[]



[]



adverting in the way already described, then the path of once-return
arises next to change-of-lineage. The knowledge associated with that is
knowledge of the path of once-return.



The second kind of knowledge is ended.



\[THE SECOND FRUITION---FOURTH NOBLE PERSON\]



[24.] The fruition consciousness should be understood to follow
immediately upon this knowledge in the same way as before. And at this
point this once- returner is called the fourth noble person. He is bound
to make an end of suffering after returning once to this world. Next
there comes reviewing in the way already described.



\[THE THIRD PATH---FIFTH NOBLE PERSON\]



[25.]Now, after reviewing in this way, either while sitting in
the same session or on another occasion, this noble disciple who is a
once-returner makes it his task to reach the third plane by abandoning,
without remainder, both greed for the sense desires and ill-will. He
brings to bear the faculties, the powers, and the enlightenment factors,
and he works over and turns up that same field of formations with the
knowledge that they are impermanent, painful, not-self, and he embarks
upon the progressive series of insights.



[26.]When he has done so, and when, at the end of equanimity
about formations, conformity and change-of-lineage have arisen in a
single adverting in the way already described, then the path of
non-return arises next to change-of-lineage. The knowledge associated
with that is knowledge of the path of non-return.



The third kind of knowledge is ended.



\[THE THIRD FRUITION---SIXTH NOBLE PERSON\]



[27.]The fruition consciousnesses should be understood to
follow immediately upon this knowledge in the same way as before. And at
this point this non- returner is called the sixth noble person. \[After
death\] he reappears apparitionally \[elsewhere\] and attains complete
extinction there without ever returning, without ever coming to this
world again through rebirth-linking. Next there comes reviewing in the
way already described.



\[THE  FOURTH  PATH---SEVENTH  NOBLE  PERSON\]



[28.]Now, after reviewing in this way, either while sitting in
the same session or on another occasion, this noble disciple who is a
non-returner makes it his task to reach the fourth plane by abandoning,
without remainder, greed for the fine- material and immaterial, conceit
(pride), agitation, and ignorance. He brings to bear the faculties, the
powers, and the enlightenment factors, and he works over \[678\] and
turns up that same field of formations with the knowledge that they are
impermanent, painful, not-self, and he embarks upon the progressive
series of insights.



[29.]When he has done so, and when, at the end of equanimity
about formations, conformity and change-of-lineage have arisen in a
single adverting, then the



[]



[]



path of Arahantship arises next to change-of-lineage. The knowledge
associated with that is knowledge of the path of Arahantship.



The fourth kind of knowledge is ended.



\[THE FOURTH FRUITION---EIGHTH NOBLE PERSON\]



[30.] The fruition consciousness should be understood to follow
immediately upon this knowledge in the same way as before. And at this
point this Arahant is called the eighth noble person. He is one of the
Great Ones with cankers destroyed, he bears this last body, he has laid
down the burden, reached his goal and destroyed the fetter of becoming,
he is rightly liberated with \[final\] knowledge and worthy of the
highest offering of the world with its deities.



[31.]So when it was said above, "However, purification by
knowledge and vision properly consists in knowledge of the four paths,
that is to say, the path of stream-entry, the path of once-return, the
path of non-return, and the path of Arahantship" (§2), that referred to
these four kinds of knowledge to be reached in this order.



\[II. THE STATES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PATH, ETC.\]



[32.]Now, in order to appreciate the value of this same
purification by knowledge and vision with its four kinds of knowledge:



\(1\)



fulfilment of states sharing in enlightenment,



\(2\)



Emergence, and (3) the coupling of the powers,



\(4\)



The kinds of states that ought to be abandoned,



\(5\)



Also the act of their abandoning,



\(6\)



Functions of full-understanding, and the rest



As stated when truths are penetrated to,



\(7\)



Each one of which ought to be recognized



According to its individual essence.



[33.] *1.* Herein, the *fulfilment of states sharing in
enlightenment* is the fulfilledness of those states partaking in
enlightenment. For they are the following thirty- seven states: the four
foundations of mindfulness (MN 10), the four right endeavours (M II 11),
the four roads to power (M I 103), the five faculties (M II 12), the
five powers (M II 12), the seven enlightenment factors (M I 11), and the
Noble Eightfold Path (D II 311f.). And they are called "partaking of
enlightenment" because they take the part of the Noble Eightfold Path,
which is called "enlightenment" in the sense of enlightening, and they
"take the part" of that because they are helpful.8



8\. The four foundations of mindfulness are fully commented on in the
commentary to MN 10 (= commentary to DN 22). The right endeavours are
fully commented on in\
the commentary to the Sammappadhāna Vibhaṅga (cf. M-a II 243ff.; also
A-a commenting on AN 1:II 1). The four roads to power are briefly
commented on at M-a II 69 and fully in the commentary to the M-a I 82f.
and more fully in the commentary to the Bojjhaṅga Vibhaṅga. The Noble
Eightfold Path is commented on at M-a I 105



[]



[]



[34.]"Foundation" (*paṭṭhāna*) is because of establishment
(*upaṭṭhāna*) by going down into, by descending upon, such and such
objects.9 Mindfulness itself as foundation (establishment) is
"foundation of mindfulness." It is of four kinds because it occurs with
respect to the body, feeling, consciousness, and mental objects
(*dhamma*), taking them as foul, painful, impermanent, and non-self, and
because it accomplishes the function of abandoning perception of beauty,
pleasure, permanence, and self. \[679\] That is why "four foundations of
mindfulness" is said.



[35.] By it they endeavour (*padahanti*), thus it is endeavour
(*padhāna*); a good endeavour is a right (*sammā*) endeavour. Or
alternatively: by its means people endeavour rightly (*sammā
padahanti*), thus it is right endeavour (*sammappa- dhāna*). Or
alternatively: it is good because of abandoning the unseemliness of
defilement, and it is endeavour because of bringing about improvement
and giving precedence (*padhāna-bhāva-kāraṇa*) in the sense of producing
well-being and bliss, thus it is right endeavour. It is a name for
energy. It accomplishes the functions of abandoning arisen unprofitable
things, preventing the arising of those not yet arisen, arousing
unarisen profitable things, and maintaining those already arisen; thus
it is fourfold. That is why "four right endeavours" is said.



[36.]Power (*iddhi*) is in the sense of success (*ijjhana*) as
already described (XII.44). It is the road (basis---*pāda*) to that
power (for that success---*iddhi*) in the sense of being the precursor
of that success which is associated with it and in the sense of being
the prior cause of that success which is its fruit, thus it is a road to
power (basis for success). It is fourfold as zeal (desire), and so on.
That is why "four roads to power" are spoken of, according as it is
said: "Four roads to power: the road to power consisting in zeal, the
road to power consisting in energy, the road to power consisting in
\[natural purity of\] consciousness, the road to power consisting in
inquiry" (Vibh 223). These are supramundane only. But because of the
words "If a bhikkhu obtains concentration, obtains mental unification by
making zeal predominant, this is called concentration through zeal"
(Vibh 216), etc., they are also mundane as states acquired by
predominance of zeal, etc., respectively.



[37.]"Faculty" is in the sense of predominance, in other words,
of overcoming, because \[these states, as faculties\] respectively
overcome faithlessness, idleness, negligence, distraction, and
confusion.



"Power" is in the sense of unwaveringness because \[these states, as
powers\] are incapable of being overcome respectively by faithlessness,
and so on. Both are fivefold as consisting in faith, \[energy,
mindfulness, concentration, and understanding\]. That is why "five
faculties" and "five powers" is said.



and from a different angle in the commentary to the Magga Vibhaṅga. The
five faculties and the five powers are not apparently dealt with in the
Nikāya and the Abhidhamma Commentaries by adding anything further to
what is said here (§37).



9\. The Paṭisambhidā (Paṭis I 177) derives *satipaṭṭhāna* from *sati*
(mindfulness) and *paṭṭhāna* (foundation, establishment). The
commentaries prefer to derive it from *sati* and *upaṭṭhāna*
(establishment, appearance, and also waiting upon: see M-a I 238). The
readings of the Ee and Ae eds. disagree here and that of the former has
been followed though the result is much the same.



[]



[]



[38.] Mindfulness, \[investigation-of-states, energy,
happiness, tranquillity concentration, and equanimity,\] as factors in a
being who is becoming enlightened, are the "seven enlightenment
factors." And right view, \[right thinking, right speech, right action,
right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right
concentration,\] are the eight "path factors" in the sense of being an
outlet. Hence, "seven enlightenment factors" and "the Noble Eightfold
Path" is said.



[39.]So there are these thirty-seven states partaking of
enlightenment.



Now, in the prior stage when mundane insight is occurring, they are
found in a plurality of consciousnesses as follows: the foundation of
mindfulness consisting in contemplation of the body \[is found\] in one
discerning the body in the fourteen ways;10 the foundation of
mindfulness consisting in contemplation of feeling, in one discerning
feeling in the nine ways; the foundation of mindfulness consisting in
the contemplation of mind, in one discerning the \[manner of\]
consciousness in sixteen ways; \[680\] the foundation of mindfulness
consisting in contemplation of mental objects, in one discerning mental
objects in the five ways. And at the time when, on seeing an
unprofitable state arisen in someone else, which has not yet arisen in
his own person, he strives for its non-arising thus, "I shall not behave
as he has done in whom this is now arisen, and so this will not arise in
me," then he has the first right endeavour; when, seeing something
unprofitable in his own behaviour, he strives to abandon it, then he has
the second; when he strives to arouse jhāna or insight so far unarisen
in this person, he has the third; and when he arouses again and again
what has already arisen so that it shall not diminish, he has the
fourth. And at the time of arousing a profitable state with zeal as the
motive force, there is the road to power consisting in zeal, \[and so on
with the remaining three roads to power\]. And at the time of abstaining
from wrong speech there is right speech, \[and so on with abstaining
from wrong action and wrong livelihood\].11



At the time of arising of \[any one of\] the four kinds of \[path\]
knowledge, \[all these states\] are found in a single consciousness. In
the moment of fruition the thirty-three excepting the four right
endeavours are found.



10\. These figures refer to the numbers of different contemplations
described in the tenth sutta of the Majjhima Nikāya (= DN 22).\



11\. These three abstinences are the "prior state" of the Eightfold Path
(see M III 289). "Only the road to power consisting in zeal, and right
speech, are actually included here; but when these are mentioned, the
remaining roads to power and remaining two abstinences are implied in
the meaning too. The meaning of this sentence should be understood
according to the 'category of characteristics' (*lakkhaṇa-hāra*---see
Nettipakaraṇa)" (Vism-mhṭ 872). This Netti rule says:\
"When one thing has been stated, then those things\
That are in characteristic one with it\
Are stated too--this is the formulation\
Of the category of characteristics" (Netti 3).



[]



[]



[40.]When these are found in a single consciousness in this
way, it is the one kind of mindfulness whose object is Nibbāna that is
called "the four foundations of mindfulness" because it accomplishes the
function of abandoning the \[four\] perceptions of beauty, etc., in the
\[four things\] beginning with the body. And also the one kind of energy
is called "four right endeavours" because it accomplishes the \[four\]
functions beginning with preventing the arising of the unarisen
\[unprofitable\]. But there is no decrease or increase with the rest.



[41.]Furthermore it is said of them:



Nine in one way, one in two ways,\
Then in four ways, and in five ways,\
In eight ways, and in nine ways, too---\
So in six ways they come to be.



[42.](i) *Nine in one way*: these nine are zeal, consciousness,
happiness, tranquillity, equanimity, thinking, speech, action, and
livelihood, and they are found "in one way" as road to power consisting
in zeal, etc., since they do not belong to any other group. (ii) *One in
two ways*: faith is found "in two ways," as a faculty and as a power.
(iii) *Then in four ways, and* (iv) *in five ways*: the meaning is that
another one is found in four ways and another in five. Herein,
concentration is the "one in four ways" since it is a faculty, a power,
an enlightenment factor, and a path factor; understanding is the "one in
five ways" since it is these four and also a road to power. (v) *In
eight ways, and* (vi) *in nine ways, too*: the meaning is that another
one is found in eight ways and another in nine ways. Mindfulness is one
"in eight ways" since it is the four foundations of mindfulness, a
faculty, a power, an enlightenment factor, and a path factor; energy is
the one "in nine ways" since it is four right endeavours, a road to
power, a faculty, a power, an enlightenment factor, and a path factor.
\[681\] So:



[43.] States sharing in enlightenment Are fourteen,
undistributed;\
They total thirty-seven states\
Among the groups distributed.



While each performs the proper task\
That to its special lot falls due,\
They all come into being when\
The Noble Eightfold Path comes true.



This is how, firstly, the "fulfilment of states partaking in
enlightenment" should



be understood here.



[44.] *2.* *Emergence* and  *3. coupling of the powers*: the
resolution of the compound



*vuṭṭhānabalasamāyoga* is *vuṭṭhānañ c'eva bala-samāyogo ca*.



\[*2.* *Emergence*:\] mundane insight induces no emergence either from
occurrence \[of defilement internally\], because it does not cut off
originating, which is the act of causing occurrence,12 or from the sign
\[of formations externally\], because it has the sign as object.



12\. "Emergence from the sign consists in relinquishing the sign of
formations and making Nibbāna the object. Emergence from occurrence
consists in entering upon



[]



[]



Change-of-lineage knowledge does not induce emergence from occurrence
\[internally\] because it does not cut off originating, but it does
induce emergence from the sign \[externally\] because it has Nibbāna as
its object; so there is emergence from one. Hence it is said,
"Understanding of emergence and turning away from the external is
knowledge of change-of-lineage" (Paṭis I 66). Likewise the whole
passage, "Having turned away from arising, it enters into non-arising,
thus it is change-of-lineage. Having turned away from occurrence ...
(etc.---for elision see Ch. XXI.37) ... \[Having turned away from the
sign of formations externally, it enters into cessation, Nibbāna, thus
it is change-of-lineage\]" (Paṭis I 67), should be understood here.



These four kinds of \[path\] knowledge emerge from the sign because they
have the signless as their object, and also from occurrence because they
cut off origination. So they emerge from both. Hence it is said:



[45.]"How is it that understanding of emergence and turning
away from both is knowledge of the path?



"At the moment of the stream-entry path, right view in the sense of
seeing (a) emerges from wrong view, and it emerges from defilements and
from the aggregates that occur consequent upon that \[wrong view\],13
and (b) externally it emerges from all signs; hence it was said:
Understanding of emergence and turning away from both is knowledge of
the path. Right thinking in the sense of directing emerges from wrong
thinking ... Right speech in the sense of embracing emerges from wrong
speech ... Right action in the sense of originating emerges from wrong
action ... Right livelihood in the sense of cleansing emerges from wrong
livelihood ... Right effort in the sense of exerting emerges from wrong
effort ... Right mindfulness in the sense of establishment emerges from
wrong mindfulness ... Right concentration in the sense of
non-distraction emerges from wrong concentration and it emerges from
defilements and from the aggregates that occur consequent upon that
\[wrong concentration\], and externally it emerges from all signs; hence
it was said: Understanding of emergence and turning away from both is
knowledge of the path.



"At the moment of the once-return path, right view in the sense of
seeing ... Right concentration in the sense of non-distraction (a)
emerges from the gross fetter of greed for sense desires, from the gross
fetter of resentment, from the gross inherent tendency to greed for
sense desires, and from the gross inherent tendency to resentment, \[and
it emerges from defilements and from the aggregates consequent upon
that, and (b) externally it emerges from all signs; hence it was said:
Understanding of emergence and turning away from both is knowledge of
the path\].



"At the moment of the non-return path, right view in the sense of seeing
...



Right concentration in the sense of non-distraction (a) emerges \[682\]
from the



the state of non-liability to the occurrence of kamma-result in the
future by causing the cessation of cause" (Vism-mhṭ 874).\



13\. "It emerges from the defilements of uncertainty, etc., that occur
consequent upon that view, which is wrong since it leads to states of
loss" (Vism-mhṭ 874).



[]



[]



residual fetter of greed for sense desires, from the residual fetter of
resentment, from the residual inherent tendency to greed for sense
desires, from the residual inherent tendency to resentment, \[and it
emerges from defilements and from the aggregates that occur consequent
upon that, and (b) externally it emerges from all signs; hence it was
said: Understanding of emergence and turning away from both is knowledge
of the path\].



"At the moment of the Arahant path, right view in the sense of seeing
... Right concentration in the sense of non-distraction (a) emerges from
greed for the fine-material \[existence\], from greed for immaterial
\[existence\], from conceit (pride), from agitation, from ignorance,
from the inherent tendency to conceit (pride), from the inherent
tendency to greed for becoming, from the inherent tendency to ignorance,
and it emerges from defilements and from the aggregates that occur
consequent upon that, and (b) externally it emerges from all signs;
hence it was said: Understanding of emergence and turning away from both
is knowledge of the path" (Paṭis I 69f.).



[46.] \[*3.*  *Coupling of the powers*:\] At the time of
developing the eight mundane attainments the serenity power is in
excess, while at the time of developing the contemplations of
impermanence, etc., the insight power is in excess. But at the noble
path moment they occur coupled together in the sense that neither one
exceeds the other. So there is coupling of the powers in the case of
each one of these four kinds of knowledge, according as it is said:
"When he emerges from the defilements associated with agitation, and
from the aggregates, his mental unification, non-distraction,
concentration, has cessation as its domain. When he emerges from the
defilements associated with ignorance and from the aggregates, his
insight in the sense of contemplation has cessation as its domain. So
serenity and insight have a single nature in the sense of emergence,
they are coupled together, and neither exceeds the other. Hence it was
said: He develops serenity and insight coupled together in the sense of
emergence" (Paṭis II 98).



"Emergence" and "coupling of the powers" should be understood here in



this way.



[47.] *4.* *The kinds of states that ought to be abandoned*, 5.
*also the act of their abandoning*: now which states are to be abandoned
by which kind of knowledge among these four should be understood, and
also the act of abandoning them. For they each and severally bring about
the act of abandoning of the states called fetters, defilements,
wrongnesses, worldly states, kinds of avarice, perversions, ties, bad
ways, cankers, floods, bonds, hindrances, adherences, clingings,
inherent tendencies, stains, unprofitable courses of action, and
unprofitable thought- arisings.



[48.]Herein, the *fetters* are the ten states beginning with
greed for the fine material, so called because they fetter aggregates
\[in this life\] to aggregates \[of the next\], or kamma to its fruit,
or beings to suffering. For as long as those exist there is no cessation
of the others. And of these fetters, greed for the fine material, greed
for the immaterial, conceit (pride), agitation, and ignorance are called
the five higher fetters because they fetter beings to aggregates, etc.,
produced in higher \[forms of becoming\], \[683\] while false view of
individuality, uncertainty, adherence to



[]



[]



rules and vows, greed for sense desires, and resentment are called the
five lower fetters because they fetter beings to aggregates, etc.,
produced in the lower \[forms of becoming\].



[49.] The  *defilements* are the ten states, namely, greed,
hate, delusion, conceit (pride), \[false\] view, uncertainty, stiffness
\[of mind\], agitation, consciencelessness, shamelessness. They are so
called because they are themselves defiled and because they defile their
associated states.



[50.]The  *wrongnesses* are the eight states, namely, wrong
view, wrong thinking, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood,
wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, wrong concentration, which with wrong
knowledge and wrong deliverance,14 come to ten. They are so called
because they occur wrongly.



[51.]The *worldly states* are the eight, namely, gain, loss,
fame, disgrace, pleasure, pain, blame, and praise. They are so called
because they continually succeed each other as long as the world
persists. But when the worldly states are included, then by the
metaphorical use of the cause's name \[for its fruit\], the approval
that has the gain, etc., as its object and the resentment that has the
loss, etc., as its object should also be understood as included.



[52.]The  *kinds of avarice* are the five, namely, avarice
about dwellings, families, gain, Dhamma, and praise, which occur as
inability to bear sharing with others any of these things beginning with
dwellings.



[53.] The  *perversions* are the three, namely, perversions of
perception, of consciousness, and of view, which occur apprehending
objects that are impermanent, painful, not-self, and foul (ugly), as
permanent, pleasant, self, and beautiful.



[54.]The  *ties* are the four beginning with covetousness, so
called because they tie the mental body and the material body. They are
described as "the bodily tie of covetousness, the bodily tie of ill
will, the bodily tie of adherence to rules and vows, and the bodily tie
of insisting (misinterpreting) that 'This \[only\] is the truth'" (Vibh
374).



[55.] *Bad ways* is a term for doing what ought not to be done
and not doing what ought to be done, out of zeal (desire), hate,
delusion, and fear. They are called "bad ways" because they are ways not
to be travelled by Noble Ones.



[56.] *Cankers * (*āsava*): as far as (*ā*) change-of-lineage
\[in the case of states of consciousness\] and as far as (*ā*) the acme
of becoming \[in the case of the kinds of becoming, that is to say, the
fourth immaterial state,\] there are exudations (*savana*) owing to the
\[formed nature of the\] object. This is a term for greed for sense
desires, greed for becoming, wrong view, and ignorance, because of the
exuding (*savana*) \[of these defilements\] from unguarded sense-doors
like water from cracks



14\. "'*Wrong knowledge*,' which is wrong because it does not occur
rightly \[i.e. in conformity with the truth\], and is wrong and mistaken
owing to misinterpretations, etc., is just delusion. '*Wrong
deliverance*' is the wrong notion of liberation that assumes liberation
to take place in a 'World Apex' (*lokathūpika--*see XVI.85), and so on"
(Vism-mhṭ 886).

in a pot in the sense of constant trickling, or because of their
producing (*savana*) the suffering of the round of rebirths.15 \[684\]



The  *floods* are so called in the sense of sweeping away into the ocean
of



becoming, and in the sense of being hard to cross.



The  *bonds* are so called because they do not allow disengagement from
an object and disengagement from suffering. Both "floods" and "bonds"
are terms for the cankers already mentioned.



[57.]The *hindrances* are the five, namely, lust, \[ill will,
stiffness and torpor, agitation and worry, and uncertainty,\] in the
sense of obstructing and hindering and concealing \[reality\] from
consciousness (IV.86).



[58.]*Adherence* (*misapprehension---parāmāsa*) is a term for
wrong view, because it occurs in the aspect of missing the individual
essence of a given state (*dhamma*) and apprehending (*āmasana*)
elsewhere (*parato*) an unactual individual essence.



[59.]The  *clingings* are the four beginning with sense-desire
clinging described in all their aspects in the Description of the
Dependent Origination (Ch. XVII.240f.).



[60.]The *inherent tendencies* are the seven, namely, greed for
sense desires, etc., in the sense of the inveterateness, stated thus:
the inherent tendency to greed for sense desires, the inherent tendency
to resentment, conceit (pride), \[false\] view, uncertainty, greed for
becoming, and ignorance. For it is owing to their inveteracy that they
are called inherent tendencies (*anusaya*) since they inhere
(*anusenti*) as cause for the arising of greed for sense desires, etc.,
again and again.



[61.] The  *stains* are the three, namely, greed, hate, and
delusion. They are so called because they are themselves dirty like oil,
black, and mud, and because they dirty other things.



[62.] The  *unprofitable courses of action* are the ten,
namely, killing living things, taking what is not given, sexual
misconduct; false speech, malicious speech, harsh speech, gossip;
covetousness, ill will, and wrong view. They are so called since they
are both unprofitable action (*kamma*) and courses that lead to unhappy
destinies.



[63.]The *unprofitable thought-arisings* are the twelve
consisting of the eight rooted in greed, the two rooted in hate, and the
two rooted in delusion (XIV.89f.).



[64.]So these \[four kinds of knowledge\] each and severally
abandon these states beginning with the fetters. How?



The five states eliminated by the first knowledge in the case of the
*fetters*,



firstly, are: false view of personality, doubt, adherence to rules and
vows, and



15\. The meaning of this paragraph is made clearer by reference to the
*Atthasālinī* (Dhs-a 48) and *Mūla Þīkā* (Dhs-ṭ 51), where the use of
*ā* as an adverb in the sense of "as far as" indirectly with the
ablative (*gotrabhuto*, etc.) is explained; the abl. properly belongs to
*savana* (i.e. exudations from). Vism-mhṭ only says: "'*Exudations*'
(*savana*) because of occurring \[due to\], *savanato* ("*because of
exuding*") is because of flowing out as filth of defilement. *Savanato*
("*because of producing*") the second time is because of giving out
(*pasavana*)" (Vism-mhṭ 876. Cf. also M-a I 61).

then greed for sense desires and resentment that are \[strong enough\]
to lead to states of loss. The remaining gross greed for sense desires
and resentment are eliminated by the second knowledge. Subtle greed for
sense desires and resentment are eliminated by the third knowledge. The
five beginning with greed for the fine material are only \[actually\]
eliminated by the fourth knowledge.



In what follows, we shall not in every instance specify the fact with
the expression "only \[actually\]"; nevertheless, whatever we shall say
is eliminated by one of the \[three\] higher knowledges should be
understood as only the \[residual\] state eliminated by the higher
knowledge; for that state will have already been rendered not conducive
to states of loss by the preceding knowledge.



[65.]In the case of the *defilements*, \[false\] view and
uncertainty are eliminated by the first knowledge. Hate is eliminated by
the third knowledge. Greed, delusion, conceit (pride), mental stiffness,
agitation, consciencelessness, and shameless- ness are eliminated by the
fourth knowledge.



[66.]In the case of the *wrongnesses*, wrong view, false
speech, wrong action, and wrong \[685\] livelihood are eliminated by the
first knowledge. Wrong thinking, malicious speech, and harsh speech are
eliminated by the third knowledge. And here only volition is to be
understood as speech. Gossip, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, wrong
concentration, wrong deliverance, and wrong knowledge are eliminated by
the fourth knowledge.



[67.] In the case of the *worldly states*, resentment is
eliminated by the third knowledge, and approval is eliminated by the
fourth knowledge. Some say that approval of fame and praise is
eliminated by the fourth knowledge.



The *kinds of avarice* are eliminated by the first knowledge only.



[68.]In the case of the *perversions*, the perversions of
perception, consciousness, and view, which find permanence in the
impermanent and self in the not-self, and the perversion of view finding
pleasure in pain and beauty in the foul, are eliminated by the first
knowledge. The perversions of perception and consciousness finding
beauty in the foul are eliminated by the third path. The perversions of
perception and consciousness finding pleasure in the painful are
eliminated by the fourth knowledge.



[69.]In the case of *ties*, the bodily ties of adherence to
rules and vows and of the insistence (misinterpretation) that "This is
the truth" are eliminated by the first knowledge. The bodily tie of ill
will is eliminated by the third knowledge. The remaining one is
eliminated by the fourth path.



The *bad ways* are eliminated by the first knowledge only.



[70.] In the case of the *cankers*, the canker of view is
eliminated by the first knowledge. The canker of sense desire is
eliminated by the third knowledge. The other two are eliminated by the
fourth knowledge.



The same thing applies in the case of the *floods* and the *bonds*.



[71.]In the case of the *hindrances*, the hindrance of
uncertainty is eliminated by the first knowledge. The three, namely,
lust, ill will, and worry, are eliminated by



[]



[]



the third knowledge. Stiffness and torpor and agitation are eliminated
by the fourth knowledge.



*Adherence* is eliminated by the first knowledge only.



[72.]In the case of the *clingings*, since according to what is
given in the texts all worldly states are sense desires, that is, sense
desires as object (see Nidd I 1--2), and so greed both for the fine
material and the immaterial falls under sense- desire clinging,
consequently that sense-desire clinging is eliminated by the fourth
knowledge. The rest are eliminated by the first knowledge.



[73.]In the case of the *inherent tendencies*, the inherent
tendencies to \[false\] view and to uncertainty are eliminated by the
first knowledge. The inherent tendencies to greed for sense desires and
to resentment are eliminated by the third knowledge. The inherent
tendencies to conceit (pride), to greed for becoming, and to ignorance
are eliminated by the fourth knowledge.



[74.]In the case of the *stains*, the stain of hate is
eliminated by the third knowledge, the others are eliminated by the
fourth knowledge.



[75.]In the case of the *unprofitable courses of action*,
killing living things, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct,
false speech, and wrong view are eliminated by the first knowledge. The
three, namely, malicious speech, harsh speech, and ill will, are
eliminated by the third knowledge. Gossip and covetousness are
eliminated by the fourth knowledge.



[76.]In the case of the *unprofitable thought-arisings*, the
four associated with \[false\] view, and that associated with
uncertainty, making five, are eliminated by the first knowledge. The two
associated with resentment are eliminated by the third knowledge. The
rest are eliminated by the fourth knowledge.



[77.]And what is eliminated by any one of them is abandoned by
it. That is why it was said above, "So these \[four kinds of knowledge\]
each and severally abandon these states beginning with the fetters."



[78.] *5.* *The act of the abandoning*: but how then? Do these
\[knowledges\] abandon these states when they are past, or when they are
future, or when \[686\] they are present? What is the position here?
For, firstly, if \[they are said to abandon them\] when past or future,
it follows that the effort is fruitless. Why? Because what has to be
abandoned is non-existent. Then if it is when they are present, it is
likewise fruitless because the things to be abandoned exist
simultaneously with the effort, and it follows that there is development
of a path that has defilement, or it follows that defilements are
dissociated \[from consciousness\] though there is no such thing as a
present defilement dissociated from consciousness.16



16\. "The intention is: or it follows that there is dissociation of
defilements from consciousness, like that of formations according to
those who assert that formations exist dissociated form consciousness.
He said, 'there is no such thing as a present defilement dissociated
from consciousness' in order to show that that is merely the opinion of
those who make the assertion. For it is when immaterial states are
actually occurring by their having a single basis and being included in
the three instants that they are present; so how could that be
dissociated from consciousness? Consequently there is no dissociation
from consciousness here" (Vism-mhṭ 878).



[]



[]



[79.]That is not an original argument; for in the text first
the question is put: "When a man abandons defilements, does he abandon
past defilements? Does he abandon future defilements? Does he abandon
present defilements?" Then the objection is put in this way: "If he
abandons past defilements, he destroys what has already been destroyed,
causes to cease what has already ceased, causes to vanish what has
already vanished, causes to subside what has already subsided. What is
past, which is non-existent, that he abandons." But this is denied in
this way: "He does not abandon past defilements." Then the objection is
put in this way: "If he abandons future defilements, he abandons what
has not been born, he abandons what has not been generated, he abandons
what has not arisen, he abandons what has not become manifest. What is
future, which is non-existent, that he abandons." But this is denied in
this way: "He does not abandon future defilements." Then the objection
is put in this way: "If he abandons present defilements, then though
inflamed with greed he abandons greed, though corrupted with hate he
abandons hate, though deluded he abandons delusion, though shackled17 he
abandons conceit (pride), though misconceiving he abandons \[false\]
view, though distracted he abandons agitation, though not having made up
his mind he abandons uncertainty, though not having inveterate habits he
abandons inherent tendency, dark and bright states occur coupled
together, and there is development of a path that has defilement." But
this is all denied in this way: "He does not abandon past defilements,
he does not abandon future defilements, he does not abandon present
defilements." Finally it is asked: "Then there is no path development,
there is no realization of fruition, there is no abandoning of
defilements, there is no penetration to the Dhamma (convergence of
states)?" Then it is claimed: "There is path development ... there is
penetration to the Dhamma (convergence of states)."



And when it is asked: "In what way?" this is said: "Suppose there were a
young tree with unborn fruit, and a man cut its root, then the unborn
fruits of the tree would remain unborn and not come to be born, remain
ungenerated and not come to be generated, remain unarisen and not come
to be arisen, remain unmanifested and not come to be manifested. So too,
arising is a cause, arising is a condition, for the generation of
defilements. Seeing danger in defilements, consciousness enters into
non-arising. With consciousness's entering into non- arising the
defilements that would be generated with arising as their condition
remain unborn and do not come to be born ... remain unmanifest and do
not come to be manifested. So with the cessation of the cause there is
the cessation of suffering. \[687\] Occurrence is a cause ... The sign
is a cause ... Accumulation is a cause, accumulation is a condition, for
the generation of defilements. Seeing danger in accumulation,
consciousness enters into non-accumulation. With consciousness's
entering into non-accumulation the defilements that would be generated
with accumulation as their condition remain unborn and do not come to be
born ... remain unmanifest and do not come to be manifested. So with the



17\. "'*Shackled*': one whose consciousness is shackled by conceit
(pride)" (Vism-mhṭ 878).



[]



[]



cessation of the cause there is cessation of suffering. So there is path
development, there is realization of fruition, there is abandoning of
defilements, and there is penetrating to the Dhamma" (Paṭis II 217--19).



[80.]What does that show? It shows abandoning of defilements
that have soil \[to grow in\]. But are defilements that have soil \[to
grow in\] past, future or present? They are simply those described as
"arisen by having soil \[to grow in\]."



[81.] Now, there are various meanings of "arisen," that is to
say, (i) arisen as "actually occurring," (ii) arisen as "been and gone,"
(iii) arisen "by opportunity," and (iv) arisen "by having \[soil to grow
in\]."



Herein, (i) all that is reckoned to possess \[the three moments of\]
arising,



ageing, \[that is, presence\] and dissolution, is called *arisen as
actually occurring*.



[(ii)] Profitable and unprofitable \[kamma-result\] experienced
as the stimulus of an object and ceased-reckoned as "experienced and
gone" (*anubhūtāpagata)---*, and also anything formed, when it has
reached the three instants beginning with arising and has
ceased-reckoned as \`been and gone' *(hutvāpagata)---, * are called 
*arisen as been and gone* (*bhūtāpagata*).



[(iii)] Kamma described in the way beginning, "Deeds that he
did in the past" (M III 164), even when actually past, is called *arisen
by opportunity made* because it reaches presence by inhibiting other
\[ripening\] kamma and making that the opportunity for its own result
(see XIX.16.) And kamma-result that has its opportunity made in this
way, even when as yet unarisen, is called "arisen by opportunity made,"
too, because it is sure to arise when an opportunity for it has been
made in this way.



[(iv)] While unprofitable \[kamma\] is still unabolished in any
given soil (plane)18



it is called *arisen by having soil* \[*to grow in*\].



[82.] And here the difference between the soil and what has
soil should be understood. For "soil" (plane) means the five aggregates
in the three planes of becoming, which are the object of insight.19
"What has soil" is an expression for defilements capable of arising with
respect to those aggregates. Those defilements have that soil (plane).
That is why "by having soil \[to grow in\]" is said.



[83.]And that is not meant objectively. For defilements
occupied with an object arise with respect to any aggregates including
past or future ones as well \[as present\], and also with respect to the
\[subjectively\] fully-understood aggregates in someone \[else\] whose
cankers are destroyed, like those that arose in the rich man Soreyya
with respect to the aggregates in Mahā Kaccāna (Dhp-a I 325) and in the
brahman student Nanda with respect to Uppalavaṇṇā (Dhp-a II 49), and



18\. "'*In any given plane*' means aggregates as objects of clinging,
reckoned as a human or divine person" (Vism-mhṭ 879).\



19\. "By the words 'which are the object of insight' he points out the
non-fully- understood state of the aggregates, not merely the fact that
they are the object of insight, which is proved by his taking only the
three planes. For it is not-fully- understood aggregates among the
aggregates constituting the \[subjective\] basis that are intended as
the 'soil of defilements'" (Vism-mhṭ 880).



[]



[]



so on. And if that were what is called "arisen by having soil \[to grow
in\]" no one could abandon the root of becoming because it would be
unabandonable. But "arisen by having soil \[to grow in\]" should be
understood \[subjectively\] with respect to the basis \[for them in
oneself\].20 For the defilements that are the root of the round are
inherent in \[one's own\] aggregates not fully understood by insight
from the instant those aggregates arise. And that is what should be
understood as "arisen by having the soil \[to grow in\]," in the sense
of its being unabandoned. \[688\]



[84.]Now, when defilements are inherent, in the sense of being
unabandoned, in someone's aggregates, it is only those aggregates of his
that are the basis for those defilements, not aggregates belonging to
another. And only past aggregates, not others, are the basis for
defilements that inhere unabandoned in past aggregates. Likewise in the
case of future aggregates, and so on. Similarly too only sense-sphere
aggregates, not others, are the basis for defilements that inhere
unabandoned in sense-sphere aggregates. Likewise in the case of the fine
material and immaterial.



[85.]But in the case of the stream-enterer, etc., when a given
defilement, which is a root of the round, has been abandoned by means of
a given path in a given noble person's aggregates, then his aggregates
are no longer called "soil" for such defilement since they are no longer
a basis for it. But in an ordinary man the defilements that are the root
of the round are not abandoned at all, and so whatever kamma he performs
is always either profitable or unprofitable. So for him the round goes
on revolving with kamma and defilements as its condition.



[86.]But while it is thus the root of the round it cannot be
said that it is only in his materiality aggregate, and not in his other
aggregates beginning with feeling ... that it is only in his
consciousness aggregate, and not in his other aggregates beginning with
materiality. Why? Because it is inherent in all five aggregates
indiscriminately. How? Like the juice of humus, etc., in a tree.



[87.]For when a great tree is growing on the earth's surface
supported by the essences of humus and water and, with that as
condition, increases its roots, trunks, branches, twigs, shoots,
foliage, flowers, and fruit, till it fills the sky, and continues the
tree's lineage through the succession of the seed up till the end of the
eon, it cannot be said that the essence of humus, etc., are found only
in its root and not in the trunk, etc., ... that they are only in the
fruit and not in the root, etc., Why? Because they spread
indiscriminately through the whole of it from the root onwards.



[88.]But some man who felt revulsion for that same tree's
flowers, fruits, etc., might puncture it on four sides with the poison
thorn called "*maṇḍūka* thorn," and then the tree, being poisoned, would
be no more able to prolong its continuity since it would have become
barren with the contamination of the essences of humus and water.



20\. "No one would be able to abandon the root of becoming if it were in
another's continuity. '*With respect to the basis* \[*for them in
oneself*\]' means as the place of their arising; in that particular
becoming or continuity" (Vism-mhṭ 880).



[]



[]



So too the clansman who feels revulsion (dispassion) for the occurrence
of the aggregates, undertakes to develop the four paths in his own
continuity which is like the man's application of poison to the tree on
all four sides. Then the continuity of his aggregates is rendered
incapable of prolonging the continuity to a subsequent becoming. It is
now unproductive of future becoming since all kinds of kamma beginning
with bodily kamma are now merely functional: for the effect of the four
paths' poison has entirely exterminated the defilements that are the
root of the round. \[689\] Being without clinging, he inevitably attains
with the cessation of the last consciousness the complete extinction
\[of Nibbāna\], like a fire with no more fuel. This is how the
difference between the soil and what has soil should be understood.



[89.] Besides these there are four other ways of classing
"arisen," namely, (v) arisen as happening, (vi) arisen with apprehension
of an object, (vii) arisen through non-suppression, (viii) arisen
through non-abolition.



Herein, (v) *arisen as happening* is the same as (i) "arisen as actually
occurring."



[(vi)] When an object has at some previous time come into focus
in the eye, etc., and defilement did not arise then but arose in full
force later on simply because the object had been apprehended, then that
defilement is called *arisen with apprehension of an object*. Like the
defilement that arose in the Elder Mahā-Tissa after seeing the form of a
person of the opposite sex while wandering for alms in the village of
Kalyāna (cf. M-a I 66 and A-a to A I 4).



[(vii)] As long as a defilement is not suppressed by either
serenity or insight, though it may not have actually entered the
conscious continuity, it is nevertheless called  *arisen through
non-suppression* because there is no cause to prevent its arising \[if
suitable conditions combine\]. (viii) But even when they are suppressed
by serenity or insight they are still called *arisen through
non-abolition* because the necessity for their arising has not been
transcended unless they have been cut off by the path. Like the elder
who had obtained the eight attainments, and the defilements that arose
in him while he was going through the air on his hearing the sound of a
woman singing with a sweet voice as she was gathering flowers in a grove
of blossoming trees.



[90.] And the three kinds, namely, (vi) arisen with
apprehension of an object,



[(vii)] arisen through non-suppression, and (vii) arisen
through non-abolition, should be understood as included by (iv) arisen
by having soil \[to grow in\].



[91.] So as regard the kinds of "arisen" stated, the four
kinds, namely, (i) as actually occurring, (ii) as been and gone, (iii)
by opportunity made, and (v) as happening, cannot be abandoned by any
\[of these four kinds of\] knowledge because they cannot be eliminated
by the paths. But the four kinds of "arisen," namely, (iv) by having
soil \[to grow in\], (vi) with apprehension of an object, (vii) through
non-suppression, and (viii) through non-abolition, can all be abandoned
because a given mundane or supramundane knowledge, when it arises,
nullifies a given one of these modes of being arisen.



So here "the kinds of states that ought to be abandoned, also the act of
their



abandoning" (§32) should be known in this way.



[]



[]



\[THE FOUR FUNCTIONS\]



[92.] (6) Functions of full-understanding and the rest As
stated when truths are penetrated to,\
(7) Each one of which ought to be recognized\
According to its individual essence. (§32)



\[THE FOUR FUNCTIONS IN A SINGLE MOMENT\]



*6.* Now, at the times of penetrating to the truths each one of the four
\[path\] knowledges is said to exercise four functions in a single
moment. These are full- understanding, abandoning, realizing, and
developing; and each one of them ought to be recognized according to its
individual essence. \[690\] For this is said by the Ancients: "Just as a
lamp performs the four functions simultaneously in a single moment---it
burns the wick, dispels darkness, makes light appear, and uses up the
oil---, so too, path knowledge penetrates to the four truths
simultaneously in a single moment---it penetrates to suffering by
penetrating to it with full-understanding, penetrates to origination by
penetrating to it with abandoning, penetrates to the path by penetrating
to it with developing, and penetrates cessation by penetrating to it
with realizing" (see Peṭ 134). What is meant? By making cessation its
object it reaches, sees and pierces the four truths."



[93.] For this is said: "Bhikkhus, he who sees suffering sees
also the origin of suffering, sees also the cessation of suffering, sees
also the way leading to the cessation of suffering" (S V 437), etc., and
so it should be understood \[for all the other three truths\]. And
further it is said: "The knowledge of one who possesses the path is
knowledge of suffering and it is knowledge of the origin of suffering
and it is knowledge of the cessation of suffering and it is knowledge of
the way leading to the cessation of suffering" (Paṭis I 119).



[94.] As the lamp burns the wick, so his path knowledge fully
understands suffering; as the lamp dispels the darkness, so the
knowledge abandons origin; as the lamp makes the light appear, so the
knowledge \[as right view\] develops the path, in other words, the
states consisting in right thinking, etc., \[by acting\] as conascence,
etc., for them; and as the lamp uses up the oil, so the knowledge
realizes cessation, which brings defilements to an end. This is how the
application of the simile should be understood.



[95.] Another method: as the sun, when it rises, performs four
functions simultaneously with its appearance---it illuminates visible
objects, dispels darkness, causes light to be seen, and allays cold---,
so too, path knowledge ... penetrates to cessation by penetrating to it
with realizing. And here also, as the sun illuminates visible objects,
so path knowledge fully understands suffering; as the sun dispels
darkness, so path knowledge abandons origin; as the sun causes light to
be seen, so path knowledge \[as right view\] develops the \[other\] path
\[factors\] by acting as \[their\] conascence condition, etc.; as the
sun allays cold, so path knowledge realizes the cessation, which is the
tranquilizing of defilements. This is how the application of the simile
should be understood.



[96.] Another method: as a boat performs four functions
simultaneously in a



single moment---it leaves the hither shore, it cleaves the stream, it
carries its



[]



[]



cargo, \[691\] and it approaches the further shore---, so too, path
knowledge ... penetrates to cessation by penetrating to it with
realizing. And here, as the boat leaves the hither shore, so path
knowledge fully understands suffering; as the boat cleaves the stream,
so path knowledge abandons origin; as the boat carries its cargo, so
path knowledge develops the \[other\] path \[factors\] by acting as
\[their\] conascence condition, etc.; as the boat approaches the further
shore, so path knowledge realizes cessation, which is the further shore.
This is how the application of the simile should be understood.



[97.]So when his knowledge occurs with the four functions in a
single moment at the time of penetrating the four truths, then the four
truths have a single penetration in the sense of trueness (reality) in
sixteen ways, as it is said: "How is there single penetration of the
four truths in the sense of trueness? There is single penetration of the
four truths in the sense of trueness in sixteen aspects: suffering has
the meaning of oppressing, meaning of being formed, meaning of burning
(torment), meaning of change, as its meaning of trueness; origin has the
meaning of accumulation, meaning of source, meaning of bondage, meaning
of impediment, as its meaning of trueness; cessation has the meaning of
escape, meaning of seclusion, meaning of being not formed, meaning of
deathlessness, as its meaning of trueness; the path has the meaning of
outlet, meaning of cause, meaning of seeing, meaning of dominance, as
its meaning of trueness. The four truths in these sixteen ways are
included as one. What is included as one is unity. Unity is penetrated
by a single knowledge. Thus the four truths have a single penetration"
(Paṭis II 107).



[98.]Here it may be asked: "Since there are other meanings of
suffering, etc., too, such as 'a disease, a tumour' (Paṭis II 238; M I
435), etc., why then are only four mentioned for each?" We answer that
in this context it is better because of what is evident through seeing
the other \[three truths in each case\].



Firstly, in the passage beginning, "Herein, what is knowledge of
suffering? It is the understanding, the act of understanding ... that
arises contingent upon suffering" (Paṭis I 119), knowledge of the truths
is presented as having a single truth as its object \[individually\].
But in the passage beginning, "Bhikkhus, he who sees suffering also sees
its origin" (S V 437), it is presented as accomplishing its function
with respect to the other three truths simultaneously with its making
one of them its object.



[99.]As regards these \[two contexts\], when, firstly,
knowledge makes each truth its object singly, then \[when suffering is
made the object\], suffering has the characteristic of *oppressing* as
its individual essence, but its *sense of being formed* becomes evident
through seeing origin because that suffering is accumulated, formed,
agglomerated, by the origin, which has the characteristic of
accumulating. Then the cooling path removes the burning of the
defilements, \[692\] and so suffering's *sense of burning* becomes
evident through seeing the path, as the beauty's (Sundarī's) ugliness
did to the venerable Nanda through seeing the celestial nymphs (see Ud
23). But its *sense of changing* becomes evident through seeing
cessation as not subject to change, which needs no explaining.



[]



[]



[100.] Likewise, \[when origin is made the object,\] origin has
the characteristic of *accumulating* as its individual essence; but its
*sense of source* becomes evident through seeing suffering, just as the
fact that unsuitable food is the source of a sickness, becomes evident
through seeing how a sickness arises owing to such food. Its *sense of
bondage* becomes evident through seeing cessation, which has no bonds.
And its *sense of impediment* becomes evident through seeing the path,
which is the outlet.



[101.] Likewise, \[when cessation is made the object,\]
cessation has the characteristic of an *escape*. But its *sense of
seclusion* becomes evident through seeing origin as unsecluded. Its
*sense of being not formed* becomes evident through seeing the path; for
the path has never been seen by him before in the beginningless round of
rebirths, and yet even that is formed since it has conditions, and so
the unformedness of the conditionless becomes quite clear. But its
*sense of being deathless* becomes evident through seeing suffering; for
suffering is poison and Nibbāna is deathless.



[102.] Likewise, \[when the path is made the object,\] the path
has the characteristic of the *outlet*. But its *sense of cause* becomes
evident through seeing origin thus, "That is not the cause, \[but on the
contrary\] this is the cause, for the attaining of Nibbāna." Its *sense
of seeing* becomes evident through seeing cessation, as the eye's
clearness becomes evident to one who sees very subtle visible objects
and thinks, "How clear my eye is!" Its *sense of dominance* becomes
evident through seeing suffering, just as the superiority of lordly
people becomes evident through seeing wretched people afflicted with
many diseases.



[103.] So in that \[first\] context four senses are stated for
each truth because in the case of each truth \[individually\] one sense
becomes evident as the specific characteristic, while the other three
become evident through seeing the remaining three truths.



At the path moment, however, all these senses are penetrated
simultaneously by a single knowledge that has four functions with
respect to suffering and the rest. But about those who would have it
that \[the different truths\] are penetrated to separately, more is said
in the Abhidhamma in the Kathāvatthu (Kv 212--20).



\[THE FOUR FUNCTIONS DESCRIBED SEPARATELY\]



[104.] *7.* Now, as to those four functions beginning with
full-understanding, which were mentioned above (§92):



\(a\) Full-understanding is threefold;\
So too (b) abandoning, and (c) realizing,\
And (d) two developings are reckoned---\
Thus should be known the exposition.



[105.] (a)  *Full-understanding is threefold*, that is, (i)
full understanding as the known, (ii) full-understanding as
investigating (judging), and (iii) full- understanding as abandoning
(see XX.3).



[106.] (i) Herein, *full-understanding as the known* \[693\] is
summarized thus:



"Understanding that is direct-knowledge is knowledge in the sense of the



[]



[]



known" (Paṭis I 87). It is briefly stated thus: "Whatever states are
directly known are known" (Paṭis I 87). It is given in detail in the way
beginning: "Bhikkhus, all is to be directly known. And what is all that
is to be directly known? Eye is to be directly known *...*" (Paṭis I 5).
Its particular plane is the direct knowing of mentality-materiality with
its conditions.



[107.] (ii)  *Full-understanding as investigating (judging)* is
summarized thus: "Understanding that is full-understanding is knowledge
in the sense of investigation (judging)" (Paṭis I 87). It is briefly
stated thus: "Whatever states are fully understood are investigated
(judged)" (Paṭis I 87). It is given in detail in the way beginning:
"Bhikkhus, all is to be fully understood. And what is all that is to be
fully understood? The eye is to be fully understood *...*" (Paṭis I 22)
Its particular plane starts with comprehension by groups, and occurring
as investigation of impermanence, suffering, and not-self, it extends as
far as conformity (cf. XX.4).



[108.](iii) *Full-understanding as abandoning* is summarized
thus: "Understanding that is abandoning is knowledge in the sense of
giving up" (Paṭis I 87). It is stated in detail thus: Whatever states
are abandoned are given up" (Paṭis I 87). It occurs in the way
beginning: "Through the contemplation of impermanence he abandons the
perception of permanence *...*" (cf. Paṭis I 58). Its plane extends from
the contemplation of dissolution up to path knowledge. This is what is
intended here.



[109.] Or alternatively, full-understanding as the known and
full-understanding as investigating have that \[third kind\] as their
aim, too, and whatever states a man abandons are certainly known and
investigated, and so all three kinds of full-understanding can be
understood in this way as the function of path knowledge.



[110.](b) *So too abandoning*: abandoning is threefold too,
like full-understanding, that is, (i) abandoning by suppressing, (ii)
abandoning by substitution of opposites, and (iii) abandoning by cutting
off.



[111.] (i) Herein, when any of the mundane kinds of
concentration suppresses opposing states such as the hindrances, that
act of suppressing, which is like the pressing down of water-weed by
placing a porous pot on weed-filled water, is called *abandoning by
suppressing*. But the suppression of only the hindrances is given in the
text thus: "And there is abandoning of the hindrances by suppression in
one who develops the first jhāna" (Paṭis I 27). However, that should be
understood as so stated because of the obviousness \[of the suppression
then\]. For even before and after the jhāna as well hindrances do not
invade consciousness suddenly; but applied thought, etc., \[are
suppressed\] only at the moment of actual absorption \[in the second
jhāna, etc.,\] and so the suppression of the hindrances then is obvious.



[112.] (ii) But what is called *abandoning by substitution of
opposites* is the abandoning of any given state that ought to be
abandoned through the means of a particular factor of knowledge, which
as a constituent of insight is opposed to it, like the abandoning of
darkness at night through the means of a light. \[694\] It is in fact
the abandoning firstly of the \[false\] view of individuality through



[]



[]



the means of delimitation of mentality-materiality; the abandoning of
both the no-cause view and the fictitious-cause view and also of the
stain of doubt through the means of discerning conditions; the
abandoning of apprehension of a conglomeration as "I" and "mine" through
the means of comprehension by groups; the abandoning of perception of
the path in what is not the path through the means of the definition of
what is the path and what is not the path; the abandoning of the
annihilation view through the means of seeing rise; the abandoning of
the eternity view through the means of seeing fall; the abandoning of
the perception of non-terror in what is terror through the means of
appearance as terror; the abandoning of the perception of enjoyment
through the means of seeing danger; the abandoning of the perception of
delight through the means of the contemplation of dispassion
(revulsion); the abandoning of lack of desire for deliverance through
the means of desire for deliverance; the abandoning of non-reflection
through the means of reflection; the abandoning of not looking on
equably through the means of equanimity; the abandoning of apprehension
contrary to truth through the means of conformity.



[113.] And also in the case of the eighteen principal insights
the abandoning by substitution of opposites is: (1) the abandoning of
the perception of the perception of permanence, through the means of the
contemplation of impermanence; (2) of the perception of pleasure,
through the means of the contemplation of pain; (3) of the perception of
self, through the means of the contemplation of not-self; (4) of
delight, through the means of the contemplation of dispassion
(revulsion); (5) of greed, through the means of the contemplation of
fading away; (6) of originating, through the means of the contemplation
of cessation; (7) of grasping, through the means of the contemplation of
relinquishment; (8) of the perception of compactness, through the means
of the contemplation of destruction; (9) of accumulation, through the
means of the contemplation of fall; (10) of the perception of
lastingness, through the means of the contemplation of change; (11) of
the sign, through the means of the contemplation of the signless; (12)
of desire, through the means of the contemplation of the desireless;
(13) of misinterpreting (insisting), through the means of the
contemplation of voidness; (14) of misinterpreting (insisting) due to
grasping at a core, through the means of insight into states that is
higher understanding; (15) of misinterpreting (insisting) due to
confusion, through the means of correct knowledge and vision; (16) of
misinterpreting (insisting) due to reliance \[on formations\], through
the means of the contemplation of danger \[in them\]; (17) of
non-reflection, through the means of the contemplation of reflection;
(18) of misinterpreting (insisting) due to bondage, through means of
contemplation of turning away (cf. Paṭis I 47).



[114.] Herein, (1)--(7) the way in which the abandoning of the
perception of permanence, etc., takes place through the means of the
seven contemplations beginning with that of impermanence has already
been explained under the contemplation of dissolution (Ch. XXI.15f.).



\(8\) *Contemplation of destruction*, however, is the knowledge in one
who effects



the resolution of the compact and so sees destruction as "impermanent in
the



[]



[]



sense of destruction." Through the means of that knowledge there comes
to be the abandoning of the perception of compactness.



[115.] (9)  *Contemplation of fall* is stated thus:



"Defining both to be alike\
By inference from that same object.\
Intentness on cessation---these\
Are insight in the mark of fall" (Paṭis I 58).



It is intentness on cessation, in other words, on that same dissolution,
after seeing dissolution of \[both seen and unseen\] formations by
personal experience and by inference \[respectively\]. Through the means
of that contemplation there comes to be the abandoning of accumulation.
When a man sees with insight that "The things for the sake of which I
might accumulate \[kamma\] are thus \[695\] subject to fall," his
consciousness no longer inclines to accumulation.



[116.](10) *Contemplation of change* is the act of seeing,
according to the material septad, etc., how \[momentary\] occurrences
\[in continuity\] take place differently by \[gradually\] diverging from
any definition; or it is the act of seeing change in the two aspects of
the ageing and the death of what is arisen. Through the means of that
contemplation the perception of lastingness is abandoned.



[117.] (11)  *Contemplation of the signless* is the same as the
contemplation of



impermanence. Through its means the sign of permanence is abandoned.



(12)  *Contemplation of the desireless* is the same as the contemplation
of pain.



Through its means desire for pleasure and hope for pleasure are
abandoned.



(13)  *Contemplation of voidness* is the same as the contemplation of
not-self. Through its means the misinterpreting (insisting) that "a self
exists" (see S IV 400) is abandoned.



[118.](14) Insight into states that is higher understanding is
stated thus:



"Having reflected on the object,\
Dissolution he contemplates,\
Appearance then as empty---this\
Is insight of higher understanding" (Paṭis I 58).



Insight so described occurs after knowing materiality, etc., as object,
by seeing the dissolution both of that object and of the consciousness
whose object it was, and by apprehending voidness through the
dissolution in this way: "Only formations break up. It is the death of
formations. There is nothing else." Taking that insight as higher
understanding and as insight with respect to states, it is called
"insight into states that is higher understanding." Through its means
misinterpreting (insisting) due to grasping at a core is abandoned,
because it has been clearly seen that there is no core of permanence and
no core of self.



[119.](15) *Correct knowledge and vision* is the discernment of
mentality-materiality with its conditions. Through its means
misinterpreting (insisting) due to confusion that occurs in this way,
"Was I in the past?" (M I 8), and in this way, "The world was created by
an Overlord," are abandoned.



[]



[]



[120.] (16)  *Contemplation of danger* is knowledge seeing
danger in all kinds of becoming, etc., which as arisen owing to
appearance as terror. Through its means misinterpreting (insisting) due
to reliance is abandoned, since he does not see any \[formation\] to be
relied on for shelter.



\(17\) *Contemplation of reflection* is the reflection that effects the
means to liberation. Through its means non-reflection is abandoned.



[121.] (18)  *Contemplation of turning away* is equanimity
about formations and conformity. For at that point his mind is said to
retreat, retract and recoil from the whole field of formations, as a
water drop does on a lotus leaf that slopes a little. That is why
through its means misinterpreting (insisting) due to bondage is
abandoned. \[696\] The meaning is: abandoning of the occurrence of
defilement that consists in misinterpreting defiled by the bondage of
sense desires, and so on.



Abandoning by substitution of the opposites should be understood in
detail in this way. But in the texts it is stated in brief thus:
"Abandoning of views by substitution of opposites comes about in one who
develops concentration partaking of penetration" (Paṭis I 27).



[122.] (iii) The abandoning of the states beginning with the
fetters by the noble path knowledge in such a way that they never occur
again, like a tree struck by a thunderbolt, is called *abandoning by
cutting off*. With reference to this it is said: "Abandoning by cutting
off comes about in one who develops the supramundane path that leads to
the destruction \[of defilements\]" (Paṭis I 27).



[123.] So of these three kinds of abandoning, it is only
abandoning by cutting off that is intended here. But since that
meditator's previous abandoning by suppression and by substitution by
opposites have that \[third kind\] as their aim, too, all three kinds of
abandoning can therefore be understood in this way as the function of
path knowledge. For when a man has gained an empire by killing off the
opposing kings, what was done by him previous to that is also called
"done by the king."



[124.] (c)  *Realizing* is divided into two as (i) mundane
realizing, and (ii) supramundane realizing. And it is threefold too with
the subdivision of the supramundane into two as seeing and developing.



[125.] (i) Herein, the touch (*phassanā*) of the first jhāna,
etc., as given in the way beginning, "I am an obtainer, a master, of the
first jhāna; the first jhāna has been realized by me" (Vin III 93--94),
is called *mundane realizing*. "Touch" (*phassanā*) is the touching
(*phusanā*) with the contact (*phassa*) of knowledge by personal
experience on arriving, thus, "This has been arrived at by me".21 With
reference to this meaning realization is summarized thus, "Understanding
that is



21\. "'*With the contact of knowledge by personal experience*' means by
personal experience of it as object, which is what the 'contact of
knowledge' is called. The words, 'By personal experience' exclude taking
it as an object by inference. For what is intended here as the 'contact
of knowledge' is knowing by personal experience through reviewing thus,
'This is like this'" (Vism-mhṭ 888).



[]



[]



realization is knowledge in the sense of touch" (Paṭis I 87), after
which it is described thus, "Whatever states are realized are touched"
(Paṭis I 87).



[126.] Also, those states which are not aroused in one's own
continuity and are known through knowledge that depends on another are
realized; for it is said, referring to that, "Bhikkhus, all should be
realized. And what is all that should be realized? The eye should be
realized" (Paṭis I 35), and so on. And it is further said: "One who sees
materiality realizes it. One who sees \[697\] feeling ... perception ...
formations ... consciousness realizes it. One who sees the eye ...
(etc., see XX.9) ... ageing and death realizes it. \[One who sees
suffering\] ... (etc.)22 ... One who sees Nibbāna, which merges in the
deathless \[in the sense of the end\] realizes it. Whatever states are
realized are touched" (Paṭis I 35).



[127.] (ii) The seeing of Nibbāna at the moment of the first
path is *realizing as* *seeing*. At the other path moments it is
*realizing as developing*. And it is intended as twofold here. So
realizing of Nibbāna as seeing and as developing should be understood as
a function of this knowledge.



[128.](d) *And two developings are reckoned*: but developing is
also reckoned as twofold, namely as (i) mundane developing, and (ii) as
supramundane developing.



[(i)] Herein, the arousing of mundane virtue, concentration and
understanding, and the influencing of the continuity by their means, is
*mundane developing*. And (ii) the arousing of supramundane virtue,
concentration and understanding, and the influencing of the continuity
by them, is *supramundane developing*. Of these, it is the supramundane
that is intended here. For this fourfold knowledge arouses supramundane
virtue, etc., since it is their conascence condition, and it influences
the continuity by their means. So it is only supramundane developing
that is a function of it. Therefore these are the:



Functions of full-understanding, and the rest\
As stated when truths are penetrated to,\
Each one of which ought to be recognized\
According to its individual essence.



\[CONCLUSION\]



[129.] Now, with reference to the stanza:



"When a wise man, established well in virtue,\
Develops consciousness and understanding" (I.1),



it was said above "After he has perfected the two purifications that are
the 'roots,' then he can develop the five purifications that are the
'trunk'"(XIV.32). And at this point the detailed exposition of the
system for developing



22\. The first elision here---"The eye ... ageing-and-death"---is
explained in XX.9. The second elision---"One who sees suffering ... One
who sees Nibbāna, which merges in the deathless in the sense of end
..."---covers all things listed from Paṭis I 8, line 18 (N.B. the new
para in the Paṭis text should begin with the words "*dukkhaṃ
abhiññeyyaṃ*" up to p. 22, line 11, *amatogadhaṃ nibbānaṃ
pariyosānatthaṃ abhiññeyyaṃ*). In this case, however (Paṭis I 35),
*sacchikātabba* ("to be realized"), etc., is substituted for
*abhiññeyya* ("to be directly known").

understanding in the proper way as it has been handed down is completed.
So the question, "How should it be developed?" (XIV.32) is now answered.



The twenty-second chapter called "The Description of Purification by
Knowledge and Vision" in the Treatise on\
the Development of Understanding in the *Path of Purification* composed
for the purpose of gladdening good people.

## CHAPTER XXIII 


THE BENEFITS IN DEVELOPING UNDERSTANDING



(*Paññābhāvanānisaṃsa-niddesa*)



[1.] (vi) W*HAT  ARE  THE  BENEFITS  IN  DEVELOPING 
UNDERSTANDING?* (See XIV.1)** ** \[698\]



To that question, which was asked above, we reply that this development
of understanding has many hundred benefits. But it would be impossible
to explain its benefits in detail, however long a time were taken over
it. Briefly, though, its benefits should be understood as these: (A)
removal of the various defilements, (B) experience of the taste of the
noble fruit, (C) ability to attain the attainment of cessation, and (D)
achievement of worthiness to receive gifts and so on.



\[A. Removal of the Defilements\]



[2.] Herein, it should be understood that one of the benefits
of the mundane development of understanding is the removal of the
various defilements beginning with \[mistaken\] view of individuality.
This starts with the delimitation of mentality-materiality. Then one of
the benefits of the supramundane development of understanding is the
removal, at the path moment, of the various defilements beginning with
the fetters.



With dreadful thump the thunderbolt\
Annihilates the rock.\
The fire whipped by the driving wind\
Annihilates the wood.



The radiant orb of solar flame\
Annihilates the dark.\
Developed understanding, too,\
Annihilates inveterate



Defilements' netted overgrowth,\
The source of every woe.\
This blessing in this very life\
A man himself may know.



\[B. The Taste of the Noble Fruit\]



[3.]Not only the removal of the various defilements but also
the experience of the taste of the noble fruit is a benefit of the
development of understanding. \[699\] For it is the fruitions of
stream-entry, etc.---the fruits of asceticism---that are called


[]



[]



the "noble fruit." Its taste is experienced in two ways, that is to say,
in its occurrence in the cognitive series of the path, and in its
occurrence in the attainment of fruition. Of these, only its occurrence
in the cognitive series of the path has been shown (XXII.3f.).



[4.]Furthermore, when people say that the fruit is the mere
abandoning of fetters1 and nothing more than that, the following sutta
can be cited in order to convince them that they are wrong: "How is it
that understanding of the tranquilizing of effort is knowledge of fruit?
At the moment of the stream-entry path right view in the sense of seeing
emerges from wrong view, and it emerges from the defilements and from
the aggregates that occur consequent upon that \[wrong view\], and
externally it emerges from all signs. Right view arises because of the
tranquilizing of that effort. This is the fruit of the path" (Paṭis I
71), and this should be given in detail. Also such passages as, "The
four paths and the four fruits---these states have a measureless object"
(Dhs §1408), and, "An exalted state is a condition, as proximity
condition, for a measureless state" (Paṭṭh II 227 (Be)), establish the
meaning here.



[5.]However, in order to show how it occurs in the attainment
of fruition there is the following set of questions:



[(i)]



What is fruition attainment?



[(ii)]



Who attains it?



[(iii)]



Who do not attain it?



[(iv)]



Why do they attain it?



[(v)]



How does its attainment come about?



[(vi)]



How is it made to last?



[(vii)]



How does the emergence from it come about?



[(viii)]



What is next to fruition?



[(ix)]



What is fruition next to?



[6.] Herein, (i) *What is fruition attainment*? It is
absorption in the cessation in which the noble fruition consists.



[(ii)] *Who attains it?* (iii) *Who do not attain it*? No
ordinary men attain it. Why? Because it is beyond their reach. But all
Noble Ones attain it. Why? Because it is within their reach. But those
who have reached a higher path do not attain a lower fruition because
the state of each successive person is more tranquilized than the one
below. And those who have only reached a lower path do not attain a
higher fruition because it is beyond their reach. But each one attains
his appropriate fruition. This is what has been agreed here.



[7.]But there are some who say that the stream-enterer and
once-returner do not attain it, and that only the two above them attain
it. The reason they give is that



1\. "It is the Andhakas, etc., who maintain this; for they take the
sutta wrongly which says, '"Arahantship" is said, friend Sāriputta; what
is Arahantship?---The destruction of greed, the destruction of hate, the
destruction of delusion: that is what is called Arahantship" (S IV 252),
taking it literally and asserting that nothing exists called Arahantship
and that it is only the abandoning of defilements that is so called by
common usage. And they deny that there are any other fruitions"
(Vism-mhṭ 891).



[]



[]



only these two show achievement in concentration. But that is no reason,
since even the ordinary man attains such mundane concentration as is
within his reach. But why argue here over what is and what is not a
reason? Is it not said in the texts as follows?



"Which ten states of change-of-lineage arise \[700\] through insight?



"For the purpose of obtaining the stream-entry path it overcomes
arising, occurrence ... (etc., see XXII.5) ... despair, and externally
the sign of formations, thus it is change-of-lineage.



"For the purpose of attaining the stream-entry fruition ...



"For the purpose of attaining the once-return path ...



"For the purpose of attaining the once-return fruition ...



"For the purpose of attaining the non-return path ...



"For the purpose of attaining the non-return fruition ...



"For the purpose of attaining the Arahant path ...



"For the purpose of attaining the Arahant fruition ...



"For the purpose of attaining the void abiding ...



"For the purpose of attaining the signless abiding it overcomes arising,
occurrence ... (etc.) ... despair, and externally the sign of
formations, thus it is change-of-lineage" (Paṭis I 68).2 From that it
must be concluded that all Noble Ones attain each their own fruit.



[8.](iv) *Why do they attain it*? For the purpose of abiding in
bliss here and now. For just as a king experiences royal bliss and a
deity experiences divine bliss, so too the Noble Ones think, "We shall
experience the noble supramundane bliss," and after deciding on the
duration, they attain the attainment of fruition whenever they choose.3



[9.](v)  *How does its attainment come about*? (vi) *How is it
made to last*? (vii) *How does the emergence from it come about*?



[(v)] In the first place its attainment comes about for two
reasons: with not bringing to mind any object other than Nibbāna, and
with bringing Nibbāna to mind, according as it is said: "Friend, there
are two conditions for the attainment of the signless mind-deliverance;
they are the non-bringing to mind of all signs, and the bringing to mind
of the signless element" (M I 296).



[10.]Now, the process of attaining it is as follows. A noble
disciple who seeks the attainment of fruition should go into solitary
retreat. He should see formations with insight according to rise and
fall and so on. When that insight has progressed \[as far as
conformity\], then comes change-of-lineage knowledge



2\. The quotation in the Vism texts does not quite agree with the Paṭis
text (Ee) where (as the sense demands) the words "*bahiddhā
saṅkhāranimittaṃ*" do not follow the four fruitions and the two abidings
but only the four paths.\



3\. "Although they are resultant states, nevertheless the states of
fruition attainment occur in the noble person only when he chooses since
they do not arise without the preliminary work and do so only when they
are given predominance" (Vism-mhṭ 895).



[]



[]



with formations as its object.4 And immediately next to it consciousness
becomes absorbed in cessation with the attainment of fruition. And here
it is only fruition, not path, that arises even in a trainer, because
his tendency is to fruition attainment.



[11.]But there are those5 who say that when a stream-enterer
embarks on insight, thinking, "I shall attain fruition attainment," he
becomes a once-returner, and a once-returner, a non-returner. They
should be told: "In that case a non-returner becomes an Arahant and an
Arahant, a Paccekabuddha and a Paccekabuddha, a Buddha. For that reason,
and because it is contradicted as well by the text quoted above, none of
that should be accepted. Only this should be accepted: fruition itself,
not path, arises also in the trainer. And if the path he has arrived at
had the first jhāna, his fruition will have the first jhāna too when it
arises. If the path has the second, so will the fruition. And so with
the other jhānas."



This, firstly, is how attaining comes about. \[701\]



[12.](vi) It is made to last in three ways, because of the
words: "Friend, there are three conditions for the persistence of the
signless mind-deliverance: they are the non-bringing to mind of all
signs, the bringing to mind of the signless element, and the *prior
volition*" (M I 296--97). Herein, the prior volition is the
predetermining of the time before attaining;6 for it is by determining
it thus, "I shall emerge at such a time," that it lasts until that time
comes. This is how it is made to last.



[13.] (vii) Emergence from it comes about in two ways, because
of the words: "Friend, there are two conditions for the emergence from
the signless mind- deliverance: they are the bringing to mind of all
signs, and the non-bringing to mind of the signless element" (M I 297).
Herein, of all signs means the sign of materiality, sign of feeling,
perception, formations, and consciousness. Of course, a man does not
bring all those to mind at once, but this is said in order to include
all. So the emergence from the attainment of fruition comes about in him
when he brings to mind whatever is the object of the life-continuum.7



[14.](viii)  *What is next to fruition*? (ix) *What is fruition
next to*? In the first case (viii) either fruition itself is next to
fruition or the life-continuum is next to it. But (ix) there is fruition
that is (a) next to the path, (b) there is that next to fruition, (c)
there is that next to change-of-lineage, and (d) there is that next to
the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception.



4\. "Why does change-of-lineage not have Nibbāna as its object here as
it does when it precedes the path? Because states belonging to fruition
are not associated with an outlet \[as in the case of the path\]. For
this is said: 'What states are an outlet? The four unincluded paths'
(Dhs §1592)" (Vism-mhṭ 895).\



5\. "Those of the Abhayagiri Monastery in Anurādhapura" (Vism-mhṭ 895).



6\. "The '*volition*' is attaining after deciding the time limit in this
way, 'When the moon, or the sun, has gone so far, I shall emerge,' which
is an act of volition" (Vism-mhṭ 897).



7\. "It is because he is called 'emerged from attainment' as soon as the
life-continuum consciousness has arisen that '*he brings to mind that
which is the object of the life-continuum*' is said. Kamma, etc., are
called the object of the life-continuum (see Ch. XVII, §133ff.)"
(Vism-mhṭ 897).



[]



[]



Herein, (a) it is *next to the path* in the cognitive series of the
path. (b) Each one that is subsequent to a previous one is *next to
fruition*. (c) Each first one in the attainments of fruition is *next to
change-of-lineage*. And conformity should be understood here as
"change-of-lineage"; for this is said in the Paṭṭhāna: "In the Arahant,
conformity is a condition, as proximity condition, for fruition
attainment. In trainers, conformity is a condition, as proximity
condition, for fruition attainment" (Paṭṭh I 159). (d) The fruition by
means of which there is emergence from the attainment of cessation is
*next to the base consisting of neither perception non-perception*.



[15.]Herein, all except the fruition that arises in the
cognitive series of the path occur as fruition attainment. So whether it
arises in the cognitive series of the path or in fruition attainment:



Asceticism's fruit sublime,\
Which tranquilizes all distress,\
Its beauty from the Deathless draws,\
Its calm from lack of worldliness. \[702\]



Of a sweet purifying bliss\
It is the fountainhead besides,\
Whose honey-sweet ambrosia\
A deathless sustenance provides.



Now, if a wise man cultivates\
His understanding, he shall know\
This peerless bliss, which is the taste\

\[C. The Attainment of Cessation\]



[16.]And not only the experience of the taste of the noble
fruit but also the ability to attain the attainment of cessation should
be understood as a benefit of the development of understanding.



[17.] Now, in order to explain the attainment of cessation
there is this set of questions:



[(i)]



What is the attainment of cessation?



[(ii)]



Who attains it?



[(iii)]



Who do not attain it?



[(iv)]



Where do they attain it?



[(v)]



Why do they attain it?



[(vi)]



How does its attainment come about?



[(vii)]



How is it made to last?



[(viii)]



How does the emergence from it come about?



[(ix)]



Towards what does the mind of one who has emerged tend?



[]



[]



[(x)]



What is the difference between one who has attained it and one



who is dead?



[(xi)]



Is the attainment of cessation formed or unformed, mundane or



supramundane, produced or unproduced?



[18.] Herein, (i) *What is the attainment of cessation*? It is
the non-occurrence of



consciousness and its concomitants owing to their progressive cessation.



[(ii)]  *Who attains it*? (iii) *Who do not attain it*? No
ordinary men, no stream- enterers or once-returners, and no
non-returners and Arahants who are bare- insight workers attain it. But
both non-returners and those with cankers destroyed (Arahants) who are
obtainers of the eight attainments attain it. For it is said:
"Understanding that is mastery, owing to possession of two powers, to
the tranquilization of three formations, to sixteen kinds of exercise of
knowledge, and to nine kinds of exercise of concentration, is knowledge
of the attainment of cessation" (Paṭis I 97). And these qualifications
are not to be found together in any persons other than non-returners and
those whose cankers are destroyed, who are obtainers of the eight
attainments. That is why only they and no others attain it.



[19.]But which are the *two powers*? And the \[*three
formations*\] ... and mastery? Here there is no need for us to say
anything; for it has all been said in the description of the summary
\[quoted above\], according as it is said:



[20.] "*Of the two powers*: of the two powers, the serenity
power and the insight power. \[703\]



"What is *serenity* as a power? The unification of the mind and
non-distraction due to renunciation are serenity as a power. The
unification of the mind and non-distraction due to non-ill will are
serenity as a power. The unification of the mind and non-distraction due
to perception of light ... \[to non-distraction ... to defining of
states (*dhamma*) ... to knowledge ... to gladness ... to the eight
attainments, the ten kasiṇas, the ten recollections, the nine
charnel-ground contemplations, and the thirty-two modes of mindfulness
of breathing\]8 ... the unification of the mind and non-distraction due
to breathing out in one who is contemplating relinquishment9 is serenity
as a power.



[21.] "In what sense is serenity a *power*? Owing to the first
jhāna it does not waver on account of the hindrances, thus serenity is a
power. Owing to the second jhāna it does not waver on account of applied
and sustained thought, thus serenity is a power ... (etc.) ... Owing to
the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception it does not
waver on account of the perception of the base consisting of
nothingness, thus serenity is a power. It does not waver and vacillate
and hesitate on account of agitation and on account of the defilements
and the aggregates that accompany agitation, thus serenity is a power.
This is the serenity power.



8\. The list in brackets represents in summarized form the things listed
at Paṭis I 94-- 95, repeated in this context in the Paṭisambhidā but
left out in the Vism quotation.



9\. The serenity shown here is access concentration (see Vism-mhṭ 899).

[22.]"What is *insight* as a power? Contemplation of
impermanence is insight as a power. Contemplation of pain ...
Contemplation of not-self ... Contemplation of dispassion ...
Contemplation of fading away ... Contemplation of cessation ...
Contemplation of relinquishment is insight as a power. Contemplation of
impermanence in materiality ... (etc.) ... Contemplation of
relinquishment in materiality is insight as a power. Contemplation of
impermanence in feeling ... in perception ... in formations ... in
consciousness is insight as a power ... Contemplation of relinquishment

the eye ... (etc., see XX.9) ... Contemplation of impermanence in
ageing-and-death ... (etc.) ... Contemplation of relinquishment in
ageing-and-death is insight as a power.



[23.] "In what sense is insight a *power*? Owing to the
contemplation of impermanence it does not waver on account of perception
of permanence, thus insight is a power. Owing to the contemplation of
pain it does not waver on account of perception of pleasure ... Owing to
the contemplation of not-self it does not waver on account of the
perception of self ... Owing to the contemplation of dispassion it does
not waver on account of delight ... Owing to the contemplation of fading
away it does not waver on account of greed ... Owing to the
contemplation of cessation it does not waver on account of arising ...
Owing to the contemplation of relinquishment it does not waver on
account of grasping, thus insight is a power. It does not waver and
vacillate and hesitate on account of ignorance and on account of the
defilements and the aggregates that accompany ignorance, thus insight is
a power.



[24.]"*Owing to the tranquilization of three formations*: owing
to the tranquilization of what three formations? In one who has attained
the second jhāna the verbal formations consisting in applied and
sustained thought are quite tranquilized. In one who has attained the
fourth jhāna the bodily formations consisting in in-breaths and out-
breaths are quite tranquilized. In one who has attained cessation of
perception and feeling the mental formations consisting in feeling and
perception are quite tranquilized. It is owing to the tranquilization of
these three formations.



[25.] "*Owing to sixteen kinds of exercise of knowledge*: owing
to what sixteen kinds of exercise of knowledge? Contemplation of
impermanence is a kind of exercise of knowledge. Contemplation of pain
... Contemplation of not-self ... Contemplation of dispassion ...
Contemplation of fading away ... Contemplation of cessation ...

of the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception is a
kind of exercise of concentration. And the applied thought and sustained

purpose of attaining the first jhāna ... (etc.) ... And the applied
thought and sustained thought and happiness and bliss and unification of
mind that have the purpose of attaining the attainment of the base
consisting of neither perception nor non-perception. It is owing to
these nine kinds of exercise of concentration.10



[27.]"Mastery: there are five kinds of mastery. There is
mastery in adverting, in attaining, in resolving, in emerging, in
reviewing. He adverts to the first jhāna where, when, and for as long as
he wishes, he has no difficulty in adverting, thus it is mastery in
adverting. He attains the first jhāna where, when, and for as long as he
wishes, he has no difficulty in attaining, thus it is mastery in
attaining. He resolves upon \[the duration of\] the first jhāna where,
... thus it is mastery in resolving. He emerges from the first jhāna,
... thus it is mastery in emerging. He reviews the first jhāna where,
when, and for as long as he wishes, he has no difficulty in reviewing,
thus it is mastery in reviewing. He adverts to the second jhāna ...
(etc.) ... He reviews the attainment of the base consisting of neither
perception nor non-perception where, when, and for as long as he wishes,
he has no difficulty in reviewing, thus it is mastery in reviewing.
These are the five kinds of mastery" (Paṭis I 97--100).



[28.]And here the words: "Owing to sixteen kinds of exercise of
knowledge" state the maximum. But in a non-returner the mastery is owing
to fourteen kinds of exercise of knowledge. If that is so, then does it
not come about also in the once-returner owing to twelve? And in the
stream-enterer owing to ten?---It does not. Because the greed based on
the cords of sense desire, which is an obstacle to concentration, is
unabandoned in them. It is because that is not abandoned in them that
the serenity power is not perfected. Since it is not perfected they are
not, owing to want of power, able to attain the attainment of cessation,
which has to be attained by the two powers. But it is abandoned in the
non-returner and so his power is perfected. Since his power is perfected
he is able to attain it.



Hence the Blessed One said: "Profitable \[consciousness\] of the base
consisting of neither perception nor non-perception in one emerging from
cessation is a condition, as proximity condition, for the attainment of
fruition" (Paṭṭh I 159). For this is said in the Great Book of the
Paṭṭhāna11 with reference only to non- returners' emerging from
cessation. \[705\]



10\. The nine are the four fine-material jhānas, the four immaterial
jhānas, and the access concentration preceding each of the eight
attainments, described in the last sentence and counted as one.\



11\. "The word '*profitable*' used in this Paṭṭhāna passage shows that
it app1ies only to non-returners, otherwise 'functional' would have been
said" (Vism-mhṭ 902).

[29.](iv) *Where do they attain it*? In the five-constituent
becoming. Why? Because of the necessity for the succession of \[all\]
the attainments (cf. S IV 217). But in the four-constituent becoming
there is no arising of the first jhāna, etc., and so it is not possible
to attain it there. But some say that is because of the lack of a
physical basis \[for the mind there\].12



[30.](v) *Why do they attain it*? Being wearied by the
occurrence and dissolution of formations, they attain it thinking, "Let
us dwell in bliss by being without consciousness here and now and
reaching the cessation that is Nibbāna."13



[31.](vi) *How does its attainment come about*? It comes about
in one who performs the preparatory tasks by striving with serenity and
insight and causes the cessation of \[consciousness belonging to\] the
base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception. One who
strives with serenity alone reaches the base consisting of neither
perception nor non-perception and remains there, while one who strives
with insight alone reaches the attainment of fruition and remains there.
But it is one who strives with both, and after performing the
preparatory tasks, causes the cessation of \[consciousness belonging
to\] the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception, who
attains it. This is in brief.



[32.]But the detail is this. When a bhikkhu who desires to
attain cessation has finished all that has to do with his meal and has
washed his hands and feet well, he sits down on a well-prepared seat in
a secluded place. Having folded his legs crosswise, set his body erect,
established mindfulness in front of him, he attains the first jhāna, and
on emerging he sees the formations in it with insight as impermanent,
painful, not-self.



[33.]This insight is threefold as insight that discerns
formations, insight for the attainment of fruition, and insight for the
attainment of cessation. Herein, insight that discerns formations,
whether sluggish or keen, is the proximate cause only for a path.
Insight for the attainment of fruition, which is only valid when keen,
is similar to that for the development of a path. Insight for the
attainment of cessation is only valid when it is not over-sluggish and
not over-keen. Therefore he sees those formations with insight that is
not over-sluggish and not over-keen.



[34.]After that, he attains the second jhāna, and on emerging
he sees formations with insight in like manner. After that, he attains
the third jhāna ... (etc.) ... After that, he attains the base
consisting of boundless consciousness, and on emerging he sees the
formations in it in like manner. Likewise he attains the base consisting



12\. "They say so because of absence of heart-basis; but the meaning is
because of absence of basis called physical body. For if anyone were to
attain cessation in the immaterial worlds he would become indefinable
(*appaññattika*) owing to the non- existence of any consciousness or
consciousness concomitant at all, and he would be as though attained to
final Nibbāna without remainder of results of past clinging; for what
remainder of results of past clinging could be predicated of him when he
had entered into cessation? So it is because of the lack of the
necessary factors that there is no attaining of the attainment of
cessation in the immaterial worlds" (Vism-mhṭ 902).\



13\. "'*Reaching the cessation that is Nibbāna*': as though reaching
Nibbāna without remainder of result of past clinging. 'In bliss' means
without suffering" (Vism-mhṭ 902).

of nothingness. On emerging from that he does the fourfold preparatory
task, that is to say, about (a) non-damage to others' property, (b) the
Community's waiting, (c) the Master's summons, and (d) the limit of the
duration. \[706\]



[35.] (a) Herein, *non-damage to others' property* refers to
what the bhikkhu has about him that is not his personal property: a robe
and bowl, or a bed and chair, or a living room, or any other kind of
requisite kept by him but the property of various others. It should be
resolved14 that such property will not be damaged, will not be destroyed
by fire, water, wind, thieves, rats, and so on. Here is the form of the
resolve: "During these seven days let this and this not be burnt by
fire; let it not be swept off by water; let it not be spoilt by wind;
let it not be stolen by thieves; let it not be devoured by rats, and so
on." When he has resolved in this way, they are not in danger during the
seven days.



[36.]If he does not resolve in this way, they may be destroyed
by fire, etc., as in the case of the Elder Mahā Nāga. The elder, it
seems, went for alms into the village where his mother, a lay follower,
lived. She gave him rice gruel and seated him in the sitting hall. The
elder sat down and attained cessation. While he was sitting there the
hall caught fire. The other bhikkhus each picked up their seats and
fled. The villagers gathered together, and seeing the elder, they said,
"What a lazy monk! What a lazy monk!" The fire burned the grass thatch,
the bamboos, and timbers, and it encircled the elder. People brought
water and put it out. They removed the ashes, did repairs,15 scattered
flowers, and then stood respectfully waiting. The elder emerged at the
time he had determined. Seeing them, he said, "I am discovered!," and he
rose up into the air and went to Piyaṅgu Island. This is "non-damage to
others' property."



[37.] There is no special resolving to be done for what is his
own personal property such as the inner and outer robes or the seat he
is sitting on. He protects all that by means of the attainment itself,
like those of the venerable Sañjīva. And this is said: "There was
success by intervention of concentration in the venerable Sañjīva. There
was success by intervention of concentration in the venerable Sāriputta"
(Paṭis I 212---see XII.30).



[38.] (b)  *The Community's waiting* is the Community's
expecting. The meaning is: till this bhikkhu comes there is no carrying
out of acts of the Community. And here it is not the actual Community's
waiting that is the preparatory task, but the adverting to the waiting.
So it should be adverted to in this way: "While I am sitting for seven
days in the attainment of cessation, if the Community wants to enact a
resolution, etc., I shall emerge before any bhikkhu comes to summon me."
\[707\] One who attains it after doing this emerges at exactly that
time.



14\. "'*It should be resolved*': the thought should be aroused. For here
the resolve consists in arousing the thought. In the non-arising of
consciousness-originated materiality, etc., and in the absence of
support by a postnascence condition, etc., the physical body continues
the same only for seven days; after that it suffers wastage. So he
limits the duration to seven days when he attains cessation, they say"
(Vism-mhṭ 903).\



15\. *Paribhaṇḍa---*"repair work": this meaning is not given in PED; cf.
M-a IV 157 (patching of old robes), and M-a I 291.

[39.]But if he does not do so, then perhaps the Community
assembles, and not seeing him, it is asked, "Where is the bhikkhu so and
so?" They reply, "He has attained cessation." The Community dispatches a
bhikkhu, telling him, "Go and summon him in the name of the Community."
Then as soon as the bhikkhu stands within his hearing and merely says,
"The Community is waiting for you, friend," he emerges. Such is the
importance of the Community's order. So he should attain in such-wise
that, by adverting to it beforehand, he emerges by himself.



[40.](c) *The Master's summons*: here too it is the adverting
to the Master's summons that is the preparatory task. So that also
should be adverted to in this way: "While I am sitting for seven days in
the attainment of cessation, if the Master, after examining a case,
makes known a course of training, or teaches the Dhamma, the origin of
which discourse is some need that has arisen,16 I shall emerge before
anyone comes to summon me." For when he has seated himself after doing
so, he emerges at exactly that time.



[41.]But if he does not do so, when the Community assembles,
the Master, not seeing him, asks, "Where is the bhikkhu so and so?" They
reply, "He has attained cessation." Then he dispatches a bhikkhu,
telling him, "Go and summon him in my name." As soon as the bhikkhu
stands within his hearing and merely says, "The Master calls the
venerable one," he emerges. Such is the importance of the Master's
summons. So he should attain in such wise that, by adverting to it
beforehand, he emerges himself.



[42.] (d)  *The limit of duration* is the limit of life's
duration. For this bhikkhu should be very careful to determine what the
limit of his life's duration is. He should attain only after adverting
in this way: "Will my own vital formations go on occurring for seven
days or will they not?" For if he attains it without adverting when the
vital formations are due to cease within seven days, then since the
attainment of cessation cannot ward off his death because there is no
dying during cessation,17 he consequently emerges from the attainment
meanwhile. So he should attain only after adverting to that. For it is
said that while it may be permissible to omit adverting to others, this
must be adverted to.



[43.] Now, when he has thus attained the base consisting of
nothingness and



emerged and done this preparatory task, he then attains the base
consisting of



16\. The word *atthuppatti* ("the origin being a need arisen") is a
technical commentarial term. "There are four kinds of origins
(*uppatti*) or setting forth of suttas (*sutta- nikkhepa*): on account
of the speaker's own inclination (*attajjhāsaya*), on account of
another's inclination (*parajjhāsaya*), as the result of a question
asked (*pucchāvasika*), and on account of a need arisen
(*atthuppattika*)' (M-a I 15, see also Ch. III.88).



17\. "'*Vital formations*' are the same as 1ife span; though some say
that they are the life span, heat and consciousness. These are the
object only of his normal consciousness. There is no death during
cessation because dying takes place by means of the final life-continuum
\[consciousness\]. He should attain only after adverting thus, 'Let
sudden death not occur.' For in the case of sudden death he would not be
able to declare final knowledge, advise the bhikkhus, and testify to the
Dispensation's power. And there would be no reaching the highest path in
the case of a non-returner" (Vism-mhṭ 904).

neither perception nor non-perception. Then after one or two turns of
consciousness have passed, he becomes without consciousness, he achieves
cessation. But why do consciousnesses not go on occurring in him after
the two consciousnesses? Because the effort is directed to cessation.
For this bhikkhu's mounting through the eight attainments, coupling
together the states of serenity and insight, \[708\] is directed to
successive cessation, not to attaining the base consisting of neither
perception nor non-perception. So it is because the effort is directed
to cessation that no more than the two consciousnesses occur.



[44.]But if a bhikkhu emerges from the base consisting of
nothingness without having done this preparatory task and then attains
the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception, he is
unable then to become without consciousness: he returns to the base
consisting of nothingness and settles down there.



[45.]And here the simile of the man and the road not previously
travelled may be told. A man who had not previously travelled a certain
road came to a ravine cut by water, or after crossing a deep morass he
came to a rock heated by a fierce sun. Then without arranging his inner
and outer garments, he descended into the ravine but came up again for
fear of wetting his belongings and remained on the bank, or he walked up
on to the rock but on burning his feet he returned to the near side and
waited there.



[46.]Herein, just as the man, as soon as he had descended into
the ravine, or walked up on to the hot rock, turned back and remained on
the near side because he had not seen to the arrangement of his inner
and outer garments, so too as soon as the meditator has attained the
base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception, he turns back
and remains in the base consisting of nothingness because the
preparatory task has not been done.



[47.]Just as when a man who has travelled that road before
comes to that place, he puts his inner garment on securely, and taking
the other in his hand, crosses over the ravine, or so acts as to tread
only lightly on the hot rock and accordingly gets to the other side, so
too, when the bhikkhu does the preparatory task and then attains the
base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception, then he
achieves cessation, which is the other side, by becoming without
consciousness.



[48.](vii) *How is it made to last*? It lasts as long as the
time predetermined for its duration, unless interrupted meanwhile by the
exhaustion of the life span, by the waiting of the Community, or by the
Master's summons.



[49.](viii) *How does the emergence from it come about*? The
emergence comes about in two ways thus: by means of the fruition of
non-return in the case of the non- returner, or by means of the fruition
of Arahantship in the case of the Arahant.



[50.](ix) *Towards what does the mind of one who has emerged
tend*? It tends towards Nibbāna. For this is said: "When a bhikkhu has
emerged from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling,
friend Visākha, his consciousness inclines to seclusion, leans to
seclusion, tends to seclusion" (M I 302). \[709\]



[]



[]



[51.] (x)  *What is the difference between one who has attained
and one who is dead*? This is also given in a sutta, according as it is
said: "When a bhikkhu is dead, friend, has completed his term, his
bodily formations have ceased and are quite still, his verbal formations
have ceased and are quite still, his mental formations have ceased and
are quite still, his life is exhausted, his heat has subsided, and his
faculties are broken up. When a bhikkhu has entered upon the cessation
of perception and feeling, his bodily formations have ceased and are
quite still, his verbal formations have ceased and are quite still, his
mental formations have ceased and are quite still, his life is
unexhausted, his heat has not subsided, his faculties are quite whole"
(M I 296).



[52.](xi) *As to the question is the attainment of cessation
formed or unformed, etc*.? It is not classifiable as formed or unformed,
mundane or supramundane. Why? Because it has no individual essence. But
since it comes to be attained by one who attains it, it is therefore
permissible to say that it is produced, not unproduced.18



This too is an attainment which\
A Noble One may cultivate;\
The peace it gives is reckoned as\
Nibbāna here and now.



A wise man by developing\
The noble understanding can\
With it himself endow;\
So this ability is called\
A boon of understanding, too,\
The noble paths allow.



\[D. Worthiness to Receive Gifts\]



[53.] And not only the ability to attain the attainment of
cessation but also achievement of worthiness to receive gifts should be
understood as a benefit of this supramundane development of
understanding.



[54.] For, generally speaking, it is because understanding has
been developed



in these four ways that a person who has developed it, is fit for the
gifts of the



18\. The subtleties of the word *nipphanna* are best cleared up by
quoting a paragraph from the *Sammohavinodanī* (Vibh-a 29): "The five
aggregates are positively-produced (*parinipphanna*) always, not
un-positively-produced (*aparinipphanna*); they are always formed, not
unformed. Besides, they are produced (*nipphanna*) as well. For among
the dhammas that are individual essences (*sabhāva-dhamma*) it is only
Nibbāna that is un-positively-produced and un-produced (*anipphanna*)."
The *Mūla Þīkā* comments on this: "What is the difference between the
positively-produced and the produced? A dhamma that is an individual
essence with a beginning and an end in time, produced by conditions, and
marked by the three characteristics, is *positively produced*. But
besides this, what is *produced* \[but not positively produced\] is a
dhamma with no individual essence (*asabhāva-dhamma*) when it is
produced by the taking of a name or by attaining \[the attainment of
cessation\]" (Vibh-a 23). Cf. also XIV.72 and 77.

world with its deities, fit for its hospitality, fit for its offerings,
and fit for its reverential salutation, and an incomparable field of
merit for the world.



[55.]But in particular, firstly, one who arrives at development
of under-standing of the first path with sluggish insight and limp
faculties is called, "one who will be reborn seven times at most"; he
traverses the round of rebirths seven times in the happy destinies. One
who arrives with medium insight and medium faculties is called, "one who
goes from noble family to noble family"; with two or three rebirths in
noble families he makes an end of suffering. One who arrives with keen
insight and keen faculties is called, "one who germinates only once";
with one rebirth in the human world he makes an end of suffering (see A
I 133).



By developing understanding of the second path, he is called a
once-returner.



He returns once to this world and makes an end of suffering. \[710\]



[56.]By developing understanding of the third path he is called
a non-returner. According to the difference in his faculties he
completes his course in one of five ways after he has left this world:
he becomes "one who attains Nibbāna early in his next existence" or "one
who attains Nibbāna more than half way through his next existence" or
"one who attains Nibbāna without prompting" or "one who attains Nibbāna
with prompting" or "one who is going upstream bound for the Highest
Gods" (see D III 237).



[57.] Herein,  *one who attains Nibbāna early in his next
existence* attains Nibbāna after reappearing anywhere in the Pure
Abodes, without reaching the middle of his life span there. *One who
attains Nibbāna more than half way through his next existence* attains
Nibbāna after the middle of his life span there. One who attains Nibbāna
without prompting generates the highest path without prompting, with
little effort. *One who attains Nibbāna with prompting* generates the
highest path with prompting, with effort. *One who is going upstream
bound for the Highest Gods* passes on upwards from wherever he is reborn
\[in the Pure Abodes\] to the Highest Gods' becoming and attains Nibbāna
there.



[58.]By developing understanding of the fourth path one becomes
"liberated by faith," another "liberated by understanding," another
"both-ways liberated," another "one with the triple clear vision,"
another "one with the six kinds of direct-knowledge," another "one of
the great ones whose cankers are destroyed who has reached the
categories of discrimination." It was about one who has developed the
fourth path that it was said: "But it is at the moment of the path that
he is said to be disentangling that tangle: at the moment of fruition he
has disentangled the tangle and is worthy of the highest offerings in
the world with its deities" (I.7).



[59.] The noble understanding, when Developed, will these
blessings win;\
Accordingly discerning men\
Rejoice exceedingly therein.



[60.]And at this point the development of understanding with
its benefits, which is shown in the *Path of Purification* with its
headings of virtue, concentration, and understanding, in the stanza,



[]



[]



"When a wise man, established well in virtue,\
Develops consciousness and understanding,\
Then as a bhikkhu ardent and sagacious,\
He succeeds in disentangling this tangle" (I.1),\
has been fully illustrated.

CONCLUSION



After we quoted this stanza,



"When a wise man, established well in virtue,\
Develops consciousness and understanding,\
Then as a bhikkhu ardent and sagacious\
He succeeds in disentangling this tangle" (I.1),



we then said:



"My task is now to set out the true sense,\
Divided into virtue and the rest,\
Of this same verse composed by the Great Sage.\
There are here in the Victor's Dispensation\
And who although desiring purity\
Have no right knowledge of the sure straight way---\
Comprising virtue and the other two,\
Right hard to find, that leads to purity---\
Who, though they strive, here gain no purity.\
To them I shall expound the comforting *Path\
Of Purification*, pure in expositions\
Relying on the teaching of the dwellers\
In the Great Monastery; let all those\
Good men who do desire purity\
Listen intently to my exposition." (I.4)



Now, at this point that has all been expounded. And herein:



Now, that the exposition as set forth\
Is almost free from errors and from flaws\
After collating all the expositions\
Of all these meanings classed as virtue and so on\
Stated in the commentarial system\
Of the five Nikāyas---for this reason\
Let meditators pure in understanding\
Desiring purification duly show\
Reverence for this *Path of Purification*.

What store of merit has been gained by me\
Desiring establishment in this Good Dhamma\
In doing this, accepting the suggestion\
Of the venerable Saṅghapāla,\
One born into the line of famous elders\
Dwelling within the Great Monastery,\
A true Vibhajjavādin, who is wise,\
And lives in pure simplicity, devoted\
To discipline's observance, and to practice,\
Whose mind the virtuous qualities of patience,\
Mildness, loving kindness, and so on, grace---\
By the power of that store of merit\
May every being prosper happily.\
And now just as the *Path of Purification*,\
With eight and fifty recitation sections\
In the text, has herewith been completed\
Without impediment, so may all those\
Who in the world depend on what is good\
Glad-hearted soon succeed without delay.



\[POSTSCRIPT\]



This  *Path of Purification* was made by the elder who is adorned with
supreme and pure faith, wisdom and energy, in whom are gathered a
concourse of upright, gentle, etc., qualities due to the practice of
virtue, who is capable of delving into and fathoming the views of his
own and others' creeds, who is possessed of keenness of understanding,
who is strong in unerring knowledge of the Master's Dispensation as
divided into three Piṭakas with their commentaries, a great expounder,
gifted with sweet and noble speech that springs from the ease born of
perfection of the vocal instrument, a speaker of what is appropriately
said, a superlative speaker, a great poet, an ornament in the lineage of
the elders who dwell in the Great Monastery, and who are shining lights
in the lineage of elders with unblemished enlightenment in the
superhuman states that are embellished with the special qualities of the
six kinds of direct-knowledge and the categories of discrimination, who
has abundant purified wit, who bears the name Buddhaghosa conferred by
the venerable ones, and who should be called "of Moraṇḍaceṭaka."



May it continue here to show\
The way to purity of virtue, etc.,\
For clansmen seeking out the means\
To ferry them across the worlds\
For just as long as in this world\
Shall last that name "Enlightened One,"\
By which, thus purified in mind,\
Is known the Greatest Sage, World Chief.

CONCLUSION



\[*The following verses are only in Sinhalese texts*:\]



By the performance of such merit\
As has been gained by me through this\
And any other still in hand\
So may I in my next becoming\
Behold the joys of Tāvatiṃsā,\
Glad in the qualities of virtue\
And unattached to sense desires.\
By having reached the first fruition,\
And having in my last life seen\
Metteyya, Lord of Sages, Highest\
Of persons in the World, and\
Helper Delighting in all beings' welfare,\
And heard that Holy One proclaim\
The Teaching of the Noble Dhamma,\
May I grace the Victor's Dispensation\
By realizing its highest fruit.



\[The following verses are only in the Burmese texts:\]



The exposition of the *Path of Purification\
*Has thus been made for gladdening good people;\
But this, by reckoning the Pali text,\
Has eight and fifty recitation sections.
