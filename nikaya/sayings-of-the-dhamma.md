# The SuttaCentral Editions Series

Since 2005 SuttaCentral has provided access to the texts, translations,
and parallels of early Buddhist texts. In 2018 we started creating and
publishing our translations of these seminal spiritual classics. The
"Editions" series now makes selected translations available as books in
various forms, including print, PDF, and EPUB.

Editions are selected from our most complete, well-crafted, and reliable
translations. They aim to bring these texts to a wider audience in forms
that reward mindful reading. Care is taken with every detail of the
production, and we aim to meet or exceed professional best standards in
every way. These are the core scriptures underlying the entire Buddhist
tradition, and we believe that they deserve to be preserved and made
available in the highest quality without compromise.

SuttaCentral is a charitable organization. Our work is accomplished by
volunteers and through the generosity of our donors. Everything we
create is offered to all of humanity free of any copyright or licensing
restrictions.

# Preface

In 2009 Brian Ashen, the then-president of the Federation of Australia
Buddhist Councils, toured the Federal Parliament of Australia in
Canberra. The tour was shown the Despatch Box, which contained sacred
scriptures when required for oath-taking. This box, which sits in a
place of honor before the Prime Minister, contained a Bible and a Quran.

Brian raised this with the FABC and we agreed to propose a Buddhist
scripture to be placed alongside the scriptures of Christianity and
Islam. Unfortunately, the Tipiṭaka is large, even more so if we consider
the canons of all schools. So we needed to suggest a single text that
would well represent all the Buddhist traditions.

I proposed the Dhammapada. Here is an edited excerpt from my proposal.

> The Dhammapada is one of the ancient texts, spoken, as far as we can
> tell, largely by the historical Buddha, and organized and edited by
> the Sangha of old. We cannot know, of course, that all of the verses
> were spoken as we have them by the Buddha himself, and indeed several
> of them share things in common with Jain or Brahmanical verses.
> Nevertheless, as a historical scholar, I feel that the teachings found
> there are very likely to represent the actual teachings of Siddhattha.
>
> The Dhammapada is not a sectarian document. It is true that the
> best-known version, which I have proposed for inclusion, stems from
> the Theravada school, but this is just an accident of history. This
> particular version happened to have been passed down through the Sri
> Lankan lineage. But many other versions have come down to us.
>
> There are no significant doctrinal differences between these versions.
> They merely choose slightly different readings, some different verses,
> and change the order. It would be a nice gesture to non-sectarianism
> to include one of these texts as well as or instead of the Pali, but I
> am not aware of any suitable translations.
>
> The teachings found in the Dhammapada are those common to all schools.
> They are particularly relevant for lay instruction and are frequently
> used in that way in Buddhist communities. But perhaps even more
> significant, the Dhammapadas are often associated by scholars with
> "Ashokan Buddhism". That is to say, the emphasis on a practical
> application of Dhamma to a good life as found in the Dhammapada, and
> especially the emphasis on non-violence, relates very closely to the
> teachings found in the Ashokan edicts. This means that they are
> particularly suitable for a leader who seeks moral and spiritual
> guidance in the practicalities of life.
>
> Can we imagine, what would a politician do if she happened, on a
> difficult night in Parliament, to seek some solace from the religious
> texts found there? She opens the box, is delighted to see a Buddhist
> text, and, having heard that Buddhism is a rational religion of ethics
> and meditation, opens a random page. What does she find?
>
> *Hatred is never appeased by hatred, hatred is only ever appeased by
> love: this is an ancient law.*

Happily, my proposal was accepted. We approached the Pali Text Society,
who kindly donated a hardcover edition of K.R. Norman's excellent
analytical translation. And on the 15th of September 2009, I was proud
to be part of the Buddhist delegation that met with the Speaker of the
House, who accepted our copy of the Dhammapada and placed it in the
Despatch Box, where it remains to this day.

</nav>

The Dhammapada is, in terms of sequence, the second collection in the
Pali Khuddhaka Nikāya; but in terms of fame and popularity, it is,
without any competitor, the first. It consists of 423 verses arranged in
thematic chapters. Its powerful, engaging, and evocative verses have
ensured its popularity from ancient times until now.

The Dhammapada is closely allied to the Udāna, and I refer you to my
essay there for the relation between these texts. Many of the verses of
the Dhammapada can be found elsewhere in the Pali Canon and are also
widely shared across traditions. They are not restricted to Buddhist
texts either, for they may also be found occasionally in the law books
of Manu, in the Mahābhārata, in Jaina sutras, and in the Sanskrit
collection of fables, the Pañcatantra. The special quality of the
Dhammapada lies not in any doctrinal innovations, but in the appealing
and meaningful selection and arrangement of verses by topic.

There are at least twelve versions of the Dhammapada, far more than any
comparable ancient Buddhist text. They exist in Pali, Sanskrit, Prākrit,
Gandhārī, Tibetan, and no less than four Chinese translations. The study
of this large and linguistically-diverse mass of texts reveals much of
how Buddhist texts were compiled and later translated. All differences
aside, however, the texts share not just a name, but an overall
structure and style, and many individual verses and lines of verse.

While the Dhammapada deservedly has a reputation for its practical and
accessible nature, it is by no means a watered-down version of the
Dhamma. It contains some of the most enigmatic and profound teachings of
the Pali canon, and like all early Buddhist teachings, challenges our
desires and assumptions to the core. It grants the reader, the
practitioner, and the audience, the foremost place in realizing its
truths, acknowledging that its words alone are not enough. And as such,
it reveals the deep love and compassion that lie at the heart of the
Buddha's teaching, his profound conviction that freedom is possible, and
that we have what it takes.

## What Others Have Said {#introduction.xhtml_what-others-have-said}

Many words have been written in eulogy of the Dhammapada's qualities,
and I can do no better than quote them. In the Preface to his
translation, Ven. Buddharakkhita says:

> The contents of the verses, however, transcend the limited and
> particular circumstances of their origin, reaching out through the
> ages to various types of people in all the diverse situations of life.
> For the simple and unsophisticated the Dhammapada is a sympathetic
> counselor; for the intellectually overburdened its clear and direct
> teachings inspire humility and reflection; for the earnest seeker it
> is a perennial source of inspiration and practical instruction.

And Bhikkhu Bodhi, in his introduction to the same translation, says:

> It is an ever-fecund source of themes for sermons and discussions, a
> guidebook for resolving the countless problems of everyday life, and a
> primer for the instruction of novices in the monasteries. Even the
> experienced contemplative, withdrawn to a forest hermitage or
> mountainside cave for a life of meditation, can be expected to count a
> copy of the book among his few material possessions. Yet the
> admiration the Dhammapada has elicited has not been confined to avowed
> followers of Buddhism. Wherever it has become known its moral
> earnestness, realistic understanding of human life, aphoristic wisdom,
> and stirring message of a way to freedom from suffering have won for
> it the devotion and veneration of those responsive to the good and the
> true.

He proposes a four-fold scheme for understanding the aims of the diverse
teachings found in the Dhammapada.

1.  Happiness in this life.
2.  Happiness in the next life.
3.  The path to freedom from suffering.
4.  Celebrations of freedom.

These are not incompatible purposes, but rather build on each other. He
goes on to give a detailed analysis of the doctrinal content of the
verses seen through this framework.

While some commentators have tended to tame and blandify the teachings
of the Dhammapada, not so Albert Edmunds, whose 1902 translation
`<cite>`{=html}Hymns of the Faith`</cite>`{=html} was one of the
earliest into English, and whose introduction remains perhaps the most
dramatic:

> If ever an immortal classic was produced upon the continent of Asia,
> it was this. ... No trite ephemeral songs are here, but red-hot lava
> from the abysses of the human soul ... These old refrains from a life
> beyond time and sense, as it was wrought out by generations of earnest
> thinkers, have been fire in many a muse. They burned in the brains of
> the Chinese pilgrims, who braved the blasts of the Mongolian desert,
> climbed the cliffs of the Himalayas, swung by rope-bridges across the
> Indus where it rages through its gloomiest gorge, and faced the bandit
> and beast, to peregrinate the Holy Land of their religion and tread in
> the footsteps of their Master.

His description of the travails endured by the ancient Chinese pilgrims
in search of the Dhamma is in no way exaggerated, and it serves as a
timely reminder to us, in our age of lazy access to the world's
information, that some forms of wisdom are truly rare and priceless, and
worth putting in effort.

The renowned meditation teacher Daw Mya Tin, known as Mother Sayamagyi,
when introducing her 1984 translation on behalf of the Burma Pitaka
Association under the title `<cite>`{=html}The Dhammapada: Verses and
Stories`</cite>`{=html} notes the prevalence of the Dhammapada in
Burmese Buddhism:

> Through these verses, the Buddha exhorts one to achieve that greatest
> of all conquests, the conquest of self; to escape from the evils of
> passion, hatred, and ignorance; and to strive hard to attain freedom
> from craving and freedom from the round of rebirths. Each verse
> contains a truth (dhamma), an exhortation, a piece of advice. ... In
> Burma, translations have been made into Burmese, mostly in prose, some
> with paraphrases, explanations, and abridgments of stories relating to
> the verses. In recent years, some books on Dhammapada with both
> Burmese and English translations, together with Pali verses, have also
> been published.

Ṭhānissaro Bhikkhu applies the aesthetic theories of later Indian
philosophy to analyze the literary qualities of the Dhammapada, arguing
that it aims "to instruct in the highest ends of life while
simultaneously giving delight."

Ānandajoti Bhikkhu has studied the Dhammapada literature extensively, in
both Pali and other Indic languages. In the introduction to his
translation, he says:

> The timeless ethical teachings contained in these verses are still
> considered relevant to people's lives, and they are a good guide to
> living well, and show how to reap the rewards of good living. ... The
> verses and stories are well known in traditional Theravāda Buddhist
> cultures, and most born and brought up in those societies will be able
> to recite many of the verses, and relate the stories that go with
> them, even from a young age.

As a jewel of Indian literature, the Dhammapada has been widely
translated and commented on by Indian pundits. The celebrated Hindu
scholar and second president of India, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, in the
Preface to his revised edition of 1950, approaches the Dhammapada from a
deeply humanistic perspective:

> The effort to build one world requires a closer understanding among
> the peoples of the world and their cultures. This translation of the
> Dhammapada, the most popular and influential book of Buddhist
> canonical literature, is offered as a small contribution to world
> understanding. The central thesis of the book---that human conduct,
> righteous behavior, reflection, and meditation are more important than
> vain speculations about the transcendent---has an appeal to the modern
> mind. Its teaching---to repress the instincts entirely is to generate
> neuroses; to give them full rein is also to end up in neuroses---is
> supported by modern psychology. Books so rich in significance as the
> Dhammapada require to be understood by each generation in relation to
> its own problems.

Eknath Easwaran, a Hindu yogi and scholar, is less circumspect in his
approach. While quoting widely from Brahmanical scriptures in his
introduction, he does not hesitate to claim that, "if everything else
were lost, we would need nothing more than the Dhammapada to follow the
way of the Buddha." It's a debatable claim; but what is not debatable is
that, were we to lose all other Dhamma, that would include all the many
places the Buddha criticized Brahmanism, its rituals, texts, beliefs,
and practices.

This is the downside of the "context collapse" in the Dhammapada: it is
one thing to enjoy the Dhamma in the form of delightful bon mots; it is
quite another to reduce it to nothing more than that. The Dhammapada
serves well as an introduction to the Buddha's teaching and as an
inspiring reminder for experienced practitioners, but it is no
replacement for the detailed and careful presentations of the Buddha's
path found in the prose suttas.

As if to illustrate this point, Easwaran goes on to say that the
Dhammapada is a guide to "nothing less than the highest goal life can
offer: Self-realization." He does not notice that "self-realization" is
nowhere mentioned in the Dhammapada, nor is it a goal of Buddhism. The
goal of the Dhammapada is freedom from suffering, as it is for all
Buddhism. A careful study of the prose Suttas might have helped him to
draw the Buddha's message from the text, instead of reading his own
ideas into it.

Despite his evident preconceptions, Easwaran is sincere in his approach.
But not all those who comment on the Dhammapada do so from a place of
learning or wisdom. A notorious cult leader like Osho cannot help but
reveal his nature in the way he introduces his commentary.

> My beloved Bodhisattvas ... You are bodhisattvas because of your
> longing to be conscious ... And THE DHAMMAPADA, the teaching of
> Gautama the Buddha, can only be taught to the bodhisattvas. It cannot
> be taught to the ordinary, mediocre humanity, because it cannot be
> understood by them.

The Buddha never spoke in this way, aiming to divide and separate,
creating an egoistic in-group with special access to the truth. These
are the ways of a con artist, and they show how readily and how swiftly
the Dhamma may be turned into an instrument of manipulation, a tool in
the hands of a grifter.

This little survey is remiss in that so far it has mentioned only men,
while women have also made major contributions to the study of the
Dhammapada. Caroline A.F. Rhys Davids, then president of the Pali Text
Society, translated the Dhammapada as `<cite>`{=html}Verses on
Dhamma`</cite>`{=html} in volume 1 of `<cite>`{=html}The Minor
Anthologies of the Pali Canon`</cite>`{=html} in 1931. In 1997, Anne
Bancroft together with Thomas Byrom published a translation through
Element Books. And in Spanish, the erudite Argentinian philosopher
Carmen Dragonetti published `<cite>`{=html}La enseñanza de
Buda`</cite>`{=html} in 2002, which went on to become one of the most
popular renderings.

For a popular edition that is reliable and accessible, Valerie J
Roebuck, an accomplished scholar of Sanskrit and Pali, as well as an
experienced meditator, published a verse translation through Penguin in
2010 under the title `<cite>`{=html}The Dhammapada`</cite>`{=html}. A
review by Elizabeth Harris described it as "a gem ... energetic and
direct ... I do not know a version of this text that is so comprehensive
and informative, both for the general reader and the scholar"
(`<cite>`{=html}Religions of South Asia`</cite>`{=html} 6.1, 2012).

The Dhammapada has also stimulated a wide variety of creative responses.
These began with the commentary itself, which paints a vivid if
sometimes unlikely picture of the circumstances of the verses.
Illustrated editions sometimes render these stories or else pair the
verses with more evocative images. There are at least two musical
settings of the Dhammapada, and many individual verses have been set to
song.

A forthcoming novel, `<cite>`{=html}The Lyrebird's Cry`</cite>`{=html}
by Samantha Sirimanne Hyde, begins each chapter with a quotation from
the Dhammapada, in a manner that deliberately evokes the traditional
manner of sermon-giving. The story tells of a "sensitive" young Sri
Lankan man living in Sydney who is forced into an arranged marriage with
a "good girl" from Colombo---despite the inconvenient fact that he is
gay. It highlights the heartlessness that can so often underlie a pious
adherence to the maxims of a sacred text.

## On Translations of the Dhammapada {#introduction.xhtml_on-translations-of-the-dhammapada}

There are countless modern translations of the Dhammapada, and more than
any other Pali text it is available and widely read: in massive
illustrated coffee-table books, in cute inspirational booklets, in audio
or on the web, or quoted on throw-pillows or coffee-mugs. There seems
little need for another translation; indeed, for many decades now it has
been a convention when introducing a new translation of the Dhammapada
to apologize for its existence.

Yet if the proliferation of Dhammapada translations gives you the idea
that it is a simple text that anyone can translate, consider the
following. In the introduction to his translation of the Dhammapada for
the Pali Text Society (PTS), Professor K.R. Norman---the greatest modern
linguist of ancient Indic languages---said this in reference to the
editor of the Gandhārī Dhammapada:

> John Brough is reported as saying, when asked if he would produce a
> new translation of the Dhammapada for the PTS, that he could not
> because it was "too difficult". I regret to say that I must agree with
> him. My notes reveal how often I was quite unsure about the meaning of
> a verse.

Now, notwithstanding the fact that academics have a stricter standard
for confidence than most people, the fact remains that the Dhammapada is
by no means an easy or beginner's text. Given that the greatest
linguists of the field quail before the challenge of translating the
Dhammapada, one might wonder at the degree of expertise brought to the
task by the countless "translators" who have expressed no such qualms.

I am being coy here, so let me be plain. The vast majority of so-called
"translations" of the Dhammapada are made by people unqualified to do
so. They merely rehash old versions, leaving out what they find
disagreeable, and rephrasing things to sound "poetic"---by which they
mean inoffensive and unchallenging. Where the Buddha spoke with
specificity, they gesture vaguely to universality. In the process, the
translations become a more reliable guide to the ideological priors of
the "translators" than they are to anything that the Buddha taught.
Such, sad to say, are most of the popular Dhammapadas that you might
purchase through major publishing houses, or learn from various gurus or
teachers.

Any new translation must be, in part, a dialogue with older versions,
which exist both as texts on a page and as echoes in memory. And when
writing, it is not just the translation that matters, but its reception:
translators are in dialogue with both other translators and with
readers. Sometimes we draw from what they have done, sometimes, we look
at things from a fresh angle, and sometimes we try to correct old
errors.

In my translation, I try to remain as close as possible to the meaning
of the text, while believing that readability does not compromise
accuracy. On the contrary, it is through natural and idiomatic diction
that the meaning is most reliably conveyed. I aim for transparency in
translation; it is the Buddha's words, not mine, that matter. And I am
someone who finds beauty in things that are raw and natural, so I don't
sand down rough edges.

All these qualities you might find in other translations, but in one
thing my translation is unique: consistency with the rest of the Suttas.
Since I undertook the Dhammapada as part of my overall translation
project, I have tried as best I can to ensure that renderings make sense
in different contexts. That doesn't mean they must be identical
everywhere, but it does mean that where context is lacking in the
Dhammapada itself, renderings can often be informed by their occurrence
elsewhere. The very first lines of the Dhammapada are a good example of
this, for they echo a short prose passage in the Aṅguttara Nikāya (see
below).

## The Commentary {#introduction.xhtml_the-commentary}

According to the traditions, each of the verses of the Dhammapada was
spoken by the Buddha in response to a specific circumstance. In the Pali
tradition, these background stories are preserved in the commentary
edited and compiled by Buddhaghosa perhaps 800 years after the Buddha,
based on much older texts. The stories are of mixed provenance. Many of
them are late in origin. But the tradition of framing verses in a
narrative context dates from the earliest times, and there is no reason
to doubt that at least some of the stories preserve genuine historical
details.

I'll just make two observations regarding the commentary from my
experience as a teacher. First, many Theravadins, hearing these stories
many times since childhood, assume that they are "Suttas", with no
concept of the fact that they stem from centuries after the Buddha's
life. At the very least, we should be able to distinguish between Sutta
and commentary. And second, when I taught a class, firstly just the
verses, and then the verses with stories, the students universally said
they preferred the verses without the stories. So the idea that the
stories make the verses more meaningful or accessible doesn't
necessarily hold up in practice.

None of this, of course, is to question the inestimable value that the
commentary holds for any translator. Like all Pali verse, the Dhammapada
abounds in tricky idioms and difficult syntax, and the commentary stands
by like a good friend ready to help the lonely and beleaguered scholar
in time of need. No serious scholar would discount the value of the
commentaries in making our modern understanding of the Pali texts
possible.

## The Title {#introduction.xhtml_the-title}

Both elements of the word *dhammapada* can convey different meanings,
and as a result, translators have come up with a bewildering variety of
renderings. *Dhamma* means "teachings, principles, the good, virtue,
phenomena, justice" etc., and *pada* means "foot, footprint, track,
step, word, passage, line of verse, state". In such cases, the sense of
words cannot be simply derived from combining the elements; rather, let
us look at how it is used in the Pali canon itself.

The title Dhammapada does not feature among the nine sections of the
early teachings (*navaṅgadhamma*). The word *dhammapada* however does
appear in the early texts, with two primary meanings.

In [AN 4.30](https://suttacentral.net/an4.30/en/sujato) the Buddha
speaks to a group of wanderers, naming three leaders as Annabhāra,
Varadhara, and Sakuludāyī. He describes them as "very well known",
although they are, as it turns out, only referred to a couple of times
elsewhere in the canon ([MN
77](https://suttacentral.net/mn77/en/sujato), [AN
4.185](https://suttacentral.net/an4.185/en/sujato)). Here he declares
that there are four *dhammapadas* that are ancient and uncontested. He
names them contentment, goodwill, right mindfulness, and right immersion
in *samādhi*. He argues that a spiritual practitioner must respect these
four, and that one who does not can be legitimately criticized.

In this context, then, I have translated *dhammapada* as "basic
principle". Clearly, it has no direct connection with the book named
Dhammapada, although one might detect a distant kinship, given that the
Dhammapada also consists of teachings that are, by and large, "basic
principles" that speak to people across boundaries of religion and sect.
In [DN 33:1.11.138](https://suttacentral.net/dn33/en/sujato#1.11.138) we
find the same four *dhammapadas* listed in summary, and they recur in
later texts such as [Pe
1.1:411.1](https://suttacentral.net/ps1.1/pli/ms#411.1), [Ne
37:390.3](https://suttacentral.net/ne37/pli/ms#390.3) and [Pe
2:144.1](https://suttacentral.net/pe2/pli/ms#144.1).

A quite different sense is found at [SN
9.10](https://suttacentral.net/sn9.10/en/sujato), where a mendicant is
admonished by a deity for no longer reciting the Dhamma as they did in
the past. In the verses, the deity uses the term *dhammapada* which here
must mean something like "passages of the teaching". The same sense
applies at [SN 10.6](https://suttacentral.net/sn10.6/en/sujato). A
similar sense is found at [MN
12:62.10](https://suttacentral.net/mn12/en/sujato#62.10), where it is
said that the Buddha would never run out of ways of explaining the
Dhamma, here said to be *dhammapadabyañjanaṁ*, "words and phrases of the
teachings". At [Snp
1.5:6.1](https://suttacentral.net/snp1.5/en/sujato#6.1) we find
*dhammapade sudesite* which seems to have a similar meaning. The same
phrase occurs in the Dhammapada itself ([Dhp
44](https://suttacentral.net/dhp44/en/sujato), [Dhp
45](https://suttacentral.net/dhp45/en/sujato)). At [SN
1.33:19.2](https://suttacentral.net/sn1.33/en/sujato#19.2) the
*dhammapada* is said to excel even generosity; here it seems to mean the
"way of the teaching".

Turning now to later texts, the same meaning is found in [Ja
424](https://suttacentral.net/ja424/pli/ms), where the gift of
*dhammapada* excels the highest of worldly gifts. In [Ja
532](https://suttacentral.net/ja532/pli/ms), on the other hand,
*dhammapada* occurs during a discussion of the debt owed to parents and
appears to mean "the path of duty".

Finally the Dhammapada itself is referred to by name twice in the
Milindapañha ([Mil
7.3.8:1.5](https://suttacentral.net/mil7.3.8/pli/ms#1.5), [Mil
7.7.3:1.6](https://suttacentral.net/mil7.7.3/pli/ms#1.6)). The verses
quoted do appear in the Pali Dhammapada ([Dhp
327](https://suttacentral.net/dhp327/en/sujato), [Dhp
32](https://suttacentral.net/dhp32/en/sujato); the latter also appears
at [AN 4.37:8.1](https://suttacentral.net/an4.37/en/sujato#8.1)). So we
know that the Pali Dhammapada in its current form must have existed no
later than the creation of the Milindapañha. We don't know the exact
date of that, but it must have been after the time of King Menander (2nd
century BCE).

Thus in the early texts we find the senses "basic principles" and
"statements of the teaching". The first is rather restricted and seems
to apply only in the case of the four stated principles, which
themselves are a statement of common ground between religions, rather
than a presentation of the Buddha's path. It seems, then, that the
second meaning applies in this case. "Sayings of the Dhamma" is an apt
title for a work that gathers pithy verses from various places.

Commentators ancient and modern have drawn attention to a variety of
more meaningful implications than the rather staid "Sayings of the
Dhamma". Since a *pada* is a footprint and the *dhamma* is the truth, it
might mean "tracks of truth"---the traces that the Buddha's insight into
reality have left in the world. Or, since a series of footprints is a
path, and the *dhamma* is the "good", it could be the "path to virtue".
As a translator, I need to focus on the primary literary sense that is
justified by the text, but as a teacher and practitioner, I also
appreciate the way that wordplay can enrich the nuances and implications
of a simple title.

## Formation of the Dhammapada {#introduction.xhtml_formation-of-the-dhammapada}

In his introduction, K.R. Norman suggests that, while the Dhammapada
borrows from elsewhere in the canon, it may also be true that the
canonical texts generally borrowed from a store of relatively
free-floating verses that predate the canon as we know it. Some such
verses may even predate the Buddha.

The Buddha himself is recorded as quoting from pre-Buddhist verses on
occasion, and it is true that, while the verses of the Dhammapada are in
harmony with Buddhist teachings, many of them do not mention
specifically Buddhist ideas and would be equally at home in any of the
ancient Indian religions. The same may be said, it is worth noting, of
the prose Suttas. Countless Suttas teach ethics or meditation or even
philosophy in ways that do not assume a basis in basic Buddhist
doctrines. This reflects the fact that the Buddha spoke to a diverse
audience that often included non-Buddhists. We've already seen that the
four *dhammapadas* were taught specially to emphasize the common ground
between religions, and it may be that this idea influenced the selection
of verses for the Dhammapada.

It seems likely to me that the genre of Dhammapada literature is
associated with the popularization and spread of Buddhism in India, and
especially with its adoption as the mainstream religion of the great
emperor Ashoka. The flavor of the Dhammapada resonates closely with the
tenor of Ashoka's edicts, with its emphasis on practical teachings that
are universally applicable, and a special interest in harmony and
non-violence. I suspect that the Dhammapada collections were created, or
at least popularized and expanded, in the Ashokan era, drawing on
existing verses, and forming a handy and accessible way to bring the
Dhamma to a much broader audience. In other words, its modern usage as
an attractive access point to the Dhamma for Buddhists and non-Buddhists
alike is precisely the reason why it was created in the first place.

## The Teachings of the Dhammapada {#introduction.xhtml_the-teachings-of-the-dhammapada}

Rather than a general overview of the teachings of the Dhammapada, which
has been well undertaken by many previously, I will introduce the
meaning of the text through the close study of a few verses in the
opening chapters. In this way, I'd like to suggest that, while the text
may be read as an inspiring source of spiritual quotations, or as a
verse summary of the Buddha's doctrines, it may also be read as a
carefully composed work of spiritual literature, one that repays careful
attention to details, and which contains the keys to its own
interpretation.

The Dhammapada announces its primary theme in its opening verses. As so
often, lines that appear clear and simple in Pali turn out to be
surprisingly difficult to catch exactly in English. A classic rendering,
endlessly requoted, is:

> Mind is the forerunner of all things.

It's curiously difficult to locate the originator of this phrasing. Ven.
Buddhadatta in 1922 had "Mind is the forerunner of all mental states",
Ven. Nārada (1946) has "Mind is the forerunner of (all evil) states",
while Caroline A.F. Rhys Davids has "Things are forerun by mind" (1931).
The indefatigable Bodhipaksa---whose site "Fake Buddha Quotes" is
essential---has traced this phrasing to an essay by Ven. Vajirañāṇa
called `<cite>`{=html}The Importance of Thought in
Buddhism`</cite>`{=html} (Maha-bodhi vol. 49, May/June 1941). Like so
many after him, he presents this translation without naming his source,
so we do not know whether the rendering was his or if it was already
common parlance. Ven. Vajirañāṇa was famed not only for his erudition
but for his skill in presenting Dhamma in an accessible and relevant way
for a modern audience. He was, in fact, the inventor of the modern
Dhamma talk, and pioneered the practice of giving a focused and thorough
exposition of a specific verse or topic in a limited time. Such talks
would frequently begin by quoting a verse from the Dhammapada. So, while
I have not been able to identify a Dhammapada translation by Ven.
Vajirañāṇa, it is entirely possible that he developed his own renderings
while giving teachings, that he referred to these in his writings, and
that they made their way into the Buddhist zeitgeist through his many
students who became teachers in their own right.

But let us leave aside questions of authorship and focus on the text.
The "all" here does not appear in the text, but is justified by the
closely related passage at [AN
1.56:1.1](https://suttacentral.net/an1.56/en/sujato#1.1), where "all"
unskilful qualities are said to have mind as the forerunner. The tricky
terms here, however, are *mano* ("mind") and *dhamma*. As we have seen
with the title of the collection, the openness of the text has invited a
range of renderings. But it is possible to narrow down the sense from a
careful reading of the text in light of the full range of early
teachings.

The verses are about cause and effect. By acting badly, suffering will
come, while by acting well, happiness will follow. That much is clear.

The pair of terms *mano* and *dhamma* are found together in the standard
exposition of the sixth kind of consciousness, mind consciousness.
There, *mano* is the basis of *mano*-consciousness in the same way that
the "eye" (etc.) is the basis of "eye-consciousness" (etc.). Here *mano*
is usually rendered as "mind". In this context, *dhamma* means the
phenomena of which the mind is aware, and is typically rendered as
"phenomena", "thought", or "mind object" (though I dislike that
rendering).

It's not clear, however, that this sense pertains here, for we are not
speaking of the process of consciousness, but the creation of kamma. Of
the many words for "mind" in Pali, *mano* often conveys the specific
sense of "intentionality". *Mano* is the active dimension of mind, the
exercise of choice in performing morally potent deeds. And surely that
must be the sense required here.

*Dhamma* must then refer to the experiences of pleasure and pain that
are formed by the deed. The passage at [AN
1.56:1.1](https://suttacentral.net/an1.56/en/sujato#1.1) makes it clear
that *mano* is not apart from the *dhammas*, but is one of them (*tesaṁ
dhammānaṁ*). So a rendering like "at the forefront" would be better than
"precedes".

Even though the context makes it clear that ethical intention is the
subject, the opening line invites an "idealist" interpretation so long
as *mano* is rendered with "mind". The Buddha, however, is emphasizing
the creative power of the mind in the world, rather than postulating
that the entire world is nothing more than a projection of the mind. So
I opted to emphasize the aspect of intention while clarifying that
*dhamma* refers to a person's experiences rather than to all "things" in
general.

> Intention shapes experiences.

That's a lot of work to establish just one line, and you will be
delighted to know that I won't be discussing every line in so much
detail. But what is interesting is how this line functions as a
meta-comment on the text itself. How you experience the Dhammapada
depends on what you bring to it. It is not an objective reality to which
one must become subject, but a living provocation. This is why the
Dhamma cannot be forced on anyone, and why someone encountering Dhamma
with a "fault-finding mind" (*uparambhacitta*) will never understand it.

And while it's true that *mano* conveys the primary sense of
"intentionality", it's also true that the sense is broader than merely
"volition": it implies a whole-hearted commitment to understanding, a
unity of intellect and emotion and sensibility. Wisdom arises from a
peaceful and clear mind, and from critical inquiry when it is supported
by faith. But it will come, though slower perhaps than we would like,
and only if we are patient and humble enough to let it reveal itself to
us.

The text immediately proceeds, as if impelled by the opening lines, to
illustrate the point in a dazzling series of verses, each pair of which
draw out a particular example of just how the mind creates suffering or
happiness.

The second series of verses, which is really two pairs on the same
theme, is almost as famous as the opening, and justly so.

> For never is hatred\
> settled by hate,\
> it's only settled by love

The last verse in this series ([Dhp
6](https://suttacentral.net/dhp6/en/sujato)) invites two quite different
renderings, depending on whether *yamāmase* is read with the root *yam*
as "restrained" or, per the commentary, as a reference to Yama the god
of the dead. The latter leads to such renderings as Buddharakkhita's:

> There are those who do not realize\
> that one day we all must die.

Although enjoying the support of the commentary, it is a double-stretch:
*yama* is not used in this way elsewhere, and to introduce death here is
a dramatic shift.

While the verb *yamāmase* seems to be only found in this context and
this unusual form (3rd plural middle imperative), it's a common Pali
idiom to say that one should be "restrained" (*saṁyama*) regarding
harming living creatures. We even find this in the very same verb form:
*pāṇesu ca saṁyamāmase* ([SN
10.6:3.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn10.6/en/sujato#3.1)). This option
doesn't lack commentarial support, either, for an alternate explanation
speaks of not amplifying conflicts that have arisen in the Sangha.

This reading has been adopted by linguistically-minded translators such
as K.R. Norman and Ven. Ānandajoti, and I follow suit.

> Others don't understand\
> that here we need to be restrained.

This is a useful detail to bear in mind when comparing different
translations. Older translations, especially those that cleave more
closely to the traditional explanation, tend to use the sense of "death"
here, while modern translations prefer "restraint".

The final pair of verses undercut the authority of Buddhist texts
themselves, arguing that one who does not practice is like "a cowherd
who counts the cattle of others", while even one of little learning may
realize the truth. Here the Dhammapada is making a meta-comment on how
to read the Dhammapada, drawing out the implication in the first verses.

That the unified character of the first chapter is no accident is borne
out by a consideration of the second chapter, on heedfulness or
diligence (*appamāda*). Here we open with an echo of the pairs of the
first chapter, contrasting the heedless with the heedful.

The opening lines are, once again, not as easy to translate as they
might appear, and they offer us another litmus test to understand the
perspective of different translators.

Commonly we find something like:

> Heedfulness is the path to the deathless.

Now, that the "deathless" (*amata*) refers to Nibbāna is not in dispute.
Nibbāna is "deathless" because it is free from the cycle of
transmigration through birth, old age, and death.

The tricky part is *pada*. The commentary glosses it with *upāyo maggo*
"the way, the path" and this is followed by many translators. While
*pada* doesn't literally mean "path", it is used in the sense of
"footprint", hence "tracks", hence a path to follow. The elephant's
footprint is sometimes used as an example of following such tracks.

The problem is that in canonical Pali, while this exact phrase doesn't
appear elsewhere, the "deathless" *pada*, like the *pada* of Nibbāna, is
not "followed" but "reached" ([Tha-ap
415:11.4](https://suttacentral.net/tha-ap415/pli/ms#11.4), [Tha-ap
395:24.4](https://suttacentral.net/tha-ap395/pli/ms#24.4), [Tha-ap
340:17.4](https://suttacentral.net/tha-ap340/pli/ms#17.4)) or
"understood" ([Bv 1:68.4](https://suttacentral.net/bv1/pli/ms#68.4)). It
must, then, refer to the "state" of the deathless, not the path to it.

This is doctrinally challenging, since heedfulness is a practice, and
normally the texts are quite scrupulous to distinguish the practice from
the fruit. The "path" is said to be the best of conditioned things ([AN
5.32:4.1](https://suttacentral.net/an5.32/en/sujato#4.1)) because it
leads to Nibbāna, not because it *is* Nibbāna, which is the only
"unconditioned" reality.

Despite this, however, the second half of the same verse makes it quite
clear that this unlikely sense is exactly what is meant:

> The heedful do not die

That this, and by extension the whole verse, are spoken with a
metaphorical force is clarified by the inclusion of *yathā* in the last
line:

> while the heedless are like the dead.

This gives us an idea of the subtle shifts in the text as explained by
the commentary and back-read into the texts by translators. It's a
normalizing reading, smoothing the craggy text so that it is more easily
reconciled with the systematic doctrines of the prose. The original is,
to my mind, more powerful and dramatic precisely because it says
something unexpected. What exactly can it mean to say that heedfulness
is the state of deathlessness?

The commentary, of course, is no stranger to metaphor and is quite happy
to draw out metaphors where needed. Yet anyone familiar with traditional
religious communities will recognize the way that playful and
metaphorical scriptures are flattened and reduced by the dead hand of
literalism, stripped of wit and nuance, driven by the fear that someone
might not understand things correctly.

Once again, I see a meta-purpose in the arrangement of the text. The
verse that invokes heedfulness is itself easily misread by the heedless.
Heedfulness is more than just the path to the Deathless, it is itself a
state of life, of active and vital response to the moment, of a
continual reassessment and questioning of assumptions. The chapter
deliberately opens with a verse that wakes the reader, even, and perhaps
especially, one who is already versed in Buddhist doctrine.

As with the first chapter, a series of striking verses draw out the
theme from various angles, but the force of the opening verses is
revisited in the closing. One who loves diligence cannot fall back from
the path but is in the very presence of Nibbāna. Here again, the line
between metaphor and reality is deliberately blurred by the text as if
exceeding the limits of words.

I'll leave my reading of the text there. Hopefully, this is enough to
show that the poetic strength of the text is not diminished by a close
reading, but rather, that it allows hidden nuances and unexpected
implications to reveal themselves. There is more to poetry than a
wording that sounds nice, and more to teaching Dhamma than restating
standard doctrines.

## A Brief Textual History {#introduction.xhtml_a-brief-textual-history}

The first 255 verses of the Dhammapada were translated by Daniel John
Gogerly and published in the journal "The Friend" in Colombo in 1840. It
was among the first translations of Pali into English. This is how he
rendered the first verse:

> Mind precedes action. The motive is chief: actions precede from mind.
> If anyone speak or act from a corrupt mind, suffering will follow the
> action, as the wheel follows the lifted foot of the ox.

The 1855 edition edited by Viggo Fausbøll and published as
`<cite>`{=html}Dhammapadam`</cite>`{=html} was perhaps the first of all
canonical Pali texts published in book form and in Roman characters. (It
had been preceded by editions of the Mahāvaṁsa---the great chronicle of
Sri Lanka---by Eugène Burnouf in 1826 and George Turnour in 1837.) He
also supplied excerpts from the commentary, with textual apparatus and
literal translation both in Latin. For his text, Fausbøll relied
primarily on three manuscripts in Sinhalese characters held at the Great
Royal Library of Copenhagen. He introduced verse numbers, which were
adopted by later editions and are still in use today. At such an early
date, the means of Romanizing Pali had not yet been standardized, but
the text remains clear and readable.

This was updated in 1900 and republished via Luzac & Co. under the
title, `<cite>`{=html}The Dhammapada, Being a Collection of Moral Verses
in Pali`</cite>`{=html}. Fausbøll notes several editions since his 1855
edition, in Sinhalese, Thai, and Burmese characters, as well as several
new translations in various languages.

As an aside, Fausbøll remarks that the Thai characters are difficult to
read, and argues that the Roman characters will become universal,
advancing the curious opinion that English likewise will be the
universal language "for it is a well-known fact that in the beginning
the Lord took all languages, boiled them in a pot, and forthwith
extracted the English language as the essence of them all." I felt I had
to mention this because it is rare in studies of Pali manuscripts to
find evidence of a sense of humor!

As regards the Thai characters, it is noteworthy that, while printed
Thai has become a perfectly readable script, it is nonetheless the case
that the Mahāsaṅgīti edition, which is used by SuttaCentral, was
published by a Thai consortium purely in Roman characters. This was
because they had become frustrated with the mispronunciation of Pali in
Thailand, caused by the fact that the same letter sometimes has a
different value in Thai and Pali. The same is true of Pali written in
other local scripts, and while Pali scholars are well aware of the
issues, it is still the case that not only are Pali words often
mispronounced, there are entire movements of Buddhism based on a
misspelling of words due to ignorance of such basic details. Having said
which, the use of Roman characters is by no means a sure way of guarding
against mispronunciation or misunderstanding. Pali may be perfectly well
represented by many scripts, and the only real guard against
misunderstanding is, as the Dhammapada itself teaches us, heedfulness.

The first complete and rigorous translation into English was that by Max
Müller through Clarendon Press in 1870, revised in 1881 and 1898. Müller
was one of the founding fathers of Indology, although by his own
admission Pali and Buddhism were not his primary focus. His work greatly
influenced later translators, and in addition, contained an extensive
discussion of historical matters.

It was not until 1914 that the Pali Text Society published its edition,
which was edited by Sūriyagoda Sumaṅgala Thera based on printed editions
in Burmese, Thai, and Sinhalese characters, as well as "two reliable
manuscripts" in his possession. The edition carefully notes variant
readings and cross-references and became the standard edition for
international Pali studies until replaced by the 1994 PTS edition by O.
von Hinüber and K. R. Norman.

Finally I should mention the excellent edition of the Dhammapada by
Ānandajoti Bhikkhu, originally in 2002 and last updated in 2016. This is
primarily a revision and correction of the Buddha Jayanthi text but
takes into consideration the PTS and other editions, as well as an
extensive comparative study with the Patna Dharmapada.

Thus far a cursory and incomplete survey of Pali editions has taken us,
and I have barely scratched the surface of the translations, which
number over 70 in English alone. I will simply note here that when
looking for assistance in unraveling the knotty problems of the text I
turned first of all to the work of K.R. Norman and Ven. Ānandajoti. I
also referred from time to time to the translations of Ven.
Buddharakkhita and Ven. Ṭhānissaro, the latter of whom sometimes catches
aesthetic nuances that a linguist might miss.

# Colophon

## The Translator

[Bhikkhu Sujato]{property="dc:creator"} was born as Anthony Aidan Best
on [4/11/1966]{.dc:date} in Perth, Western Australia. He grew up in the
pleasant suburbs of Mt Lawley and Attadale alongside his sister Nicola,
who was the good child. His mother, Margaret Lorraine Huntsman née
Pinder, said "he'll either be a priest or a poet", while his father,
Anthony Thomas Best, advised him to "never do anything for money". He
attended Aquinas College, a Catholic school, where he decided to become
an atheist. At the University of WA he studied philosophy, aiming to
learn what he wanted to do with his life. Finding that what he wanted to
do was play guitar, he dropped out. His main band was named Martha's
Vineyard, which achieved modest success in the indie circuit.

A seemingly random encounter with a roadside joey took him to Thailand,
where he entered his first meditation retreat at Wat Ram Poeng, Chieng
Mai in 1992. Feeling the call to the Buddha's path, he took full
ordination in Wat Pa Nanachat in 1994, where his teachers were Ajahn
Pasanno and Ajahn Jayasaro. In 1997 he returned to Perth to study with
Ajahn Brahm at Bodhinyana Monastery.

He spent several years practicing in seclusion in Malaysia and Thailand
before establishing Santi Forest Monastery in Bundanoon, NSW, in 2003.
There he was instrumental in supporting the establishment of the
Theravada bhikkhuni order in Australia and advocating for women's
rights. He continues to teach in Australia and globally, with a special
concern for the moral implications of climate change and other forms of
environmental destruction. He has published a series of books of
original and groundbreaking research on early Buddhism.

In 2005 he founded SuttaCentral together with Rod Bucknell and John
Kelly. In 2015, seeing the need for a complete, accurate, plain English
translation of the Pali texts, he undertook the task, spending nearly
three years in isolation on the isle of Qi Mei off the coast of the
nation of Taiwan. He completed the four main Nikāyas in 2018, and the
early books of the Khuddaka Nikāya were complete by 2021. All this work
is dedicated to the public domain and is entirely free of copyright
encumbrance.

In 2019 he returned to Sydney where he established Lokanta Vihara (The
Monastery at the End of the World).

## Creation Process

Translated from the Pali. The primary source was the Mahāsaṅgīti
edition, with reference to several English translations, especially
those of K.R. Norman and Venerable Buddharakkhita.

## The Translation

This translation aims to make a clear, readable, and accurate rendering
of the Dhammapada. Unlike most Dhammapadas in English, this is a new
translation from the source Pali text. The aim was to make the sense as
transparent as possible.

## About SuttaCentral

SuttaCentral publishes early Buddhist texts. Since 2005 we have provided
root texts in Pali, Chinese, Sanskrit, Tibetan, and other languages,
parallels between these texts, and translations in many modern
languages. Building on the work of generations of scholars, we offer our
contribution freely.

SuttaCentral is driven by volunteer contributions, and in addition we
employ professional developers. We offer a sponsorship program for high
quality translations from the original languages. Financial support for
SuttaCentral is handled by the SuttaCentral Development Trust, a
charitable trust registered in Australia.

## About Bilara

"Bilara" means "cat" in Pali, and it is the name of our Computer
Assisted Translation (CAT) software. Bilara is a web app that enables
translators to translate early Buddhist texts into their own language.
These translations are published on SuttaCentral with the root text and
translation side by side.

## About SuttaCentral Editions

The SuttaCentral Editions project makes high quality books from selected
Bilara translations. These are published in formats including HTML,
EPUB, PDF, and print.

You are welcome to print any of our Editions.
